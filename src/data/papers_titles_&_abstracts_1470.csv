Methamphetamine use has increased dramatically over the past decade and is associated with the development of heart failure (HF). However, clinical characteristics and outcomes have not been well described. This study aimed to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes among individuals with HF who do and do not use methamphetamines in a safety-net hospital.
Method
This retrospective matched cohort study included all individuals with HF with history of methamphetamine use and age, gender-, and year-matched controls without history of methamphetamine use within a municipal health system from 2001-2019. 1,783 individuals with methamphetamine use and HF were identified; 12 were excluded due to inability to identify matched methamphetamine-negative controls. Therefore, 1,771 individuals with methamphetamine use and heart failure and 3,542 age, sex, and year-of-HF-diagnosis matched controls with heart failure without methamphetamine use were included. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included time to HF hospitalization, and 30-day, 90-day, and 1 year HF and all-cause readmissions.  
Results
Median age of the cohort was 52.1 years and 22.6% were female. There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (40% vs 36.6%, HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91, 1.10, p=1.00). A subset had an index HF hospitalization (n=1,404) during the study period including 637 (35.9%) with history of methamphetamine use and 767 (21.7%) without history of methamphetamine use (relative risk 1.66, 95%CI 1.52-1.81, p<0.0001). Among those ever hospitalized for HF, individuals with methamphetamine use had increased odds of HF and all-cause readmission at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year. 
Conclusion
Despite having higher risk of both all cause and HF readmissions, individuals with methamphetamine-associated heart failure did not have higher risk of mortality. Measures to address frequent healthcare utilization among people with methamphetamine use and HF are needed."

In this study, we evaluated the association of CPB and aortic cross-clamping (ACC) times with systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) and systemic immune inflammation index (SIII) in isolated coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).
Methods: 96 patients who underwent isolated CABG at a single center between 2021 and 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into below median aortic clamp time (group I; n=56) and above median aortic clamp time (group II; n=42) according to median aortic clamp time (66.2 minutes). Demographic data, preoperative and postoperative laboratory parameters were recorded. SIRI and SIII values were calculated.
Results: Baseline demographic data were similar between the groups. The duration of CPB and aortic clamping was significantly longer in group II (p<0.001). SIII and SIRI values were significantly increased in both groups in the postoperative period. However, there was no correlation between increased CPB and ACC durations and SIII and SIRI. However, no significant difference was observed in postoperative SIII and SIRI values between the groups. A weak correlation was found between SIII index and postoperative albumin levels.
Conclusions: There is no significant relationship between aortic clamping time and inflammatory indices in patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery. Increasing the duration of surgery does not affect the change in SIRI and SIII values."

Objective: To determine the trends and factors associated with these diseases' isolated and combined presence in both dual and triple forms (metabolic triad).
Methods: Secondary data analysis from the Demographic and Family Health Survey for 2014 to 2022. The primary variable had seven categories, ranging from isolated states to triple combinations. Given the polytomous nature of the dependent variable, multinomial logistic regression models were constructed. The results of these models are presented in the form of adjusted odds ratios, accompanied by their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results: Among the isolated forms, obesity was the most prevalent comorbidity (15.35%), while T2DM was the least common (1.14%). Among the combined forms, the most frequent was obesity and HTN (6.40%). The prevalence of the metabolic triad was low (0.84%). The factors commonly related to each were female sex, age, urban residency, region, economic level, daily smoking, alcohol consumption, and altitude.
Conclusions: An increasing prevalence of HTN, T2DM, and obesity was found, both individually and in their various combinations. Furthermore, the complexity and sometimes contradictory nature of the associated factors, which can increase or decrease the presence of these metabolic diseases, reflect the need for a personalized approach to prevention and treatment."

Reducing low-value care (LVC) and improving healthcare’s climate readiness are critical factors to improve the sustainability of health systems across the globe. Care practices that have been deemed low or no value, in effect, generate carbon emissions, waste and pollution without improving patient or population health. There is nascent, but growing, research and evaluation to inform practice change focused on the environmental co-benefits of reducing LVC. The objective of this study was to develop foundational knowledge of this field through a scoping review and bibliometric analysis.
Methods:
We searched four databases, Medline, Embase, Scopus and CINAHL, each from inception to July 2023. We followed established scoping review and bibliometric analysis methodology to collect and analyze the data. Publication characteristics, healthcare and environmental sustainability focus (scoping review); authors, institutions, institution countries, and collaborations (bibliometric analysis) data were collected.
Findings:
145 publications met inclusion criteria and were published between 2013 – July 2023; with over 80% published since 2020. Empirical studies represented 21% while commentary, editorials or opinions represented 51% of publications. The majority focused on healthcare generally (27%), followed by laboratory testing (14%), and medications (14%). Empirical publications covered a broad range of environmental issues with general and practice-specific ‘Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions’, ‘waste management’ and ‘resource use’ as most common topics. Reducing practice-specific ‘GHG emissions’ was the most common reported environmental outcome. The bibliometric analysis revealed numerous international collaboration networks of prolific authors producing work across healthcare practices and settings, studying numerous environmental sustainability issues.
Conclusions:
This study reveals that research and evaluation to inform practice change on the environmental co-benefits of reducing LVC is growing internationally, across multiple healthcare and environmental areas. Results demonstrate a need and opportunity for the emerging community to clarify approaches and strengthen the evidence-base through further empirical work in the field."

Here, we combined a naturalistic fMRI-design inducing high and immersive fear experience in social and non-social contexts with a preregistered between-subjects randomized double-blind placebo-controlled intranasal OT trial (24 IU, n = 67 healthy men). OT reduced subjective fear in non-social and social contexts with small or moderate effect sizes, respectively. In the social fear contexts, OT enhanced left middle cingulate cortex (lMCC) activation and its functional connectivity with the contralateral amygdala, with both neural indices significantly and inversely associated with subjective fear following OT. On the network level, OT enhanced communication between the dorsal attention network (DAN) with the fronto-parietal (FPN) and the default-mode network (DMN) as well as on the more fine-grained level brain-wide communication. These findings indicate a fear-reducing potential of OT under naturalistic conditions with pronounced effects in social contexts, suggesting a high treatment value in disorders with social context-related excessive fear."

Methods: Between July 21, 2020, and July 29, 2021, 13,166 participants provided informed consent, with 12,688 randomized for the trial. Participants were allocated between vaccine and placebo arms (1:1) and monitored for symptomatic COVID-19 cases, severity of disease, and adverse reactions after two doses given 14 days apart.
Findings: The primary efficacy analysis revealed a vaccine efficacy of 50.39% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.26% to 61.98%; p=0.0049) in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, leading to the issuance of Emergency Use Authorization for CoronaVac in January 2021. Upon completion of follow-up, vaccine efficacy was 44⸱58% [95% CI, 34.89% to 52.83%; p= 0.0023] in preventing COVID-19 and 82⸱14% (95% CI, 64.93% to 90.90%; p<0.0001) in preventing severe COVID-19. Safety data indicated that adverse reactions were more frequent in the vaccine arm, primarily mild to moderate, with pain at the injection site and headache being the most common.
Interpretation: CoronaVac demonstrated moderate efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and high efficacy against severe disease. While reactions were slightly more common in the vaccine group, they were generally mild and manageable."

Accessing Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) is associated with out-of-pocket costs and stigma. Video-observed therapy (VOT) is an alternative to DOT but evidence from LMIC with high TB burden is limited. To make recommendations for future VOT-related research and inform the design of a pilot implementation of VOT for people with multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) in Mozambique, we did a scoping review of the evidence on VOT for people with TB.
Methodology: We systematically searched five scientific databases and key grey literature repositories to identify eligible abstracts. Abstracts were reviewed and full-text records were identified and evaluated. Data from full-text records were extracted into four implementation theme categories: Feasibility, Acceptability, Cost, and Effectiveness (FACE). Content analysis was used to describe implementation successes and challenges, comparing VOT versus DOT where possible. The Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool (CCAT) was used to evaluate the quality of studies. 
Results: In total, 66 records were identified: 47 primary research studies, 13 reviews, and six grey literature documents. All studies were graded as moderate to high quality and reported against at least one FACE category. Studies from urban settings (n=34) and HIC (n=33) predominated. Where measured and described, VOT implementation was reported to be feasible (43/43, 100%) and acceptable (43/44, 97%). Of the 18/20 (90%) studies describing cost data, VOT was reported to offer savings to the health system compared to DOT. Patient costs were under-reported. Of the 21/23 (91%) studies describing effectiveness to improve adherence to TB treatment, VOT was reported to be non-inferior to DOT.  
Conclusion: In HIC settings, VOT was reported as feasible, acceptable, and similarly effective alternative to DOT. Further evidence on VOT is needed from LMIC with high TB burden."

Objectives: Perform the first large-scale X chromosome-wide association study (XWAS) of AD. Primary analyses are non-stratified, while secondary analyses evaluate sex-stratified effects.

Design: Meta-analysis of genetic association studies in case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts from the US Alzheimer[prime]s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and Alzheimer[prime]s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), the UK Biobank (UKB), the Finnish health registry (FinnGen), and the US Million Veterans Program (MVP). Risk for AD evaluated through case-control logistic regression analyses. Data were analyzed between January 2023 and March 2024.

Setting: Genetic data available from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Summary statistics for multi-tissue expression and protein quantitative trait loci (QTL) available from published studies, enabling follow-up genetic colocalization analyses.

Participants: 1,629,863 eligible participants were selected from referred and volunteer samples, of which 477,596 were excluded for analysis exclusion criteria. Number of participants who declined to participate in original studies was not available. 
Main Outcome and Measures: Risk for AD (odds ratio; OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Associations were considered at X-chromosome-wide (P-value<1e-5) and genome-wide (P-value<5e-8) significance. 

Results: Analyses included 1,152,284 non-Hispanic White European ancestry subjects (57.3% females), including 138,558 cases. 6 independent genetic loci passed X-chromosome-wide significance, with 4 showing support for causal links between the genetic signal for AD and expression of nearby genes in brain and non-brain tissues. One of these 4 loci passed conservative genome-wide significance, with its lead variant centered on an intron of SLC9A7 (OR=1.054, 95%-CI=[1.035, 1.075]) and colocalization analyses prioritizing both the SLC9A7 and nearby CHST7 genes.

Conclusion and Relevance: We performed the first large-scale XWAS of AD and identified the novel SLC9A7 locus. SLC9A7 regulates pH homeostasis in Golgi secretory compartments and is anticipated to have downstream effects on amyloid beta accumulation. Overall, this study significantly advances our knowledge of AD genetics and may provide novel biological drug targets."

It is unknown what proportion of younger Veterans achieve and maintain BP control after hypertension onset and if BP control differs by demographics and social deprivation.
Methods: Electronic health records were merged from Veterans who enrolled in VA care 10/1/2001-9/30/2017 and met criteria for hypertension – first diagnosis or antihypertensive fill. BP control (140/90 mmHg) was estimated 1, 2, and 5 years post-hypertension documentation, and characterized by sex, race, and ethnicity. Adjusted logistic regressions assessed likelihood of BP control by these demographics and with the Social Deprivation Index (SDI).
Results: Overall, 17% patients met criteria for hypertension (n=198,367; 11% of women, median age 41). One year later, 59% of men and 65% of women achieved BP control. After adjustment, women had a 72% greater odds of BP control than men, with minimal change over 5 years. Black adults had a 22% lower odds of BP control than White adults. SDI did not significantly change these results.
Conclusions: In the largest study of hypertension in younger Veterans, 41% of men and 35% of women did not have BP control after 1 year, and BP control was consistently better for women through 5 years. Thus, the first year of hypertension management portends future, long-term BP control. As social deprivation did not affect BP control, the VA system may protect against disadvantages observed in the general U.S. population."

Although interoperability is the gold standard, it is also complex and costly, requiring technical expertise, stakeholder permissions, and sustained funding. Manual data linkage processes are commonly used to integrate across systems and allow for assessment of DHI impact, a best practice, before further investment. For mHealth, the manual data linkage workload, including related monitoring and evaluation  (M&E) activities,  remains poorly understood. 

Methodology: As a baseline study for an open-source app to mirror EMRS and reduce healthcare worker (HCW) workload while improving care in the Nurse-led Community-based Antiretroviral therapy Program (NCAP) in Lilongwe, Malawi, we conducted a time-motion study observing HCWs completing data management activities, including routine M&E and manual data linkage of individual-level app data to EMRS. Data management tasks should reduce or end with successful app implementation and EMRS integration. Data was analysed in Excel. 

Results: We observed 69:53:00 of HCWs performing routine NCAP service delivery tasks: 39:52:00 (57%) was spent completing M&E data related tasks of which 15:57:00 (23%) was spent on manual data linkage workload, alone. 

Conclusion: Understanding the workload to ensure quality M&E data, including to complete manual data linkage of mHealth apps to EMRS, provides stakeholders with inputs to drive DHI innovations and integration decision making. Quantifying potential mHealth benefits on more efficient, high-quality M&E data may trigger new innovations to reduce workloads and strengthen evidence to spur continuous improvement."

This systematic review aimed to summarize the range and characteristics of quantitative bias analysis (QBA) methods for summary level data published in the peer-reviewed literature.
Study Design and Setting: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science for English-language articles describing QBA methods. For each QBA method, we recorded key characteristics, including applicable study designs, bias(es) addressed; bias parameters, and publicly available software. The study protocol was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/ue6vm/).
Results: Our search identified 10,249 records, of which 53 were articles describing 57 QBA methods for summary level data. Of the 57 QBA methods, 51 (89%) were explicitly designed for observational studies, 2 (4%) for non-randomized interventional studies, and 4 (7%) for meta-analyses. There were 29 (51%) QBA methods that addressed unmeasured confounding, 20 (35%) misclassification bias, 5 (9%) selection bias, and 3 (5%) multiple biases. 38 (67%) QBA methods were designed to generate bias-adjusted effect estimates and 18 (32%) were designed to describe how bias could explain away observed findings. 22 (39%) articles provided code or online tools to implement the QBA methods. 
Conclusion: In this systematic review, we identified a total of 57 QBA methods for summary level epidemiologic data published in the peer-reviewed literature. Future investigators can use this systematic review to identify different QBA methods for summary level epidemiologic data."

Nevertheless, these infants are still at increased risk for long-term impairments as compared to term-born infants. This situation often leaves parents coping with anxiety and a sense of unpreparedness, as they navigate the transition to home. While the homecoming of a preterm born infant is long awaited and brings relief to families, it also marks the end of intensive monitoring and highly specialized professional care. Correspondingly, the World Health Organisation (WHO) advocates for additional support for parents of preterm infants following the transition to home. According to the WHO, preparation for this transition yields positive effects on crucial aspects such as nutrition, parent-child interaction, and parental well-being. Consequently, we aimed to provide an overview of existing transition to home interventions and their efficacy, by conducting a systematic review of the literature. 
Methods: We will perform a systematic review of interventions aiming at improving the transition to home process for very preterm-born infants and their parents and will search the following databases: Cochrane, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Our main aim is to provide an overview over the existing interventions, and their efficacy. Thus, we will not predefine specific outcomes, but we will describe, assess and summarize the outcomes of the included studies. 
Discussion: This systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current interventions designed to improve the transition from hospital to home. Subsequently, it will show the individual effect of these interventions and pool effect sizes if possible. The most promising interventions will then be combined and used as the basis of a subsequent randomized controlled trial of a new transition to home intervention.
Systematic review registration: The systematic review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on August 30, 2023. PROSPERO CRD42023455401"

However, any causal relationship between gut microbiota alterations and PC risk remains unknown. 
Methods: We comprehensively investigated PC-related microorganisms in European and East Asian populations through the application of Mendelian randomization (MR). The PC genome-wide association study (GWAS) databases for European and East Asian individuals were acquired from the UK and Japanese Biobanks, respectively. Primary analytical methods, including the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, weighted median, Maximum likelihood method and MR PRESSO, were employed to estimate the potential causal association between gut microbiota and PC. Additionally, we performed sensitivity analysis and reverse MR analysis.
Results: By IVW method, overall 17 bacterial taxa were identified with potential causal correlations to PC. The PC-associated gut microbiota signatures varied across different populations. Among these, 4 specific taxa exhibited potential causality with PC, with statistical significance in all four MR methods. Specifically, the Alcaligenaceae family was identified as protective, while genus Sutterella, order Bacilliales and genus Enterohabdus were associated with increased risk of PC. Among the European population within the UK biobank, the Alcaligenaceae family, genus Sutterella, and order Bacillales were connected to PC, while genus Enterohabdus was linked to PC in the Japanese cohort. 
Conclusion: Our study implicates certain members of the gut microbiota in PC onset based on genetics. Further investigations of the gut-pancreas axis may lead to the development of novel microbiome targeted prevention strategies for PC."

The last two years have seen mpox emerge as a notable pandemic threat. The global 2022-23 outbreak of clade II mpox caused over 93,000 cases worldwide, while the 2023-24 epidemic of the more severe clade I virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has caused over 14,000 cases and over 650 deaths thus far. Of particular concern is that both case incidence and mortality in the DRC outbreak are concentrated in children. However, quantification of age variation in severity for clade I infections has been lacking to date.

Methods
Using Bayesian binomial regression models, we analysed data from systematically reviewed clade I outbreaks to estimate case fatality ratios (CFR) by age, smallpox vaccination status and over time. We compared model predictive performance using leave-one-out cross-validation and compared our findings to the ongoing DRC outbreak.

Findings
The CFR had a near-reciprocal relationship with age, declining from 9.7% (95% credible interval: 6.9%-13.0%) among 5-year-olds to 1.2% (95%CrI: 0.3%-3.7%) by age 30. Accounting for vaccination status in addition to age did not improve model fit, but posterior parameter estimates suggest substantial vaccine-protection against death. Reanalysis incorporating cases from the ongoing DRC outbreak suggested less steep declines in severity with age and a protective effect of vaccination against death of 64% (95%CrI: -3.4%-95.6%) and reduction in severity over time.
 
Interpretation
We provide estimates of the mpox clade I CFR in historically endemic settings by vaccine status, and find the highest risk of death in the youngest children.

The association between preoperative wearable device step counts and surgical outcomes has not been examined using commercial devices linked to electronic health records (EHR) at a population level. This study measured the association between daily preoperative step counts and postoperative complications. 
 
Study Design
Data was obtained using the All of Us (AOU) Research program, a nationwide initiative to collect EHR and health-related data from the population. Included were patients who underwent a surgical procedure included in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) targeted procedures dataset. Excluded were patients without complete perioperative FitBit data. Primary outcome was the development of a postoperative complication. All analyses were performed in the AOU researcher workbench. 
 
Results
Of 27,150 patients who underwent a surgical procedure, 475 participants with preoperative wearable data were included. 74.7% were female and 85.2% were White. The average age was 57.2 years. The overall rate of postoperative complications was 12.6%. Patients averaging fewer than 7,500 daily steps were at increased odds for developing a postoperative complication (OR 1.83, 95% CI [1.01, 3.31]). Following adjustment for age, sex, race, comorbid disease, body mass index (BMI), and relative procedure risk, patients with a baseline average steps/day < 7,500 were at increased odds for postoperative complication (aOR = 2.06, 95% CI [1.05, 4.06]). 
 
Conclusions
This study found an increase in overall postoperative complication rate in patients recording lower average preoperative step counts. Patients with a baseline of less than 7,500 steps per day had increased odds of postoperative complications in this cohort. This population data supports the use of wearable devices for surgical risk stratification and suggests step count may help to measure preoperative fitness."

Histotype assignment of epithelial ovarian cancers can be challenging due to morphologic overlap, inter-observer variability, and the lack of ancillary diagnostic techniques in some areas of the world. Moreover, rare cancers can pose particular diagnostic difficulties because of a relative lack of familiarity with them, underscoring the necessity for robust diagnostic methodologies. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought promising prospects to the realm of ovarian cancer diagnosis. While various studies have underscored AI's promise, its validation across multiple healthcare centers and hospitals has been limited.

Methods: A deep-learning based, integrated, robust, and deployable workflow from several motion-corrupted individual T2-weighted single-shot Turbo Spin Echo stacks to produce super-resolved 3D reconstructed fetal brain and body is enabled by combining automated deformable and rigid Slice-to-Volume (D/SVR) reconstruction adapted for low field MRI with a real-time scanner-based Gadgetron workflow. Qualitative evaluation of the pipeline in terms of image quality and efficiency is performed in 12 prospectively acquired fetal datasets from the 22-40 weeks gestational age range.
Results: The reconstructions were available on average 6:42+-3:13 minutes after the acquisition of the final stack and could be assessed and archived on the scanner console during the ongoing fetal MRI scan. The output image data quality was rated as good to acceptable for interpretation. The additional retrospective testing of the pipeline on 83 0.55T datasets demonstrated stable reconstruction quality for low-field MRI.
Conclusion: The proposed pipeline allows scanner-based prospective motion correction for low-field fetal MRI. The main novel components of this work are the compilation of automated fetal and body D/SVR methods into one combined pipeline, the first application of 3D reconstruction methods to 0.55T T2-weighted data, and the online integration into the scanner environment."

It also contributes to women general better access to health. The goal of PARTAGE study was to evaluate the level and determinants of adherence to a prenatal prevention consultation dedicated to men.
Methods: Between January 2021 and April 2022, we conducted a monocentric interventional study in Montreuil hospital. We assessed the acceptance of a prenatal prevention consultation newly offered to every future father, through their pregnant partner's prior consent to provide their contact details.
Results: 3,038 women provided contact information used to reach the fathers; effective contact was established with 2,516 men, of whom 1,333 (53%) came for prenatal prevention consultation. Immigrant men were more likely to come than French-born men (56% versus 49%, p < 0.001), and the more they faced social hardship, the more likely they were to accept the offer. In multivariate analysis, men born in Subsaharan Africa and Asia were twice as likely to attend the consultation as those born in Europe or North America.
Conclusion: Acceptance of this new offer was high. Moreover, this consultation was perceived by vulnerable immigrant men as an opportunity to integrate a healthcare system they would otherwise remain deprived of."

The indication is based on the combination of clinical and radiological examination and individual patient parameters and should be made with great care. However, determining whether a tooth should be extracted is not always a straightforward decision. Moreover, visual and cognitive pitfalls in the analysis of radiographs may lead to incorrect decisions. Artificial intelligence (AI) could be used as a decision support tool to provide a score of tooth extractability. 
Material and Methods: Using 26,956 single teeth images from 1,184 panoramic radiographs (PANs), we trained a ResNet50 network to classify teeth as either extraction-worthy or preservable. For this purpose, teeth were cropped with different margins from PANs and annotated. The usefulness of the AI-based classification as well that of dentists was evaluated on a test dataset. In addition, the explainability of the best AI model was visualized via a class activation mapping using CAMERAS.
Results: The ROC-AUC for the best AI model to discriminate teeth worthy of preservation was 0.901 with 2% margin on dental images. In contrast, the average ROC-AUC for dentists was only 0.797.  With a 19.1% tooth extractions prevalence, the AI model's PR-AUC was 0.749, while the human evaluation only reached 0.589.
Conclusion: AI models outperform dentists/specialists in predicting tooth extraction based solely on X-ray images, while the AI performance improves with increasing contextual information. 
Clinical Relevance: AI could help monitor at-risk teeth and reduce errors in indications for extractions."

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events. Method: We did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Children's Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains. Findings: Coincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n≤177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0.01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0.05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0.01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization. Interpretation: We identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China."

Marfan syndrome (MFS) guidelines recommend optimal pharmacological therapy (OPT) and replacement of the ascending aorta (RAA) at 5.0cm diameters to prevent acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) and death. The effect of early MFS diagnosis and initiation of therapy on outcomes is not known.
Objective. To evaluate the effect of age at MFS diagnosis and therapy initiation on delayed RAA and death.
Methods. This retrospective observational cohort study with long-term follow-up included consecutive patients with MFS, pathogenic FBN1 variant, and regular visits to a European Reference Network Center. We considered MFS diagnosis at age ≥21 years late, and OPT initiation at age <21 years early. Outcomes were delayed RAA with aneurysm diameter >5.0cm or ATAAD, and death from all causes. We used landmark design starting at age 21 years to determine associations with outcomes.
Results. The study group consisted of 288 patients (45.1% male), including 169 patients with late MFS diagnosis (58.7%) and 63 with early OPT (21.9%). During mean follow-up of 25±14.7 years, 78 patients had delayed RAA, with 42 operations for ATAAD and 36 for aneurysms 5.0cm. There were 33 deaths, including 11 deaths late after ATAAD. All deaths were cardiovascular. Late diagnosis, but not early OPT, showed univariate association with delayed RAA (P<0.001) and death (P=0.025). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed late diagnosis as predictor of delayed RAA (hazard ratio (HR)=8.01; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 2.52-25.45; P<0.001) and death (HR=4.68; 95%CI 1.17-18.80; P=0.029). 
Conclusions. Late diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is associated with delayed surgery and death."

However, previous observational data reported hyperlipidemia as a risk factor for both ischemic and bleeding complications in patients with AF and previous stroke. Based on these premises, we conducted a sub-analysis of the RAF and RAF-NOAC studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins in secondary prevention in patients with acute ischemic stroke and AF. 

Methods: We combined patient data from the RAF and RAF-NOAC studies. We included consecutive patients with AF who suffered an acute ischemic stroke with a follow-up of 90 days. Our outcomes were the combined endpoint, including stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and major extracranial bleeding. Furthermore, both ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes were evaluated separately. 

Results: A total of 1.742 patients were included, 898 (52%) received statins after the index event. At multivariable analysis, statin use was statistically associated with age (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.97 - 0.99, p = 0.001), male sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.70, p = 0.013), anticoagulation (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.90 - 3.36, p <0.0001), hyperlipidemia (OR 5.52, 95% CI 4.28 - 7.12, p <0.0001), paroxysmal AF (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 - 1.75, p = 0.003), leukoaraiosis (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.11 - 1.75, p = 0.004) and heart failure (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 - 0.98, p = 0.034). Statin use was not associated with the combined outcome event (OR 0,81, 95% CI 0,56 ? 1,19, p = 0.286) and ischemic outcome event (OR 1,13, 95% CI 0,71 ? 1,82, p = 0.604) while was associated with a lower risk of hemorrhagic outcome event (OR 0,49, 95% CI 0,27 ? 0,88, p = 0.016).  

Conclusions: Statins seem to protect against global bleeding events in cardioembolic stroke patients; this may be due to the pleiotropic effect of statins."

However, the lack of dynamic level of viral shedding in the wastewater and accurate number of infections in the community creates challenges in predicting COVID-19 prevalence in the population and interpreting WBE results. In this study, we measured SARS-CoV-2, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), and human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in longitudinal fecal samples collected from 42 COVID-19 patients for up to 42 days after diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 73.1% (19/26) of inpatient study participants in at least one of the collected fecal specimens during the sampling period. Most participants shed the virus within three weeks after diagnosis, but five inpatient participants still shed the virus between 20 and 60 days after diagnosis. The median concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in positive fecal samples was 1.08x105 genome copies (GC)/gram dry fecal material. PMMoV and mtDNA were detected in 99.4% (154/155) and 100% (155/155) of all fecal samples, respectively. The median concentrations of PMMoV RNA and mtDNA in fecal samples were 1.73x107 and 2.49x108 GC/dry gram, respectively.  These results provide important information about the dynamics of fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 and two human fecal indicators in COVID-19 patients. mtDNA showed higher positive rates, higher concentrations, and less variability between and within individuals than PMMoV, suggesting that mtDNA could be a better normalization factor for WBE results than PMMoV."

Yet, an efficient, automatic method to select appropriate dynamic images for training is still largely missing.
Methods: We developed DL models using 254 coronary angiographic studies from the Mayo Clinic. We utilized two state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN: ResNet and X3D), to identify low quality angiograms through binary classification (satisfactory/unsatisfactory). Ground truth for the quality of the input angiogram was determined by two experienced cardiologists. We validated the developed model in an independent dataset of 3,208 procedures from 3 Mayo sites. 
Results: 3D-CNN models outperformed their 2D counterparts, with the X3D model achieving superior performance across all metrics (AUC 0.98, precision 0.86, and sensitivity 0.89). The 2D models processed the video clips faster than 3D models. Despite having a 3D architecture, the X3D model had lower computational demand (2.56 GMAC) and parameter count (2.98 M) than 2D models. When validating models on the independent dataset, slight decreases in AUC and sensitivity were observed but accuracy and specificity remained robust (0.88 and 0.89, respectively for the X3D model).
Conclusion: We developed a rapid and effective method for automating the selection of coronary angiogram video clips using 3D-CNNs, potentially improving model accuracy and efficiency in clinical applications. The X3D-S model demonstrates a balanced trade-off between computational efficiency and complexity, making it suitable for real-life clinical applications."

Identification of patients at early risk for CVD improves risk stratification and patient management. Triglyceride glucose index can be used as a marker of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
This study was approved by IRB of the institute and conducted in the period of July 2020 to June 2022 in the Chemical Pathology laboratory of Indus Hospital. All patients whose cardiac intervention (PCI/LHC) performed were included.  Fasting lipid profile was analyzed on Alinity C analyzer, and FBS was measured on glucometer. 
TyG index was calculated, 54% have TyG index more than 9.04. Male predominance was observed, with 68.6% falling within the <9.04 range and 60.4% within the >9.04 range. Patients aged over 50, constituting 51 (59.3%) in the <9.04 TG index group and 60 (59.4%) in the >9.04 TG index group. Patients with TyG index <9.04, majority FBS is in pre-diabetic range 45.3% while TyG index >9.04 group, majority FBS is in diabetic range with a p-value of <0.001. Our study demonstrated that the TyG index was independently associated with atherosclerosis in our population and this marker can be used for the prediction of disease for healthy individuals."

Yet, the modifiable and non-modifiable factors in metabolomic aging have not been systematically studied. Here, we leveraged metabolomic profiles of 239,291 UK Biobank participants for 10-year all-cause mortality prediction to generate and validate a new aging measure--MetaboAgeMort. The MetaboAgeMort showed significant associations with all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and diverse incident diseases. Adding MetaboAgeMort to conventional risk factors model improved the predictive ability of 10-year mortality. We identified 99 modifiable factors for MetaboAgeMort, where 16 factors representing pulmonary function, body composition, socioeconomic status, dietary quality, smoking status, alcohol intake, and disease status showed quantitatively stronger associations. The genetic analyses revealed 99 genomic risk loci and 271 genes associated with MetaboAgeMort. Our study illuminates heterogeneous metabolomic aging across the same age, which provides avenues for developing anti-aging therapies and personalized interventions."

This study investigates what drives these differences. We constructed a probabilistic case count model for 306 administrative regions of England across 95 weeks, fit using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework. We include the mechanistic impact of acquired immunity, of spatial exportation of cases, and 16 spatially-varying socio-economic, socio-demographic, health, and mobility variables. Model comparison assesses the relative contributions of these respective mechanisms. We find that regionally-varying and time-varying differences in week-to-week transmission were definitively associated with differences in: time spent at home, variant-of-concern proportion, and adult social care funding. However, model comparison demonstrates that the mechanistic impact of these terms was of negligible impact compared to the role of spatial exportation between regions. While these results confirm the impact of some, but not all, measures of regional inequity in England, our work corroborates the finding that observed differences in regional disease transmission during the pandemic were predominantly driven by underlying epidemiological factors rather than the demography and health inequity between regions."

This co-endemic malaria study from Guyana details important epidemiological contrasts between the species by coupling population genomics (1,396 spatiotemporally-matched parasite genomes) with sociodemographic analysis (nationwide patient census). We describe how P. falciparum forms large, interrelated subpopulations that sporadically expand but generally exhibit restrained dispersal, whereby spatial distance and patient travel statistics predict parasite identity-by-descent (IBD). Case bias towards working-age adults is also strongly pronounced. P. vivax exhibits 46% higher average diversity (π) and 6.5x lower average IBD. It occupies a wider geographic range, without evidence for outbreak-like expansions, only microgeographic patterns of isolation-by-distance, and weaker case bias towards adults. Possible latency-relapse effects also manifest in various analyses. For example, 11.0% of patients diagnosed with P. vivax in Greater Georgetown report no recent travel to endemic zones, and P. vivax clones recur in 11/46 patients incidentally sampled twice during the study. Polyclonality rate is also 2.1x higher than in P. falciparum, does not trend positively with estimated incidence, and correlates uniquely to selected demographics. We discuss possible underlying mechanisms and implications for malaria control."

Neural hyperactivity has been reported on average in cancer survivors, but it is unclear which patients demonstrate this neurophenotype, limiting precision medicine in this population.  We evaluated a retrospective sample of 80 breast cancer survivors and 80 non-cancer controls, age 35-73, for which we had previously identified and validated three data-driven, biological subgroups (biotypes) of CRCI.  We measured neural activity using the z-normalized percent amplitude of fluctuation from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We tested established, quantitative criteria to determine if hyperactivity can accurately be considered compensatory.  We also calculated brain age gap by applying a previously validated algorithm to anatomic MRI.  We found that neural activity differed across the three CRCI biotypes and controls (F = 13.5, p < 0.001), with Biotype 2 demonstrating significant hyperactivity compared to the other groups (p < 0.004, corrected), primarily in prefrontal regions. Alternatively, Biotypes 1 and 3 demonstrated significant hypoactivity (p < 0.02, corrected). Hyperactivity in Biotype 2 met several of the criteria to be considered compensatory. However, we also found a positive relationship between neural activity and brain age gap in these patients (r = 0.45, p = 0.042). Our results indicated that neural hyperactivity is specific to a subgroup of breast cancer survivors and, while it seems to support preserved cognitive function, it could also increase the risk of accelerated brain aging.  These findings could inform future neuromodulatory interventions with respect to the risks and benefits of up or downregulation of neural activity."

Brazil has a highly admixed population. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) have been mostly developed from European population studies and applying them to other populations is challenging. To assess the use of PRS for breast cancer (BC) risk in Brazil, we validated four PRSs developed in the Brazilian population.

Patients and Methods
We analyzed 6,362 women with a history of breast cancer and 9,128 unphenotyped adults as controls in a sample obtained from a clinical laboratory. Genomic variants were imputed from exomes and scores were calculated for all samples.

Results
After excluding individuals with known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, PTEN, or TP53, and first-degree relatives of the probands, 5,730 cases and 8,847 controls remained. Four PRS models were compared, and PRS 3820 from Mavaddat et al. 2019 performed best, with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.41 per standard deviation (SD) increase (p-value: < 0.0001) and an OR of 1.94 (p-value: < 0.0001) for the individuals in the top risk decile. PRS 3820 also performed well for different ancestry groups: East Asian majority (Group 1), Non-European majority (Group 2), and European majority (Group 3), showing significant effect sizes for all groups: (Group 1: OR 1.54, p-value 0.006; Group 2: OR 1.44, p-value: <0.001; Group 3 OR: 1.43, p-value: <0.001). PRS 90% compares with monogenic moderate BC risk genes (PRS90 OR: 1.94; CHEK2 OR: 1.89; ATM OR: 1.99).

Conclusion
PRS 3820 can be accurately used in the Brazilian population. This will allow a more precise BC risk assessment of mutation-negative women in Brazil."

Despite complex multilevel factors impacting maternal mortality and morbidity, there are evidence-based interventions that, when facilitated consistently and properly, are known to improve the health of mothers before, during and after pregnancy. The objective of this project is to test implementation of pre-conception counseling with father involvement in community-based settings to improve cardiovascular health outcomes before and during pregnancy in southeastern United States.
Methods and Analysis: This study has two components: a comprehensive needs and assets assessment and a small-scale pilot study. We will conduct a community informed needs and assets assessment with our diverse stakeholders to identify opportunities and barriers to preconception counseling as well as develop a stakeholder-informed implementation plan. Next, we will use the implementation plan to pilot preconception counseling with father involvement in community-based settings. Finally, we will critically assess the context, identify potential barriers and facilitators, and iteratively adapt the way preconception counseling can be implemented in diverse settings. Results of this research will support future research focused on identifying barriers and opportunities for scalable and sustainable public health approaches to implementing evidence-based strategies that reduce maternal morbidity and mortality amongst vulnerable communities in the southeastern U.S.  
Discussion: Findings will demonstrate that preconception counseling can be implemented in community health settings in the southeastern U.S. Furthermore, this study will build the capacity of community-based organizations in addressing the preconception health of their clients. We plan for this pilot to inform a larger scaled-up clinical trial across community health settings in multiple southeastern states."

No validation has been conducted for the BOADICEA multifactorial breast cancer risk prediction model specifically in BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant (PV) carriers to date. Here, we evaluated the performance of BOADICEA in predicting five-year breast cancer risks in a prospective cohort of BRCA1/2 PV carriers ascertained through clinical genetic centres.
Methods
We evaluated the model calibration and discriminatory ability in the prospective TRANsIBCCS cohort study comprising 1,614 BRCA1 and 1,365 BRCA2 PV carriers (209 incident cases). Study participants had lifestyle, reproductive, hormonal, anthropometric risk factor information, a polygenic risk score based on 313 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and family history information.  
Results
The full multifactorial model considering family history together with all other risk factors was well calibrated overall (E/O=1.07, 95%CI:0.92-1.24) and in quintiles of predicted risk. Discrimination was maximized when all risk factors were considered (Harrell's C-index=0.70, 95%CI:0.67-0.74; AUC=0.79, 95%CI:0.76-0.82). The model performance was similar when evaluated separately in BRCA1 or BRCA2 PV carriers. The full model identified 5.8%, 12.9% and 24.0% of BRCA1/2 PV carriers with five-year breast cancer risks of <1.65%, <3% and <5% respectively, risk thresholds commonly used for different management and risk-reduction options. 
Conclusion
BOADICEA may be used to aid personalised cancer risk management and decision making for BRCA1 and BRCA2 PV carriers. It is implemented in the free-access CanRisk tool (www.canrisk.org)."

This study examined the prevalence of African trypanosomiasis within human and animal populations in Nigeria, the trypanosome species involved, the spread of animal reservoirs, and the variability in diagnostic methodologies employed.
Methodology/principal findings: A scoping review was performed, following the methodological framework outlined in PRISMA-ScR checklist. Eligible studies were explored for disease prevalence, causative parasites, reservoir hosts, and diagnostic techniques used. A total of 16 eligible studies published between 1993 and 2021 were retrieved. 13 studies reported the prevalence of African trypanosomiasis in animals, and 3 for humans. Varying prevalence rates were recorded depending on the host population and diagnostic methods employed. The overall prevalence of Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) and Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) was 27.3% (4,404/16,117) and 3.6% (72/1,974) respectively. The highest incidence of HAT was detected using the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT), whereas that of AAT was observed using PCR, followed by microscopy which was the most extensively employed technique in this study. The various diagnostic methods used in various studies showed a variety of sensitivities and specificities, affecting the accuracy of disease detection. Remarkably, domestic animals like cattle, pigs, and dogs were identified as potential reservoirs for the human-infective parasites (T. b. gambiense) in Nigeria.
Conclusion: This study highlights the high prevalence rate and complex epidemiology of African trypanosomiasis in humans and animals in Nigeria. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive measures involving both veterinary and human health sectors to combat African trypanosomiasis effectively in Nigeria. Only few studies have investigated the prevalence of HAT in Nigeria. Hence, adequately coordinated epidemiological surveys are imperative to ascertain the true epidemiological status of HAT in Nigeria and inform targeted intervention policies to achieve WHO’s NTD elimination targets in 2030."

By evaluating plasma of 50 healthy volunteers and 1000 trauma patients across five trauma centers in the United States, we identified 6 novel changes in immune proteins after traumatic injury and further new variations by sex, age, trauma type, comorbidities, as well as a new biomarker predictor of patient survival. Blood was collected at the time of arrival at Level 1 trauma centers and patients were stratified based on trauma level, tissues injured, and injury types. Trauma patients had significantly upregulated proteins associated with immune activation (IL-23, MIP-5), immunosuppression (IL-10) and pleiotropic cytokines (IL-29, IL-6). A high ratio of IL-29 to IL-10 was identified as a new predictor of survival with ROC area of 0.933. Using machine learning, we identified three increased proteins (MIF, TRAIL, IL-29) and three decreased proteins (IL-7, TPO, IL-8) that were the most important in distinguishing a trauma blood profile from those of healthy controls. Biologic sex altered phenotype with IL-8 and MIF being lower in healthy women, but higher in female trauma patients when compared to male counterparts. This work identifies new responses to injury that may influence systemic immune dysfunction, serving as targets for therapeutics and immediate clinical benefit in identifying at-risk patients."

In silico tools, which have been developed to help classify these variants, exhibit variations in outcome. This study aims to  evaluate the performance of 6 widely-used in silico tools in predicting the pathogenicity of drug-actionable gene variants in 9 solid cancers. 

We selected drug-actionable genes according to NCCN guidelines on breast, ovarian, colorectal, melanoma of skin, thyroid, bladder, pancreatic, prostate, and biliary cancer. From these genes, we gathered information on 1161 total missense variants (pathogenic = 606, benign = 555). Pathogenicity of each variant was determined based on assertions from three databases: ClinVar, OncoKB, and My Cancer Genome. We selected variants with one or more concordant databases and excluded variants with conflicting classifications. The performance of the in silico tools (Align-GVGD, CADD, FATHMM, MutationTaster2021, Polyphen-2 (HumDiv), and Polyphen-2 (HumVar)) was evaluated by calculating and comparing their overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).

Overall, all of the in silico tools demonstrated high sensitivity (0.738-0.927) and moderately-high accuracy (0.555-0.829). Excluding MutationTaster2021, all tools demonstrated low specificity (0.242-0.559) and MCC (0.107-0.413). MutationTaster2021 exhibited the highest performance overall and across solid cancer types. Conversely, Align-GVGD exhibited low performance overall and across cancer types. 

Tools demonstrating high sensitivity (CADD: 0.983, MutationTaster2021: 0.927, REVEL: 0.851) could be used to rule out the pathogenic variants. MutationTaster2021, with a comparatively high specificity (0.721), could be considered as an additional test to rule in the pathogenic variants. However, given the varying performance and limitations of the tools according to solid cancer type, clinicians should remain cautious in their usage."

It is fraught with some ethical challenges, often under-explored in African settings. This communication presents a qualitative analysis of ethical issues encountered by caregivers and their patients who are receiving end-of-life care in a teaching hospital in Nigeria. 
Methods: Ethical issues in EOL care encountered by 40 people (dying patients, their families, nurses, and doctors) at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu (UNTH-E) Enugu State, Nigeria was explored over two months. The Participants socio-demographic data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, while qualitative data was analyzed using a thematic framework. The coding of transcripts was done with NVivo 12 software.
Results: All participant groups encountered commonly reported ethical challenges in end-of-life (EOL) care, including issues of medical futility, treatment refusal, truthful disclosures, families requesting that a competent patient not be informed about their condition, confidentiality, limiting or withdrawing a treatment, limited or insufficient pain management, conflicting interests in care, an unfair financial burden without the patient consent, and an unfair burden on the healthcare system. Additionally, the uncommon issues included the patient unwillingness to discussions about their terminal status; families withdrawing due care and support prematurely, and delayed referrals.
Conclusion: Ethical issues are commonly encountered in caring for the patient at EOL in the Nigerian environment notwithstanding the paucity of literature on them. This underscores the importance of adopting known preventive measures to eliminate or minimize these issues."

Each cohort has been created to investigate and develop a deeper understanding of the lived experience of the burdensomeness of multimorbidity by identifying new clusters of burdensomeness indicators, exploring early life risk factors of multimorbidity and modelling hypothetical prevention scenarios.
Participants: The SMC and SMYC are longitudinal e-cohorts created from routinely-collected individual-level population-scale anonymised data sources available within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. They include individuals with available records from linked health and demographic data sources in SAIL at any time between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2022. The SMYC e-cohort is a subset of the SMC, including only individuals born on or after the cohort start date.
Findings to date: The SMC and SMYC cohorts include 5,180,602 (50.3% female and 49.7% male) and 896,155 (48.7% female and 51.3% male) individuals respectively. Considering both primary and secondary care health data, the five most common long-term conditions for individuals in SMC are Depression, affecting 21.6% of the cohort, Anxiety (21.1%), Asthma (17.5%), Hypertension (16.2%) and Atopic Eczema (14.1%), and the five most common conditions for individuals in SMYC are Atopic Eczema (21.2%), Asthma (11.6%), Anxiety (6.0%), Deafness (4.6%) and Depression (4.3%).
Future plans: The SMC and SMYC e-cohorts have been developed using a reproducible, maintainable concept curation pipeline, which allows for the cohorts to be updated dynamically over time and manages for the request and processing of further approved long-term conditions and burdensomeness indicators extraction. Best practices from the MELD-B project can be utilised across other projects, accessing similar data with population-scale data sources and trusted research environments."

Annual screening with a provider has been recommended for groups at highest risk for anal cancer. Anal self-sampling could help address screening barriers, yet no studies have examined annual engagement with this method. 
Methods. The Prevent Anal Cancer Self-Swab Study recruited sexual and gender minority individuals 25 years and over who have sex with men in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to participate in an anal cancer screening study. Participants were randomized to a home or clinic arm. Home-based participants were mailed an anal human papillomavirus self-sampling kit at baseline and 12 months, while clinic-based participants were asked to schedule and attend one of five participating clinics at baseline and 12 months. Using Poisson regression, we conducted an intention-to-treat analysis of 240 randomized participants who were invited to screen at both timepoints. 
Results. 58.8% of participants completed annual (median=370 days) anal screening. When stratified by HIV status, persons living with HIV had a higher proportion of home (71.1%) versus clinic (22.2%) annual screening (p<0.001). Non-Hispanic Black participants had a higher proportion of home-based annual anal screening engagement (73.1%) compared to annual clinic screening engagement (31.6%) (p=0.01). Overall, annual screening engagement was significantly higher among participants who had heard of anal cancer from an LGBTQ organization, reported some prior anal cancer knowledge, preferred an insertive anal sex position, and reported a prior cancer diagnosis. Annual screening engagement was significantly lower for participants reporting a medical condition.
Conclusions. Annual screening engagement among those at disproportionate anal cancer risk was higher in the home arm."

A European child-specific NT1 incidence peak was additionally observed in 2013 post the H1N1 pandemic. Thus, the relationship between NT1 and influenza infection remains unclear. Whether other influenza viruses may also trigger NT1 or other central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH), is unknown. This study investigated annual European incidence patterns of all CDH in complete samples from multiple European centers, in relation to the severity of individual flu strains in preceding influenza seasons.

Methods - Incidence rates of NT1 (N=981) and the combined group of narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) (N=545) from eight European countries were temporally analysed to identify possible incidence peaks from 1995 to 2019. Linear mixed models and spearman correlations were conducted between hypersomnolence disorder incidence rates and the number of influenza infections of preceding influenza season, split for types A H1N1 and H3N2, and in the Netherlands also types B Victoria and Yamagata influenza.

Results - 2010 and 2013 incidence peaks were present in NT1, and a 2010 children peak was unexpectedly found in the combined group of NT2 and IH. Both hypersomnolence groups exhibited a significantly positive relationship with preceding H1N1 influenza season severity and a negative relationship with H3N2 influenza. NT1 was additionally significantly positively correlated with influenza type B Victoria in the Netherlands and showed highest correlation in children.

Conclusions - Besides H1N1 influenza, the temporal association and severity correlation  suggest that influenza type B Victoria may be a novel potential trigger for NT1 that requires further investigation. We additionally provide insights into possible immune-related pathophysiologies of NT2 and IH associated with the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Further immunological investigations are warranted to unravel the complexities of these relationships and their implications for CDH."

Deviations from normal avalanche behavior have been hypothesized to underlie various neurological disorders, particularly schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder associated with altered perception, cognition, and behavior, and recent theories suggest that disruptions in the brain's critical dynamics may contribute to its pathophysiology. In this study, we present a computational model to investigate the properties of normal and imbalanced neural avalanches, with a focus on understanding the potential role of criticality in schizophrenia. We generate avalanche sizes using the Pareto distribution with a power law exponent of -3/2, which is consistent with experimental observations. The model incorporates increasing avalanche sizes over time to simulate the growth of neural activity. We introduce imbalance by adding lateness or earliness to the avalanche sizes, mimicking the potential disruptions in critical dynamics that may occur in schizophrenia. The mean and standard deviation of avalanche sizes are calculated to characterize the normal and imbalanced behavior. The results are visualized using line plots, with shaded areas representing the standard deviation range. Our model provides a framework for understanding the differences between normal and imbalanced neural avalanches, offering insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the altered critical dynamics in schizophrenia. By exploring the relationship between neural avalanches and schizophrenia, this study contributes to the ongoing efforts to elucidate the neurobiological basis of this disorder and may inform future research on potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic interventions targeting the brain's critical dynamics."

We sought to evaluate in-hospital and post-operative opioid usage in patients with different disease severities and treatments for lower extremity vascular disease.
Methods: A retrospective review was performed for all hospital encounters for patients with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code consistent with lower extremity arterial disease admitted to single center between January 2018 and March 2023. Encounters were subdivided according to patient's disease severity, treatment type as designated by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code and comorbid diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. These groups were analyzed for in-hospital opioid use frequency and dosage. Encounters for patients admitted with a secondary diagnosis of lower extremity atherosclerotic disease were included as the control group (CON). A total of 438 patients represented by all the analyzed encounters were then reviewed for number and type of vascular procedures performed as well as opioid use in the outpatient setting for one year.
Results: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) encounters were more likely to use opioids as compared CON and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) without rest pain, ulcer or gangrene groups (CLI 67.9% versus CON 52.1%, p < 0.001 and CLI 67.9% versus PAD 50.2%, p < 0.001). Opioid use was also more common in encounters for gangrene and groups treated with revascularization (REVASC) and amputation (AMP) as compared to CON (gangrene 74.5% versus CON 52.1%, p < 0.01; REVASC 58.3% versus CON 52.1%, p =0.01; and AMP 72.3% versus CON 52.1%, p < 0.01). Significantly increased opioid doses per day (MME/day) were not noted for any of the investigated groups as compared to CON. In the outpatient setting, 186 (42.5%) patients were using opioids one month after the most recent vascular intervention. By one year, 31 (7.1%) patients were still using opioids. No differences in opioid usage were noted for patients undergoing single versus multiple vascular interventions at one year. Patients undergoing certain vascular surgery procedures were more likely to be using opioids at one year.
Conclusion: Patients with CLI and gangrene as well as those undergoing vascular treatment have a greater frequency of opioid use during hospital encounters as compared those patients with less severe disease and undergoing conservative management, respectively. However, these findings do not equate to higher doses of opioid used during hospitalization. Patients undergoing multiple vascular procedures are not more likely to be using opioid long-term (at one year) as compared to those patients treated with single vascular procedures."

Detecting AF, especially paroxysmal AF, presents challenges, highlighting the necessity for continuous Holter monitoring. In our investigation, we utilized commercial data archives to examine AF prevalence and associated cardiac arrhythmias among stroke patients and controls. We also analyzed various factors, such as age, gender, symptoms, test duration, and duration post-stroke, to identify predictors of arrhythmias and enhance paroxysmal detection rates. We included 98 stroke patients and 98 controls for comparing AF prevalence within 72 hours post-stroke and analyzed 779 stroke patients within 4 days to 10 weeks post-stroke. Our findings revealed a higher AF detection rate in stroke patients compared to controls, with AF being the most prevalent arrhythmia observed. Older age and symptom presence were associated with significant findings, particularly AF. Temporal analysis showed a negative correlation between AF and complete heart block occurrence over time, while ventricular tachycardia exhibited a positive correlation. Paroxysmal fibrillation detection rates were highest within the initial month, with the optimal duration of Holter monitoring being 10 days, underscoring the importance of extended monitoring for detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation could influence stroke management. Furthermore, our study suggests the potential utility of commercial data in yielding comparable outcomes to research data."

There are only a few long-term PCV impact assessments in sub-Saharan Africa, and these have been confined to settings using a 13-valent PCV. A 10-valent PCV was introduced in Kenya in 2011 with catchup vaccination among children aged <5 years in Kilifi. We evaluated the impact of PCV10 introduction in Kilifi through 2022.
Methods
Surveillance for IPD among residents of the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System was conducted at the Kilifi County Referral Hospital. Identification of pneumococcus isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid and pneumococcal serotyping were conducted according to WHO recommendations. Age- and serotype-specific incidence rate ratios, adjusted for pre-defined confounders (aIRRs), were used to compare annual IPD incidence in the pre-vaccine period to that in 2017-2019 (late post-vaccine) and 2020-2022 (COVID-19). 
Findings
Compared to the pre-vaccine period, the incidence of vaccine serotype (VT) IPD among children aged <5 years was significantly lower in 2017-2019 (aIRR 0.14; 95%CI 0.04-0.49) and in 2020-2022 (aIRR 0.03; 95%CI 0.00-0.25). It also declined among older children and adults. The incidence of non-VT (NVT) IPD among children aged <15 years was higher during the post-vaccine period. All serotype IPD incidence declined across all age groups. Among individuals with NVT-IPD, serotypes included in new-generation PCVs accounted for about one-third and about one-half of disease among individuals aged <5 years and ≥5 years, respectively.  
Interpretation 
Despite potential waning of the effects of catchup vaccination during introduction, reductions in VT-IPD incidence were sustained through 12 years of PCV10 use. All serotype IPD incidence declined across all ages despite serotype replacement among children. New-generation PCVs may enhance IPD control."

Collaborative efforts across disciplines are essential for effective AI-governance; unaddressed differences in disciplinary perspectives and priorities risks impeding effective reform. 
 
Objective: To provide law and policymaking guidance by systematically mapping the legal concerns about health-AI raised by disciplines of medicine, law, nursing, pharmacy, other healthcare professions, public health, computer science, and engineering, revealing convergences and divergences in disciplinary comprehension, prioritization, and proposed solutions to legal issues.

Design, data sources, and study selection: Employing a scoping review methodology, we searched MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), HeinOnline Law Journal Library, Index to Foreign Legal Periodicals (HeinOnline), Index to Legal Periodicals and Books (EBSCOhost), Web of Science (Core Collection), Scopus, and IEEE Xplore, identifying relevant legal issue discussions published, in English or French, from January 2012 to July 2021. Of 18,168 screened studies, 432 were included for data extraction and analysis.

Results: Critical disciplinary differences were evident in both the frequency and nature of discussions of legal issues and potential solutions. Notably, innovators in computer science and engineering exhibited minimal engagement with legal issues. Authors in law and medicine frequently contributed, but prioritized different legal issues and proposed different solutions. 

Conclusion: Discrepancies in perspectives regarding law reform priorities and solutions jeopardize the progress of health-AI development. We need inclusive, interdisciplinary dialogues concerning the risks and trade-offs associated with various solutions to ensure optimal law and policy reform."

Despite large GWAS meta-analyses (N > 750,000), only a few dozen causal loci have been identified. We hypothesized that the challenges in identifying causal genes for endometriosis stem from heterogeneity across clinical and biological factors underlying endometriosis diagnosis. 
Methods: We extracted known endometriosis risk factors, symptoms, and concomitant conditions from the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB) and performed unsupervised spectral clustering on 4,078 women with endometriosis. The 5 clusters were characterized by utilizing additional electronic health record (EHR) variables, such as endometriosis-related comorbidities and confirmed surgical phenotypes. From four EHR-linked genetic datasets, PMBB, eMERGE, AOU, and UKBB, we extracted lead variants and tag variants 39 known endometriosis loci for association testing. We meta-analyzed ancestry-stratified case/control tests for each locus and cluster in addition to a positive control (Total Nendometriosis cases = 10,108). 
Results: We have designated the five subtype clusters as pain comorbidities, uterine disorders, pregnancy complications, cardiometabolic comorbidities, and EHR-asymptomatic based on enriched features from each group. One locus, RNLS, surpassed the genome-wide significant threshold in the positive control. Thirteen more loci reached a Bonferroni threshold of 1.3 x 10-3 (0.05 / 39) in the positive control. The cluster-stratified tests yielded more significant associations than the positive control for anywhere from 5 to 15 loci depending on the cluster. Bonferroni significant loci were identified for four out of five clusters, including WNT4 and GREB1 for the uterine disorders cluster, RNLS for the cardiometabolic cluster, FSHB for the pregnancy complications cluster, and SYNE1 and CDKN2B-AS1 for the EHR-asymptomatic cluster. This study enhances our understanding of the clinical presentation patterns of endometriosis subtypes, showcasing the innovative approach employed to investigate this complex disease."

These investigations are discovering the importance of critical RNAs in cancer progression. Enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) is one of these RNAs that has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in many types of cancer. Up to now, many studies have been conducted to elucidate ceRNA role of EZH2 in cancer. Due to EZH2's dual role as an oncogene and tumor suppressor in cancer, a more thorough exploration of its ceRNA functions may enhance clinical approaches to cancer treatment. In the current scoping review, we searched online databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar to identify experimentally-validated ceRNA axes including EZH2 in human cancers. We identified 62 unique axes consisting of 30 microRNAs (miRNAs), 31 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 9 messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and 14 circular RNAs (circRNAs). Notably, SPRY4-IT1 - miR-101-3p - EZH2 and XIST - miR-101-3p - EZH2 were recurrent axes observed in multiple cancer types. Among the most frequent miRNAs were miR-101-3p, miR-144-3p, and miR-124-3p, and ceRNAs including SPRY4-IT1, XIST, SNHG6, HOXA11-AS, MALAT1, and TUG1 emerged as frequent competitors of EZH2 for miRNA binding. This scoping review highlights the prevalence and diversity of EZH2-containing ceRNA axes in cancer, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets. Future research should delve deeper into these axes to elucidate their functional significance and assess their clinical applicability."

Highlighting the importance of Awareness, medication, and Control of HTN is essential. A significant proportion of hypertensive patients are unaware of their condition, hindering proper and early treatment. Among those diagnosed, not all receive or follow pharmacological treatment, and an even smaller percentage achieves effective blood pressure control.
Objective: The main objectives include determining the prevalence, trends, and associated factors of HTN, as well as investigating prehypertension and the variability in HBP levels during the same period. Special attention will be given to self-reported, medicated, and Controlled hypertension, analyzing its evolution and associated factors.
Methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study using the National Survey of Demographic and Family Health database between 2014 and 2022. Our study included individuals aged 18 years and older, as the definitions of HTN apply to people from this age onwards.
Results: The study revealed an overall HTN, prehypertension, and HBP prevalence of 20.76%, 33.44%, and 33.44%, respectively, with annual variations. An increasing trend in the prevalence of known, medicated, and controlled HTN was observed, with factors such as gender, age, educational level, and geographical region significantly influencing it.
Conclusions: The investigation into HTN in Peru revealed an expanding occurrence of HTN, prehypertension, and HBP, emphasizing the necessity for early identification, suitable treatment, and effective management of HTN. A significant gap is observed between the condition's awareness and effective management, highlighting the urgent need for public health strategies that address both the prevention and treatment of HTN in Peru."

Residential segregation has been identified as drivers of disparities in health outcomes, but further work is needed to understand this association with clinical outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We utilized Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) dataset to examine if there are differences in survival to discharge and survival with good neurological outcome, as well as likelihood of bystander CPR, using validated measures of racial, ethnic, and economic segregation. 

Methods
We conducted a retrospective observational study using data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) dataset to examine associations among adult OHCA patients. The primary predictor was the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE), a validated measure that includes race, ethnicity, and income across three measures at the census tract level. The primary outcomes were survival to discharge and survival with good neurological status. A multivariable modified Poisson regression modeling approach with random effects at the EMS agency and hospital level was utilized. 

Results
We identified 626,264 OHCA patients during the study period. The mean age was 62 years old (SD 17.2 years), and 35.7% (n =223,839) of the patients were female. In multivariable models, we observed an increased likelihood of survival to discharge and survival with good neurological outcome for those patients residing in predominately White population census tracts and higher income census tracts as compared to lower income Black and Hispanic/Latinx population census tracts (RR 1.24, CI 1.20-1.28) and a 32% increased likelihood of receiving bystander CPR in higher income census tracts as compared to reference (RR 1.32, CI 1.30-1.34).

Conclusions
In this study examining the association of measures of residential segregation and OHCA outcomes, there was an increased likelihood of survival to discharge, survival with good neurological status, and likelihood of receiving B-CPR for those patients residing in predominately White population and higher income census tracts when compared to predominately Black and/or Hispanic Latinx populations and lower income census tracts. This research suggests that areas impacted by residential and economic segregation are important targets for both public policy interventions as well as addressing disparities in care across the chain of survival for OHCA."

The potential impact of CMD on the conduction system and occurrence of arrhythmias has received limited attention. This study aimed to examine the link between CMD and surface electrocardiography (ECG). 

METHODS: We harnessed the Coronary Microvascular Disease registry (CMDR), utilizing the CoroVentis CoroFlow System (Abbott) to invasively assess patients presenting with symptomatic chest pain. All patients underwent microvascular assessment of the left anterior descending artery territory. Our cohort was stratified into two groups, CMD-positive and CMD-negative, with an analysis of the most recent ECG performed prior to the invasive evaluation for each patient.
 
RESULTS: Our cohort comprised 230 patients, of which 60 were classified as CMD-positive and 170 as CMD-negative. T-wave inversion was observed in 30.5% of CMD-positive patients compared to 20% in the CMD-negative group (P=0.09), and ST depression was identified in 6.7% of CMD-positive patients compared to 2.4% of CMD-negative patients (P=0.12). There were no differences in conduction disorders, such as left bundle branch block (LBBB), left anterior hemiblock (LAHB), left posterior hemiblock (LPHB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), incomplete right bundle branch block (ICRBBB), and bifascicular block, between the two groups. There were no discernible distinctions in the ECG intervals, including the PR, QRS, and QT. There was a trend of increased left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) according to the ECG criteria in patients with CMD (11.7% vs. 5.3%; P=0.09). 

CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a tendency toward ischemic and hypertrophic ECG changes among CMD-positive patients, but no differences in the occurrence of conduction disorders in patients with and without CMD.

The objective of this study was to evaluate different machine learning approaches for detection of SBDH from the unstructured clinical notes in the EHR.  

Methods: Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) was applied to 2,083,180 clinical notes corresponding to 46,146 patients in the MIMIC-III dataset. Using LSI, patients were ranked based on conceptual relevance to a set of keywords (lexicons) pertaining to 15 different SBDH categories. For Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models, API requests were made with a Python script to connect to the OpenAI services in Azure, using gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 and gpt-4-1106-preview models. Prediction of SBDH categories were performed using logistic regression model that included age, gender race and SBDH ICD-9 codes with a natural cubic spline of 2 degrees of freedom for age.

Results: LSI retrieved patients according to 15 SBDH domains, with an overall average PPV ≥ 83%. Using manually curated gold standard (GS) sets for nine SBDH categories, the macro-F1 score of LSI (0.74) was better than ICD-9 (0.71) and GPT-3.5 (0.54), but lower than GPT-4 (0.80). Due to document size limitations, only a subset of the GS cases could be processed by GPT-3.5 (55.8%) and GPT-4 (94.2%), compared to LSI (100%). Using common GS subsets for nine different SBDH categories, the macro-F1 of ICD-9 combined with either LSI (mean 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.93), GPT-3.5 (0.86, 0.82-0.91) or GPT-4 (0.88, 0.83-0.94) was not significantly different. After including age, gender, race and ICD-9 in a logistic regression model, the AUC for prediction of six out of the nine SBDH categories was higher for LSI compared to GPT-4.0. 

Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the LSI approach performs comparable to more recent large language models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0, when using the same set of documents. Importantly, LSI is robust, deterministic, and does not have document-size limitations or cost implications, which make it more amenable to real-world applications in health systems."

The Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score is a valuable tool for assessing patient functionality and contributes to the stratification of patients with poor prognoses. This study aimed to develop a 6-month postoperative Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) prediction model by combining clinical data with deep learning-based image features from pre- and postoperative MRI scans, offering enhanced personalized care for glioblastoma patients.
Materials and Methods: Using 1,476 MRI datasets from the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2020 public database, we pretrained two variational autoencoders (VAEs). Imaging features from the latent spaces of the VAEs were used for KPS prediction. Neural network-based KPS prediction models were developed to predict scores below 70 at 6 months postoperatively. In this retrospective single-center analysis, we incorporated clinical parameters and pre- and postoperative MRI images from 150 newly diagnosed IDH wild-type glioblastoma, divided into training (100 patients) and test (50 patients) sets. In training set, the performance of these models was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), calculated through fivefold cross-validation repeated 10 times. The performance of these models in the training set was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) from a fivefold cross-validation repeated 10 times. The final evaluation of the developed models assessed in the test set.
Results: Among the 150 patients, 61 had 6-month postoperative KPS scores below 70 and 89 scored 70 or higher. We developed three models: a clinical-based model, an MRI-based model, and a multimodal model that incorporated both clinical parameters and MRI features. In the training set, the mean AUC was 0.785±0.051 for the multimodal model, which was significantly higher than the clinical-based model (0.716±0.059, P=0.038) using only clinical parameters and MRI-based model (0.651±0.028, P<0.001) using only MRI features. In the test set, the multimodal model achieved an AUC of 0.810, outperforming the clinical-based (0.670) and MRI-based (0.650) models.
Conclusion: The integration of MRI features extracted from VAEs with clinical parameters in the multimodal model substantially enhanced KPS prediction performance. This approach has the potential to improve prognostic prediction, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatments for patients with glioblastoma.

In this study, we hypothesize that the National Health Insurance (NHI) claims data can be used to classify pregnant women into several obstetric groups. This study aims to examine the use of NHI claims database for analyzing CS according to the WHO manual for Robson classification. This study is a cross-sectional analysis using delivery claims from NHI sample set data from 2017 to 2018. We categorized the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 codes in the claims data according to the Robson classification system using the following variables: multiple pregnancy, fetal presentation, previous obstetric record, previous CS record, gestational age, and onset of labor. Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics. A total of 31,375 deliveries were included in the analysis. Overall, mean age of mothers was 29.2±5.9 years. The CS rate in this population was 37.0% in 2017 and 38.7% in 2018. Highest CS rate was found in nulliparous (group 2: 26.6%) and multiparous women (group 4: 24.8%) if labour induced or had prelabour CS, followed by multiparous women with previous uterine scar (group 5: 22.5%). We found an alarmingly high rate of CS among Indonesian women. Implementation of Robson classification in the National Health Insurance claims data is feasible and should be considered by the policy makers as an audit tool to identify the groups that contributes the most to the CS rate."

This study aimed to evaluate antiretroviral therapy retention, adherence, and viral suppression among postpartum women in Nigeria. This retrospective clinical data analysis included women with a delivery record at the antenatal HIV clinic at Jos University Teaching Hospital between 2013 and 2017. Descriptive statistics quantified proportions retained, adherent (≥95% medication possession ratio), and virally suppressed up to 24 months postpartum. Among 1535 included women, 1497 met the triple antiretroviral therapy eligibility criteria. At 24 months, 1342 (89.6%) women remained in care, 51 (3.4%) reported transferring, and 104 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up. The proportion of patients with ≥95% medication possession ratio decreased from 79.0% to 69.1% over the 24 months. Viral suppression among those with results was 88.7% at 24 months, but <62% of those retained had viral load results at each time point. In multiple logistic regression, predictors of loss to follow-up included having a more recent HIV diagnosis, higher gravidity, fewer antenatal care visits, and a non-hospital delivery. Predictors of viral non-suppression included poorer adherence, unsuppressed/missing baseline viral load, lower baseline CD4+ T-cell count, and higher gravidity. Loss to follow-up rates were lower and antiretroviral therapy adherence rates similar among postpartum women at our study hospital compared with other sub-Saharan countries. Longer follow-up time and inclusion of multiple facilities for a nationally representative sample would be beneficial in future studies."

We study whether social preferences—concerns for the well-being of other people—are associated with one's decision regarding vaccination. We measure these social preferences for 549 online subjects with a public-good game and an altruism game. To the extent that one gets vaccinated out of concern for the health of others, contribution in the public-good game is analogous to an individual's decision to obtain vaccination, while our altruism game provides a different measure of altruism, equity, and efficiency concerns. We proxy vaccine demand with how quickly a representative individual voluntarily took the initial vaccination for COVID-19 (after the vaccine was widely available). We collect COVID-19 vaccination history separately from the games to avoid experimenter-demand effects. We find a strong result: Contribution in the public-good game is associated with greater demand to voluntarily receive a first dose, and thus also to vaccinate earlier. Compared to a subject who contributes nothing, one who contributes the maximum ($4) is 58% more likely to obtain a first dose voluntarily in the four-month period that we study (April through August 2021). In short, people who are more pro-social are more likely to take a voluntary COVID-19 vaccination. Behavior in our altruism game does not predict vaccination. We recommend further research on the use of pro-social preferences to help motivate individuals to vaccinate for other transmissible diseases, such as the flu and HPV."

The incidence of common arterial thrombotic events (mainly acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke) was generally lower after each vaccine dose, brand and combination. Similarly, the incidence of common venous thrombotic events, (mainly pulmonary embolism and lower limb deep venous thrombosis) was lower after vaccination. There was a higher incidence of previously reported rare harms after vaccination: vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia after first ChAdOx1 vaccination, and myocarditis and pericarditis after first, second and transiently after booster mRNA vaccination (BNT-162b2 and mRNA-1273). These findings support the wide uptake of future COVID-19 vaccination programs."

Both simulation and real studies showed that SR-TWAS improved power due to increased effective training sample sizes and borrowed strength across multiple regression methods and tissues. Leveraging base models across multiple reference panels, tissues, and regression methods, our studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and Parkinson's disease (PD) identified respective 11 independent significant risk genes for AD (supplementary motor area tissue) and 12 independent significant risk genes for PD (substantia nigra tissue), including 6 novels for AD and 6 novels for PD."

Smartphone addiction is a growing social problem especially in young mobile users. This study investigated indicators of smartphone use, smartphone addiction, and their associations with demographic and behavior-related variables in young people.
Methods
460 participants were secondary school students (Mage=17,10, SDage=0.92, 51.1% males, 52.4% high school students), took part in an anonymous questionnaire consisting of the following elements: the Mobile Phone Addiction Assessment Questionnaire (KBUTK), original questions regarding problematic smartphones usage, along with a subjective assessment of the use of such devices. Logistic regression model using forward stepwise method was used to characterize a typical smartphone user. Smartphone addiction was measured using KBUTK. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with smartphone addiction.
Results
A total of 460 participants admitted to using a smartphone. Gender, age, type of school, place of living influenced the ways respondents used their smartphones. Being female (OR = 5.80; p < 0.0001), sixteen-year-old (OR = 0,41; p = 0.0456), and student of technical school (OR = 2.66; p = 0.0025) turned out to be the characteristics of a typical smartphone user. 21.7% of adolescents considered themselves addicted to smartphones, 22.2% admitted that they had problems with face-to-face relationships and girls significantly more often than boys (61.8% vs.  51.5%) neglected home or school duties as a result of using a smartphone. The overall rate of smartphone addiction was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) among girls (2.31 pts) than boys (2.03 pts), and correlated positively with the perception of being a smartphone addict (rho = 0.223; p < 0.0001). Addiction to smartphones was also significantly more common among students of technical schools, and respondents living in blocks of flats.
Conclusions
The way adolescents used smartphones differed depending on gender, age and type of school. Interventions for reducing the negative effects of smartphone use should take into account these context, as well as education both adolescents and their parents."

Lifestyle modification has been shown to improve blood pressure (BP) control, but its practice is poor among patients with hypertension. Thus, measures that would help patients with hypertension achieve positive lifestyle modification would improve BP control. The study aimed to determine the effect of motivational interviewing on lifestyle modification and blood pressure control among patients with hypertension attending the Family Medicine Clinics of Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH), Irrua, Nigeria.

Methods

The study was a randomised control trial (PACTR202301917477205) of 250 hypertensive adults between 18 and 65 years presenting to the Family Medicine Clinics of ISTH randomised into intervention and control groups. Those in the intervention group were given monthly motivational interviewing (MI) on lifestyle modification in addition to standard care for the management of hypertension while those in the control group got standard care only for 6 months. Both groups were assessed at baseline and 6 months. Data was analysed with Stata version 17 (StataCorp LLC) with level of significance at 0.05. Primary outcome was lifestyle modification while secondary outcome was BP control both at 6 months.

Results

The age of the participants ranged from 24 to 65 years with a mean age of 51.5 ± 10.0 years. The blood pressure control at baseline was 24%. At the end of the six-month study, there was a statistically significant improvement in the lifestyle pattern of the intervention group compared to control except smoking in which the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.150). Blood pressure control significantly improved from 24% at baseline to 48% post-intervention (p=0.014).

Conclusion

The study found a significant positive association between motivational interviewing and lifestyle modification. The study also found a significant improvement in blood pressure control following motivational interviewing. There is a need to incorporate motivational interviewing into the management of hypertension for better outcomes."

Echocardiography is the most common modality for assessing cardiac structure and function. While cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is less accessible, CMR can provide unique tissue characterization including late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), T1 and T2 mapping, and extracellular volume (ECV) which are associated with tissue fibrosis, infiltration, and inflammation. While deep learning has been shown to uncover findings not recognized by clinicians, it is unknown whether CMR-based tissue characteristics can be derived from echocardiography videos using deep learning. We hypothesized that deep learning applied to echocardiography could predict CMR-based measurements. 

Methods
In a retrospective single-center study, adult patients with CMRs and echocardiography studies within 30 days were included. A video-based convolutional neural network was trained on echocardiography videos to predict CMR-derived labels including wall motion abnormality (WMA) presence, LGE presence, and abnormal T1, T2 or ECV across echocardiography views. The model performance was evaluated in a held-out test dataset not used for training.

Results
The study population included 1,453 adult patients (mean age 56±18 years, 42% female) with 2,556 paired echocardiography studies occurring on average 2 days after CMR (interquartile range 2 days prior to 6 days after). The model had high predictive capability for presence of WMA (AUC 0.873 [95%CI 0.816-0.922]), however, the model was unable to reliably detect the presence of LGE (AUC 0.699 [0.613-0.780]), native T1 (AUC 0.614 [0.500-0.715]), T2 0.553 [0.420-0.692], or ECV 0.564 [0.455-0.691]).

Conclusions
Deep learning applied to echocardiography accurately identified CMR-based WMA, but was unable to predict tissue characteristics, suggesting that signal for these tissue characteristics may not be present within ultrasound videos, and that the use of CMR for tissue characterization remains essential within cardiology."

To investigate the acceptance rate for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) carrier screening among Thai pregnant women, their attitudes toward the prenatal screening, carrier rate, and the frequencies of SMN2 copy numbers.
Materials and methods. Singleton pregnant women who aged ≥18 years, with a gestational age of ≤14 weeks at their first visit, were invited to participate the study. All participants completed the questionnaire: Section I - demographic data. Then, they received a pre-test group counseling, followed by an offer of SMA carrier testing at no cost and completion of the questionnaire: Section II - awareness and attitudes toward the screening and Section III – reasons for their choosing ‘to have’ or ‘not to have’ the screening done. Only those having the test done and undergoing post-test counseling were asked to complete the questionnaire: Section IV – attitudes toward the screening process.
Results. We found a high acceptance rate for carrier screening at 91.4% (181/198 participants), a carrier rate of 2.2% (1 in 45), and high frequency of ≤2 copies of SMN2 (98.3%). The preexisting knowledge about SMA was low (30.8%). The majority of participants became realized about the severity of SMA and its burden to the families (94.4%) and agreed to have fetal diagnosis if they were found to be a couple-at-risk (92.4%). Most participants (98%) suggested that SMA carrier screening should be offered to all pregnant women and that the cost of testing should be covered by the government and/or by their health coverage schemes (95.5%).
Conclusion. The high acceptance rate and positive attitude toward prenatal SMA carrier was demonstrated among Thai pregnant women. Data from the present study highlight urgent needs for endorsement from professional society and public health policy in advancing the SMA carrier screening program in Thailand."

Correlations between peak exercise performance and progression of RV remodeling in rTOF remain elusive.
Methods: Patients with rTOF were reviewed with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Peak and submaximal CPET parameters were obtained. Both RV and left ventricular (LV) volume were measured in end-systole (RVESV and LVESV, respectively) and end-diastole (LVEDV and RVEDV, respectively). Stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), and pulmonary regurgitant fraction (RF) were calculated. 
Results: Thirty-seven patients (17 ± 5 years; 22 females; 5 with pulmonary atresia and 2 with absent pulmonary valve) were studied. Pulmonary RF was 28.3 ± 13.4%. Indexed RVEDV was 132 ± 33 mL/m2. Ejection fraction of RV and LV was 50.3 ± 7.8% and 59.1 ± 6.1%, respectively. Peak oxygen consumption (pVO2) was 71 ± 16% of predicted maximum value. A strong positive correlation was noted between CMR data including RVEDV, RVSV and LVSV, and pVO2. Higher RVEDV was correlated with higher RVSV and LVSV and higher pVO2, whereas lower RVEDV was associated with lower RVSV and LVSV and lower pVO2.
Conclusion: In rTOF, smaller RV resulted in reduced SV of both ventricles and significantly lower pVO2, whereas larger RV provided higher SV and higher pVO2 regardless of RVEF or RF. Smaller RV in rTOF may represent a unique pathological entity responsible for reduced exercise performance, which requires special consideration when determining further surgical interventions."

There are no known objective biomarkers for predicting Return to Work (RTW) in ischemic stroke survivors. This study aims to explore the predictive utility and define a cut-off value of lesion volume on RTW after endovascular treatment (EVT).
 
Methods:
We included patients <65 years undergoing EVT at Oslo University Hospital (OUS) between January 2017 and May 2019. Employment status was obtained at both baseline and a four-year follow-up. Stroke lesion volumes were segmented using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans 24 hours post EVT. Logistic regression models were conducted to assess the impact of lesion volume on RTW-status at follow-up, adjusted for patients? characteristics, stroke related factors and treatment. We calculated the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve to determine the optimal lesion volume cut-off. Machine learning (ML) regression models were employed to assess the predictive abilities of baseline clinical and imaging variables for RTW.
 
Results:
Of the 109 individuals treated, 81 (74%) were employed at baseline. Among these, 60 completed four-year follow-up with MRI available for stroke lesion segmentation and were included in the analyses. Mean age at stroke onset was 51.8 years (range 23.5?64.9), 50% were female. Median lesion volume was 18 ml (IQR 45-7). After four years, 34 (57%) had successfully RTW. The odds for not RTW increased by 5% for every 1 ml increase in lesion volume (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 95% CI, 1.02?1.11], P=0.02). A lesion volume cut-off value of 29 cm3 yielded a sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.65 for predicting RTW. Notably, the most influential feature in the ML model for predicting RTW was lesion volume.

Conclusion:
Lesion volume was the most robust predictor of RTW four years after EVT. Our findings suggest that a cut-off of 29 cm3 is suitable to distinguish between those with high and low chance of RTW."

Objective: To evaluate the long-term outcomes of RFCA in patients with LSP-AF lasting ≥ 3 years, and to identify predictors for AF recurrence.
Methods: This retrospective study included 151 patients with LSP-AF undergoing first-time RFCA. Procedure was performed with wide antral pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) based individualized ablation strategy, guided by ablation index (AI). Patients were followed up for ? 18 months, and recurrence predictors were determined.
Results: Enrolled patients (mean persistent AF duration: 7.6 ± 5.2 years) had a mean age of 65.3 ± 9.2 years and the median left atrial diameter (LAD) was 45.0 (42.0-49.0) mm. PVI was achieved in all, followed by modified left posterior wall isolation (PWI) in 147 patients. Additional ablation after PWI was performed in 88 patients. During the 18-month follow-up, the overall success rate was 74.2%. Multivariate analysis identified AF duration (HR 1.078; 95% CI 1.020-1.139; P = 0.007), LAD (HR 1.069; 95% CI 1.010-1.132; P = 0.022), and pre-procedure CRP (HR 1.063; 95% CI 1.010-1.117; P = 0.018) as independent predictors of AF recurrence. Among patients with PVI and PWI, those without empirical additional ablation (EAA) had a lower but not statistically significant recurrence rate (18.6%) than those with EAA (31.8%, P = 0.076).
Conclusion: Among LSP-AF patients, the long-term efficacy of AI-guided RFCA is acceptable, especially in selected patients. However, EAA after PVI and PWI may be unhelpful."

The occurrence of PI is closely related to emotional disorders, social stress and environmental stress. According to current studies, acupuncture offers significant advantages in treating PI. The manual acupuncture has been used for the treatment of insomnia for decades. Different acupuncture strategies, including electroacupuncture, manual acupuncture, and multiple acupuncture, have been reported to treat insomnia. However, there are few standardized clinical reports to investigate the effect of the manual acupuncture and its mechanism.
Methods: This study was a parallel, randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the clinical efficacy of the manual acupuncture in treating PI, and to clarify the mechanism. The study included a 4-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up period. All eligible 74 patients diagnosed with PI will be evaluated using scales before treatment, and then be randomly assigned to the acupuncture group and the placebo acupuncture group at a ratio of 1:1. Both groups choose the same acupoints. The patients will be evaluated at 4 weeks before treatment, after 4 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks after treatment respectively. The patients in the acupuncture group were treated with manual acupuncture and placebo acupuncture group received the tube of Park sham devices. All 12 sessions of treatment will last over 4 weeks (3 sessions per week). The main outcome measure will be the change in Pittsburgh sleep quality index  before and after treatment, and the secondary outcome measures include Chalder-14 fatigue scale, Epworth sleepiness scale, self-rating depression scale, self-rating anxiety scale, polysomnography and heart rate variability.
Discussion: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the manual acupuncture, and the results will provide a scientific theoretical basis for the clinical promotion.

The intricate relationship between AF and stroke necessitates careful consideration in the timing of anticoagulant therapy initiation to prevent stroke recurrence, hemorrhagic transformation, and other complications.
Aim: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early versus late initiation of anticoagulant treatment in patients with AF after an ischemic stroke, addressing the critical gap in optimal timing to balance the risk of recurrent stroke against bleeding risks.
Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA-2020 guidelines, with searches performed across multiple databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane. Randomized controlled trials comparing early versus later initiation of anticoagulation in AF patients post-stroke were included. Data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model, considering recurrent ischemic stroke, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and mortality as primary outcomes.
Results: From 1444 identified records, three studies and 2989 patients were included, comprising a diverse population in terms of geography and demographics. Meta-analysis revealed that early anticoagulation initiation might be associated with a reduced risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (RR 0.72, 95% CI [0.51-1.00])(p=0.05), although statistical significance was borderline. No significant differences were found in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or mortality rates between early and late initiation. Early intervention was, however, associated with a reduction in other adverse outcomes (RR 0.72, 95% CI [0.54-0.96])(p=0.03).
Conclusions: Early initiation of anticoagulation therapy in AF patients post-ischemic stroke may offer a protective effect against recurrent ischemic events with no significant increase in bleeding or mortality risks. This suggests that early anticoagulation can be safely considered, particularly in light of reducing other adverse outcomes.

Here, we evaluated the effect of differential blood pressure (BP) levels on future ESRD in this population.
Methods: Using nationwide health check-up data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service between 2015 and 2016, we obtained data for 80,187 patients with T2DM who underwent previous PCI. Patients were classified into four groups according to BP level measured within at least 2 years after PCI: systolic BP <120 (reference), <130, <140, <160, and ≥160 mm Hg; diastolic BP <80 (reference), <90, <100, and ≥100 mm Hg. The primary outcome was incident ESRD, defined as a combination of the relevant disease code and the initiation of renal replacement therapy. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) according to BP group.
Results: The mean age was 67.7 years, and 80.9% of the participants were treated with antihypertensive medication. ESRD occurred in 1,362 (1.70%) patients during the 4.7-year follow-up. After adjustment for confounding factors, the HR of ESRD patients significantly and sequentially increased in the higher BP groups. Similar findings were noted regarding the relationship between incident ESRD and pulse pressure (PP). According to the subgroup analysis, this relationship was more significant for SBP in those aged <65 years than in those who were aged 65 years or older (P for interaction=0.0498). ESRD risk was linearly associated with systolic BP and had a J-shaped association with diastolic BP in patients with baseline values of 70 and 68 mm Hg.
Conclusions: In this nationwide population-based study, elevated systolic and diastolic BP and PP were associated with the risk of developing ESRD in a dose–response manner among T2DM patients who underwent PCI. To prevent ESRD, more strict BP control is needed in T2DM patients who underwent PCI.

This returns to the poor diagnostic and therapeutic strategies including the early prevention methods.
Aims: To assess the changes in the single channel electrocardiography (SCECG) in rest and on exercise test in patients with vs without ischemic heart disease confirmed by stress computed tomography myocardial perfusion (CTP) imaging.
Objectives: Ischemic heart disease patients frequently have preventable risk factors and causes that lead to the disease appearance. However, the lack of the proper diagnostic and prevention tools remains a global challenge in or era despite the current scientific advances. 
Material and methods: A cohort, prospective, single center observational study included 38 participants from Moscow. The participants aged ≥ 40 years and given a written consent to participate in the study. The participants subdivided into two groups according to the presence or absence of the myocardial perfusion defect on the CTP with vasodilatation stress-test. Both groups (group 1 with myocardial perfusion defect (n=19), group 2 without myocardial perfusion defect (n=19)) passed general primary consultation by cardiologist, anthropometric measurements, recording 3-minutes single channel electrocardiography (ECG) in rest before and just after exercise test, blood pressure and pulse rate using automatic tonometer, echocardiography, cardio-ankle vascular index, performing ergometry, immediately repeating the single channel ECG, then performing CTP. LASSO regression with nested cross-validation was used to find association between Cardio-Qvark parameters and the existence of the perfusion defect. Statistical processing was carried out using the R programming language v4.2 and Python v.3.10 [^R].
Results: The study results showed that the single channel ECG have significantly higher diagnostic accuracy in compare to bicycle ergometry. The specificity 63.2 % [95 % confidence interval (CI); 0.391 ; 0.833],  sensitivity 73.7 % [95 % CI ; 0.533 ; 0.929], and accuracy of the diagnostic method using exhaled breath analysis, area under the curve (AUC) 68.4 % [95 % CI ; 0.527 ; 0.817].
Conclusion: Single channel ECG (Cardio-Qvark) has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the bicycle ergometry.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of hormonal contraception on symptom severity and gastric myoelectrical activity in people with chronic gastroduodenal disorders. 
Methods: This analysis was conducted on a large international cohort of patients who met Rome IV criteria for CNVS or FD and had undergone body surface gastric mapping using Gastric Alimetry (Alimetry, New Zealand). Symptoms were continuously reported on 0-10 Likert scales using a validated symptom logging app. 
Results: 127 people were included: 43 females using hormonal contraception, 30 premenopausal females not using hormonal contraception, 30 postmenopausal females, and 24 males. Premenopausal females who used hormonal contraception had higher nausea scores than non-users (3.80 [IQR 2.00-5.42] vs 2.25 [0.20-4.43]; p<0.05), particularly when using the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) with hormone-free intervals compared to continuous use (5.20 [4.30-6.00] vs. 2.40 [1.70-3.80], p=0.02). Premenopausal women were more symptomatic than postmenopausal women and men (p<0.001). The Principal Gastric Frequency was higher in hormonal contraception users (median 3.1 cpm [IQR 3.00-3.30] vs. 3.00 cpm [2.90-3.10], p<0.001), and highest in users of progestogen-only formulations (p<0.02). 
Conclusion: Women with gastrointestinal disorders on hormonal contraception experience increased nausea in comparison to non-users of hormonal contraception, with substantial variation in nausea severity dependent on contraceptive type. Hormonal contraception users also demonstrated modified gastric electrophysiology. Women with chronic gastroduodenal symptoms should be asked about their use of hormonal contraception and non-hormonal contraceptive alternatives trialled as a means to reduce symptoms."

Falls are the leading cause of injury in older adults and can lead to substantial costs for the individual and society. Eye care practitioners in the community provide services for a large proportion of the older adult population and can play a key role in falls prevention, however it is unclear whether they are implementing evidence-based recommendations in practice. The aim of this scoping review is to map and synthesise the current evidence for community-based eye care practitioners translating falls prevention evidence into clinical practice. 

Methods and analysis 
The study will use the framework by Arksey and OMalley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Studies that have been published in English from 1990 to current on the topic of eye care practitioners and falls prevention in older adults will be searched on MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHLPlus databases. Grey literature will be searched using Web of Science and OpenMD. The titles and abstracts of results will be screened against the inclusion criteria and full texts will be analysed. Data from final included articles will be extracted by two independent reviewers using a tool created according to the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines. The World Falls Guidelines will be used as a framework for data mapping. Results will be charted, collated, and summarised narratively.

Ethics and dissemination 
It is anticipated that the results from this scoping review will highlight any gaps in the literature regarding eye care practitioner awareness and implementation of falls prevention guidelines and inform future research and clinical recommendations. Ethics approval is not required. Findings will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication."

Methods: We analysed HIV testing and viral load data collected between 2013-2019 from the open, population-based Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) in Uganda, to estimate HIV seroprevalence and population viral suppression over time by gender, one-year age bands and residence in inland and fishing communities. All estimates were standardized to the underlying source population using census data. We then assessed 95-95-95 targets in their ability to identify the populations in which viraemia concentrates.

Results: Following the implementation of Universal Test and Treat, the proportion of individuals with viraemia decreased from 4.9% (4.6%-5.3%) in 2013 to 1.9% (1.7%-2.2%) in 2019 in inland communities and from 19.1% (18.0%-20.4%) in 2013 to 4.7% (4.0%-5.5%) in 2019 in fishing communities. Viraemia did not concentrate in the age and gender groups furthest from achieving 95-95-95 targets. Instead, in both inland and fishing communities, women aged 25-29 and men aged 30-34 were the 5-year age groups that contributed most to population-level viraemia in 2019, despite these groups being close to or had already achieved 95-95-95 targets.

Conclusions: The 95-95-95 targets provide a useful benchmark for monitoring progress towards HIV epidemic control, but do not contextualize underlying population structures and so may direct interventions towards groups that represent a marginal fraction of the population with viraemia."

Individuals with variants in the NAA15 coding region develop NAA15-related neurodevelopmental syndrome which presents with a wide array of manifestations that affect the heart, brain, musculoskeletal system, and behavioral and cognitive development. We tracked a cohort of 26 participants (8 females and 18 males) over time, each with a pathogenic NAA15 variant, and administered the Vineland-3 assessment to them to assess their adaptive functioning. We found that the cohort performed significantly worse compared to the normalized Vineland values. On average, females performed better than males across all domains. They performed significantly better on the Motor Domain and Fine Motor Sub-Domain portions of the assessment. Over time, females showed  a decrease in adaptive functioning with the decline being especially strongly correlated at the Coping sub-domain, Domestic sub-domain, and Fine motor sub-domains. It is difficult to determine the strength of these correlations due to limited power. Males (after excluding one outlier) showed a moderate positive correlation between age and ABC standard score. Ultimately, additional longitudinal data should be collected to determine the validity of the between sex-differences and to better understand the change in adaptive behavioral outcomes of individuals with NAA15-neurodevelopmental disorder as they age."

In physicians, the effects of elevated stress levels exceed the individual level and include treatment errors and reduced quality of patient-doctor relationships. Breathing and mindfulness-based exercises have been shown to reduce stress and could serve as an immediate and easy-to-implement anti-stress intervention among physicians. Due to the heterogeneity of their effect on stress, we aim to evaluate the intervention effect of performing a short daily breathwork-based or mindfulness-based intervention on the everyday level of perceived stress in physicians in residence in Germany in a series of N-of-1 trials.
Study participants will choose between two short interventions, box breathing, and one guided more complex mindfulness-based breathing exercise. Each participant subsequently will be randomly allocated to a sequence of 1-week intervention (A) and control (B, everyday life) phases. Each N-of-1 trial consists of two two-week cycles (AB or BA), resulting in a total trial duration of 4 weeks (ABAB or BABA). Perceived levels of stress will be assessed daily via the StudyU App on the participant's smartphone. Additionally, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire at baseline and three months after completion of the study that contains questions about basic participant characteristics, lifestyle factors, individual living situations, and validated psychological questionnaires. Intervention effects will be estimated by Bayesian multi-level random effects models on the individual and population level.
This study contributes to the development of short-term solutions to reduce work-related stress for physicians in residence. This is expected to benefit the individual and increase the quality of overall healthcare due to a reduction in treatment errors and an increase in the quality of doctor-patient relationships."

To date, however, the locus of these effects is unknown. We use intracortical microstimulation of somatosensory cortex in humans as a tool to bypass initial stages of processing and restrict the possible locations that signals could be modified. We find that, using both amplitude discrimination and magnitude estimation paradigms, intracortical microstimulation reliably evoked time-order errors across all participants. Points of subjective equality were symmetrically shifted during amplitude discrimination experiments and the intensity of a successive stimulus was perceived as being more intense when compared to single stimulus trials in magnitude estimation experiments. The error was reduced for both paradigms at longer inter-stimulus intervals. These results show that direct activation of primary somatosensory cortex is sufficient to induce time-order errors."

Given the cost and unclear clinical impact of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), laboratory stewardship may improve utilization. This study examines mNGS results from two academic medical centers employing different stewardship approaches.
Methods
80 mNGS orders (54 CSF and 26 plasma) were identified from 2019 to 2021 at the University of Washington (UW), which requires director-level approval for mNGS orders, and the University of Utah (Utah), which does not restrict ordering. The impact of mNGS results and the relationship to traditional microbiology orders were retrospectively evaluated.
Results
19% (10/54) CSF and 65% (17/26) plasma studies detected at least one organism. Compared to CSF results, plasma results were more frequently clinically significant (23% vs 7%) and led to more novel diagnoses (15% vs 0%). Results affecting antibiotic management were more common for plasma than CSF (32% vs. 2%). Stewardship practices were not associated with statistically significant differences in results or antimicrobial management. The number and cost of traditional microbiology tests at UW was greater than Utah for CSF mNGS testing (UW: 46 tests, $6237; Utah: 26 tests, $2812; p<0.05) but similar for plasma mNGS (UW: 31 tests, $3975; Utah: 21 tests, $2715; p=0.14). mNGS testing accounted for 30-50% of the total microbiology costs.
Conclusions
Improving the diagnostic performance of mNGS by stewardship remains challenging due to low positivity rates and difficulties assessing clinical impact. From a fiscal perspective, stewardship efforts should focus on reducing testing in low-yield populations given the high costs of mNGS relative to overall microbiology testing expenditures."

The work was motivated by Australia's desire to safely increase international arrival volumes, which had been heavily constrained since early 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These analyses supported decisions on quarantine and border policy in the context of the Australian government's national reopening plan in late 2021. 

The quarantine model provides a detailed representation of transmission within quarantine and time-varying infectiousness and test sensitivity within individuals, to characterise the likelihood and infectiousness of breaches from quarantine. The community model subsequently captures the impact these infectious individuals have in the presence of varying vaccination coverage, arrival volumes, public health and social measures (PHSMs) and test-trace-isolate-quarantine system effectiveness in the Australian context.

Our results showed that high vaccination coverage would be required to safely reopen with support from ongoing PHSMs, and quarantine pathways have minimal impact on infection dynamics in the presence of existing local transmission. The modelling pipeline we present can be flexibly adapted to a range of scenarios and thus provides a useful framework for generating timely risk assessments in the event of future pandemics."

Current research suggests that various aspects of aging are genetically modulated and thus may be slowed via genetic modification.  Here, we show evidence for epigenetic modulation of the aging process in the brain from over 1800 individuals as part of the Framingham Heart Study.  We investigated the methylation of genes in the protocadherin (PCDH) clusters, including the alpha (PCHDA), beta (PCDHB), and gamma (PCDHG) clusters.  Reduced PCDHG, elevated PCDHA, and elevated PCDHB methylation levels were associated with substantial reductions in the rate of decline of regional white matter volume as well as certain cognitive skills, independent of overall accelerated or retarded aging as estimated by a DNA clock.  These results are likely due to the different effects of the expression of genes in the alpha, beta, and gamma PCHD clusters and suggest that experience-based aging processes related to a decline in regional brain volume and select cognitive skills may be slowed via targeted epigenetic modifications."

However, physiological network analysis is not commonly used in clinical practice and awaits quantitative evidence.  Acute liver failure (ALF) is associated with multiorgan failure and mortality. Prognostication in ALF is highly important for clinical management but is currently dependent on models that do not consider the interaction between organ systems. This study is aimed to examine the impact of physiological network analysis, in prognostication of patients with ALF.
Data from 640 adult patients admitted to the ICU for paracetamol-induced ALF were extracted from the MIMIC-III database. Parenclitic network analysis was performed on the routine biomarkers and network clusters were identified using the k-clique percolation method.  
Network analysis showed that the liver function biomarkers were more clustered in survivors than in non-survivors.  Arterial pH was also found to cluster with serum creatinine and bicarbonate in survivors compared with non-survivors, where it clustered with respiratory nodes indicating physiologically distinctive compensatory mechanism.  Deviation along the pH-bicarbonate and pH-creatinine axes could significantly predict mortality independent of current prognostic indicators. These results demonstrate that network analysis can provide pathophysiologic insight and predict survival in critically ill patients with ALF."

Exploring the genetic architecture of circulating cytokine levels could yield key insights into causal mediators of human disease. Here, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 40 circulating cytokines in meta-analyses of 74,783 individuals. We detected 359 significant associations between cytokine levels and variants in 169 independent loci, including 150 trans- and 19 cis-acting loci. Integration with transcriptomic data point to key regulatory mechanisms, such as the buffering function of ACKR1 acting as scavenger for multiple chemokines and the role of TRAFD1 in modulating the cytokine storm triggered by TNF signaling. Applying Mendelian randomization (MR), we detected a network of complex cytokine interconnections with TNF-b, VEGF, and IL-1ra exhibiting pleiotropic downstream effects on multiple cytokines. Drug target cis-MR paired with colocalization revealed G-CSF/CSF-3 and CXCL9/MIG as potential causal mediators of asthma and Crohns disease, respectively, but also a potentially protective role of TNF-b in multiple sclerosis. Our results provide an overview of the genetic architecture of circulating cytokines and could guide the development of targeted immunotherapies."

Antibody responses to mosquito salivary proteins such as SG6 have previously been used as biomarkers of exposure to Anopheles mosquito bites. Here, we investigate four mosquito salivary proteins as potential biomarkers of human exposure to mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum: mosGILT, SAMSP1, AgSAP, and AgTRIO.  

Methods: We tested population-level human immune responses in longitudinal and cross-sectional plasma samples from individuals with known P. falciparum infection from low and moderate transmission areas in Senegal using a multiplexed magnetic bead-based assay.

Results: AgSAP and AgTRIO were the best indicators of recent exposure to infected mosquitoes.  Antibody responses to AgSAP, in a moderate endemic area, and to AgTRIO in both low and moderate endemic areas, were significantly higher than responses in a healthy non-endemic control cohort (p-values = 0.0245, 0.0064, and <0.0001 respectively). No antibody responses significantly differed between the low and moderate transmission area, or between equivalent groups during and outside the malaria transmission seasons. For AgSAP and AgTRIO, reactivity peaked 2-4 weeks after clinical P. falciparum infection and declined 3 months after infection. 

Discussion: Reactivity to both AgSAP and AgTRIO peaked after infection and did not differ seasonally nor between areas of low and moderate transmission, suggesting reactivity is likely reflective of exposure to infectious mosquitos or recent biting rather than general mosquito exposure. Kinetics suggest reactivity is relatively short-lived. AgSAP and AgTRIO are promising candidates to incorporate into multiplexed assays for serosurveillance of population-level changes in P. falciparum-infected mosquito exposure."

However, optimal doses of beta-blockers or RAS inhibitors in women with atrial fibrillation (AF) with and without HF are unclear. We investigated sex-specific associations of beta-blocker and RAS inhibitor doses with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with AF with and without HF.

Methods: We used data from the prospective BEAT-AF and Swiss-AF cohorts on patients with AF. The outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolization, and HF-related hospitalization. Predictors of interest were spline (primary analysis) or quartiles (secondary analysis) of beta-blocker or RAS inhibitor dose in percent of the maximum dose (reference), in interaction with sex. Cox models were adjusted for demographics, comorbidities and co-medication.

Results: Among 3,961 patients (28% women), MACE occurred in 1,113 (28%) patients over 5-year median follow-up. Distributions of RAS inhibitor and beta-blocker doses were similar in women and men. Cox models revealed no association between beta-blocker dose or RAS inhibitor dose and MACE  . In a subgroup of patients with AF and HF, the lowest hazard of MACE was observed in women prescribed 100% of RAS inhibitor dose. However, there was no association between RAS dose quartiles and MACE. 

Conclusions: In these two cohorts of patients with AF, doses of beta-blockers and RAS inhibitors did not differ by sex and were overall not associated with MACE."

Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) often experience cognitive impairment, and this is related to structural disconnection and subsequent functional reorganization. It is not clear how specific patterns of functional reorganization might make it harder for cognitively impaired (CI) MS patients to dynamically adapt how brain regions communicate, which is crucial for normal cognition. To identify patterns relevant to cognitive impairment in MS, we performed a temporally detailed analysis of connectivity state transitions and quantified the effort associated with such dynamic alterations.
Methods. Resting-state functional and diffusion MRI was acquired from 95 controls and 330 MS patients (mean disease duration: 15 years) in a cross-sectional design, of whom 86 were classified as CI (≥2/7 domains Z < −2) and 65 as mildly CI (≥2/7 domains Z < −1.5) based on the performance on an expanded Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests. Four functional connectivity states were determined using K-means clustering of moment-to-moment co-fluctuations (i.e., edge time series), and the resulting state sequence was used to characterize the frequency of transitions between network configurations. The control energy associated with the transitions between states was then calculated using the structural network of each subject with network control theory.
Results. CI patients transition less frequently between connectivity states. Relative to the time spent in a particular state, CI patients specifically transition less from a weakly connected and highly modular state (i.e., the weakly connected state) to a more integrated state that featured strong involvement of the visual network (i.e., the visual network state), but more in the opposite direction. CI patients also required more control energy to transition between states.
Discussion. This study showed that it became more effortful for MS patients with cognitive impairment to dynamically change the organization of the functional network, providing an intuitive understanding of why these transitions occur less frequently in some patients. In particular, transitions between the weakly connected state and the more integrated visual network state were relevant for cognition in these patients. The findings highlight a possible underpinning of disturbed cognition in MS patients and also provide novel avenues for studying and possibly improving network dynamics."

This study aims to compare the incidence of adverse events (AEs) with GLP1RAs and other anti obesity medications (AOMs) after bariatric surgery. 

Methods: This single center retrospective cohort included patients (ages 16, 65) if they met the following criteria: underwent laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy (cohort entry date) and initiated AOMs. Subjects were categorized as users of FDA approved or off label AOMs or GLP1RAs AOMs if documented as receiving the medication on the cohort entry date or after. Non GLP1RA AOMs were Phentermine, Orlistat, Topiramate, Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin, Naltrexone, Bupropion/Naltrexone, and Phentermine/Topiramate. GLP1RAs AOMs included: Semaglutide, Dulaglutide, Exenatide, Liraglutide. Primary outcome was AEs incidence. Logistic regression was used to determine the association of AOM exposure with AEs.

Results: We identified 599 patients meeting inclusion criteria (83% female, median 47.8 years old (IQR 40.9, 55.4). Median surgery to AOM duration was 30 months (IQR 0, 62). GLP1RAs were not associated with higher odds of AEs (adjusted Odds Ratio, (aOR) 1.1, [95% CI 0.5, 2.6] and 1.1 [95% CI 0.6, 2.3] for GLP1RA versus FDA approved and Off Label AOMs, respectively. AOM initiation ≥12 months after surgery was associated with lower risk of AEs compared to <12 months (aOR 0.01. [95% CI 0.0, 0.01], p<0.001). 

Conclusion: GLP1RAs were not associated with an increased risk of AEs compared to nonGLP1RA AOMs in patients who previously underwent bariatric surgery. Prospective studies are needed to identify the optimal timeframe for initiation of GLP1RA."

These episignatures inform about underlying pathogenic mechanisms and can be used to assess the pathogenicity of genomic variants as well as confirm clinical diagnoses. Currently, episignature detection requires the use of indirect methylation profiling microarrays. We hypothesized that long-read whole genome sequencing would not only enable the detection of single nucleotide variants and structural variants but also episignatures.
Methods: Genome-wide nanopore sequencing was performed in forty controls and twenty patients with confirmed or suspected episignature-associated DD, representing thirteen distinct diseases. Following variant and methylome calling, hierarchical clustering and dimensional reduction were used to determine the compatibility with microarray-based episignatures. Subsequently, we developed a support vector machine for each DD.
Results: Nanopore sequencing based methylome patterns were concordant with microarray-based episignatures. Our classifier identified episignatures in 17/20 disease samples and none in the control samples. The remaining three patient samples were classified as controls by both our classifier  and  a commercial microarray assay. In addition, we identified all underlying pathogenic single nucleotide and structural variants and showed haplotype-aware skewed X-inactivation evaluation directs clinical interpretation. 
Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates nanopore sequencing enables concurrent haplotyped genomic and epigenomic analyses."

A similar strategy is pursued by vendors of recently introduced e-cigarette liquids containing nicotinamide, marketed as Nixotine or Nixamide.  Compared to nicotine, 6-methyl nicotine is pharmacologically more potent at nicotinic receptors, and more toxic, raising concerns about increased addictiveness and adverse effects. Here, combinations of gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to determine nicotine analogs, flavor and sweetener contents of e-cigarette liquids of the brands SpreeBar and Nixotine products. All SpreeBar products, labelled as containing 5% 6-methyl nicotine, contained only 0.61-0.64% 6 methylnicotine, while Nixotine samples contained 7-46% less of the declared nicotinamide contents. Although Nixotine product labels did not list 6MN as an ingredient, small amounts of 6-methyl nicotine were detected. All SpreeBar samples contained the artificial sweetener neotame (0.20-0.86μg/mg). Results identified significant discrepancies between declared and measured constituents of e-cigarette products containing nicotine alternatives. The discrepancy is misleading for consumers and raises concerns about production errors. SpreeBar products also contained neotame, a high-intensity sweetener with high heat stability, likely increasing appeal to young and first-time users. Novel e-cigarette products with misleading labels containing nicotine analogs instead of nicotine on the US market is concerning and should be urgently addressed by lawmakers and regulators."

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) shows brain immaturity assessed via a cortical-based semi-quantitative score. Our primary aim was to develop an infant paralimbic-related subcortical-based semi-quantitative dysmaturation score, a brain dysplasia score (BDS), to detect abnormalities in CHD infants and predict clinical outcomes. Our secondary aim was to validate our BDS in a preclinical mouse model of hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

Methods
A paralimbic-related subcortical BDS, derived from structural MRIs of infants with CHD, was correlated with clinical risk factors, regional cerebral volumes, feeding and 18-month neurodevelopmental outcomes. The BDS was validated in a known CHD mouse model named Ohia with two disease-causing genes, Sap130 and Pchda9. To relate clinical findings, RNA-Seq was completed on Ohia animals.

Findings
BDS showed high incidence of paralimbic-related subcortical abnormalities (including olfactory, cerebellar, and hippocampal abnormalities) in CHD infants (n=215) compared to healthy controls (n=92). BDS correlated with reduced cortical maturation, developmental delay, poor language and feeding outcomes, and increased length of stay. Ohia animals (n=63) showed similar BDS findings, and RNA-Seq analysis showed altered neurodevelopmental and feeding pathways. Sap130 mutants correlated with a more severe BDS whereas Pcdha9 correlated with a milder phenotype.

Interpretation
Our BDS is sensitive to dysmaturational differences between CHD and healthy controls, and predictive of poor outcomes. A similar spectrum of paralimbic-related subcortical abnormalities exists between human and Ohia mutants suggesting a common genetic mechanistic etiology."

We aimed to identify potentially modifiable risk factors and therapeutic targets for preventing or treating PMR.
Methods: We meta-analysed genetic association data from 8,156 cases of PMR (defined using diagnostic codes and self-report) and 416,495 controls of European ancestry from the UK Biobank and FinnGen. We then performed Mendelian randomization analyses to estimate the association between eight modifiable risk factors (using data from up to 1.2 million individuals) and 65 inflammation-related circulating proteins (up to 55,792 individuals), using the inverse variance weighted and pleiotropy robust methods.
Results: We identified three novel genome-wide significant loci in the IL1R1, NEK6 and CCDC88B genes and confirmation of previously described associations with HLA-DRB1 and ANKRD55. Genetically predicted smoking intensity (OR 1.32; 95%CI 1.08-1.60; p=0.006) and visceral adiposity (OR 1.22; 95%CI 1.10-1.37; p=3.10x10-4) were associated with PMR susceptibility. Multiple circulating proteins related to IL-1 family signaling were associated with PMR. IL-1 receptor-like 2, also known as IL-36 receptor (OR 1.25; p=1.89x10-32), serum amyloid A2 (OR 1.06, 9.91x10-10) and CXCL6 (OR 1.09, p=4.85x10-7) retained significance after correction for multiple testing.  
Conclusion: Reducing smoking and visceral adiposity at a population level might reduce incidence of PMR. We identified proteins that may play causal roles in PMR, potentially suggesting new therapeutic opportunities. Further research is needed before these findings are applied to clinical practice."

In this 10-year longitudinal study we aimed to characterize the temporal evolution of cortical correlates of psychosis and their associations with symptoms.
Design: Structural MRI from people with first-episode psychosis and controls (n=79 and 218) were obtained at enrollment, after 12 months (n=67 and 197), and 10 years (n=23 and 77), within the Thematically Organized Psychosis (TOP) study. Normative models for cortical thickness estimated on public MRI datasets (n=42983) were applied to TOP data to obtain deviation scores for each region and timepoint. Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores were acquired at each timepoint along with registry data. Linear mixed effects (LME) models assessed effects of diagnosis, time and their interactions on cortical deviations plus associations with symptoms.
Results: LMEs revealed main effects of diagnosis and time x diagnosis interactions in a distributed cortical network, where negative deviations in patients attenuate over time. In patients, symptoms also attenuate over time. LMEs revealed effects of anterior cingulate on PANSS total scores, and insular and orbitofrontal regions on PANSS negative scores.
Conclusions: This long-term longitudinal study revealed a distributed pattern of cortical differences which attenuated over time together with a reduction in symptoms. These findings are not in line with a simple neurodegenerative account of schizophrenia, and deviations from normative models offer a promising avenue to develop biomarkers to track clinical trajectories over time."

Objectives: To quantify the agreement of LLMs with human consensus in appraisal of scientific reporting (PRISMA) and methodological rigor (AMSTAR) of systematic reviews and design of clinical trials (PRECIS-2). To identify areas, where human-AI collaboration would outperform the traditional consensus process of human raters in efficiency.
Design: Five LLMs (Claude-3-Opus, Claude-2, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x22B) assessed 112 systematic reviews applying the PRISMA and AMSTAR criteria, and 56 randomized controlled trials applying PRECIS-2. We quantified agreement between human consensus and (1) individual human raters; (2) individual LLMs; (3) combined LLMs approach; (4) human-AI collaboration. Ratings were marked as deferred (undecided) in case of inconsistency between combined LLMs or between the human rater and the LLM.
Results: Individual human rater accuracy was 89% for PRISMA and AMSTAR, and 75% for PRECIS-2. Individual LLM accuracy was ranging from 63% (GPT-3.5) to 70% (Claude-3-Opus) for PRISMA, 53% (GPT-3.5) to 74% (Claude-3-Opus) for AMSTAR, and 38% (GPT-4) to 55% (GPT-3.5) for PRECIS-2. Combined LLM ratings led to accuracies of 75-88% for PRISMA (4-74% deferred), 74-89% for AMSTAR (6-84% deferred), and 64-79% for PRECIS-2 (18-88% deferred). Human-AI collaboration resulted in the best accuracies from 89-96% for PRISMA (25/35% deferred), 91-95% for AMSTAR (27/30% deferred), and 80-86% for PRECIS-2 (76/71% deferred).
Conclusions: Current LLMs alone appraised evidence worse than humans. Human-AI collaboration may reduce workload for the second human rater for the assessment of reporting (PRISMA) and methodological rigor (AMSTAR) but not for complex tasks such as PRECIS-2."

In addition, the spread of Plasmodium falciparum with partial artemisinin resistance in East Africa and beyond is a great concern. The establishment of more effective vector control, in addition to the current long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) distribution program, is an urgent task in these areas. One novel vector control candidate is the OlysetPlus ceiling nets which can overcome the problems of variations in net use behaviors and metabolic resistance to insecticide in vectors. Our preliminary study suggests the protective efficacy and high acceptability of this tool. With this proposed second trial, we aim to evaluate the impact of this tool in a different eco-epidemiological setting in the lake endemic region of Kenya.
Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate the impact of OlysetPlus ceiling nets in Ndhiwa Sub-County, Homa Bay County, Kenya. A total of 44 clusters will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention group (OlysetPlus ceiling nets) and the control group. The assignment will be accomplished through covariate-constrained randomization of clusters. For the primary outcome of clinical malaria incidence, 38 children from each cluster will be enrolled in a cohort and followed for 18 months. We will also evaluate the effects of the intervention on entomological indicators as well as its acceptance by communities and cost-effectiveness.
Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was provided by the Mount Kenya University Institutional Scientific Ethics Review Committee. Study results will be shared with study participants and communities, the Homa Bay County Government and the Kenya National Malaria Control Programme. Results will also be disseminated through publications, conferences and workshops to help the development of novel malaria control strategies in other malaria-endemic countries.

For newly emerging variants, it is still hard to predict how possibly they could impact the pandemic/endemic course. The spreading of highly transmissible variant XBB.1.5 and JN.1 has brought many questions. Could the high transmission ability of such variant lead to a different global spreading pattern compared to other previously existing variants of concern (VOCs)? How that may possibly affect the further evolution of SARS-CoV-2?  This study aimed to explore the evolution course of SARS-CoV-2 variants, with focus on VOCs. The investigation was carried out through integration of multiple virus genomic epidemiology approaches. Phylogeny and phylodynamic analyses were used to investigate dynamic changes of virus evolution course. Through this study, an overview check of the evolution events of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including the alpha variant, delta variant and omicron variant, has been performed, and the further course of evolution has been predicted, especially taking the potential impact of the spreading of XBB.1.5 and JN.1 into consideration. Furthermore, the early spreading pattern of XBB.1.5 was compared with the early spreading patterns of BQ.1.1 to investigate the impact of evolution on virus spreading pattern.  The information acquired through this study provided insights into the effect of SARS-CoV-2 evolution on spreading pattern and the potential impact of the spreading of XBB.1.5 and JN.1 on the further evolution of SARS-CoV-2."

Copy number variations (CNVs) of these repeats contributes to the global chromatin architecture and genome expression changes in response to stress or pathology. An elevated rDNA abundance and lowered contents of f-SatIII and TR were found in blood leukocytes of patients with schizophrenia. The main question of the study was: are the CNVs of the three repeat types in blood leukocytes a universal phenomenon linked to a pathology associated with chronic oxidative stress? Cystic fibrosis (CF), a monogenic disease was chosen as an object of the study. 
Materials and Methods: We determined the rDNA, f-SatIII and TR content in the blood leukocyte genomes of 545 subjects aged 0.2 to 50 years. The subjects were divided into three groups: Control (HC-group, N = 267), CF group (N= 186) and CF(d) group (severe patients, who died after some time upon sampling, aged 17 to 40 years, N = 92). For each patient, the type of the mutation in CFTR gene had been determined earlier. Non-radioactive quantitative hybridization technique was applied to quantify the repeats.
Results: the rDNA abundance was elevated in the DNA of CF and CF(d) groups (565+/-105 copies per genome, N=278) compared to HC group (445+/-112 copies, N=267). A patient's age 3 to 16 years was associated with ""severe"" mutations in CFTR (98% of cases), increased f-SatIII repeat counts and decreased telomere repeat (TR) contents in genome DNA compared to the age-matched controls. The genomes of deceased patients from CF(d) group also harbored increased numbers of f-SatIII and decreased numbers of TR. Patients above 16 years with a milder course of the disease and relatively low content of ""severe"" CFTR mutations contained less f-SatIII and more TR in their genomic DNA. A parameter rDNA*(f-SatIII/TR) showed a maximum difference between patients with relatively mild (age 17 to 40) and severe (age 17 to 40) forms of the pathology according to ROC analysis data (AUC = 0.86).
Conclusion: Cystic fibrosis was associated with an increase in rDNA abundance and altered f-SatIII and TR contents in the DNA of cases compared to the controls. The severe course of the disease was characterized with high f-SatIII contents and shortened telomeres, whereas mild CF cases were associated with low contents of f-SatIII and normal or slightly reduced telomere length. The index rDNA*(f-SatIII/TR) might be a predictor of the patient's life expectancy."

A total of 92 unique and independent loci were identified for 11 DXA-derived BMD traits and fracture, including five novel loci (harboring genes such as ABCA1, CHSY1, CYP24A1, SWAP70, and PAX1) for six BMD traits. These loci exhibited evidence of association in both males and females, which could serve as independent replication. We demonstrated that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were independently associated with fracture risk. Although incorporating multiple PRSs (metaPRS) with the clinical risk factors (i.e., the FRAX model) exhibited the highest predictive performance, the improvement was marginal in fracture prediction. The metaPRS were capable of stratifying individuals into different trajectories of fracture risk, but clinical risk factors played a more significant role in the stratification. Additionally, we uncovered genetic correlation and shared polygenicity between head BMD and intracranial aneurysm. Finally, by integrating gene expression and GWAS datasets, we prioritized genes (e.g. ESR1 and SREBF1) encoding druggable human proteins along with their respective inhibitors/antagonists. In conclusion, this comprehensive investigation revealed a new genetic basis for BMD and its clinical relevance on fracture prediction. More importantly, it was suggested that head BMD was genetically correlated with intracranial aneurysm. The prioritization of genetically supported targets implied the potential repurposing drugs (e.g. the n-3 PUFA supplement targeting SREBF1) for the prevention of osteoporosis."

Clinically, they can be grouped into two main variants, namely into patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). The distinction of the two variants is known to be clinically significant as they exhibit different progression rates to dementia. However, it has been particularly challenging to classify the two variants robustly. Recent research indicates that linguistic changes may manifest as one of the early indicators of pathology. Therefore, we focused on MCI's discourse-level writing samples in this study. We hypothesized that a written picture description task can provide information that can be used as an ecological, cost-effective classification system between the two variants. 
Methods: We included one hundred sixty-nine individuals diagnosed with either aMCI or naMCI who received neurophysiological evaluations in addition to a short-written picture description task. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and BERT pre-trained Language Models were utilized to analyze the writing samples. 
Results: We showed that the written picture description task provided 90% overall classification accuracy for the best classification models, which performs better than cognitive measures. Discussion: Written discourses analyzed the AI models can automatically assess individuals with aMCI and naMCI and facilitate diagnosis, prognosis, therapy planning, and evaluation."

Transcription factors (TFs) regulate the expression of related gene sets, thereby controlling these diverse expression states. Apolipoprotein E (APOE), a pivotal risk-modifying gene in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is expressed in specific glial transcriptional states associated with AD. However, it is still unknown whether the upstream regulatory programs that modulate its expression are shared across brain cell types or specific to microglia and astrocytes.
 
Methods: We used pySCENIC to construct state-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for resting and activated cell states within microglia and astrocytes based on single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from AD patients' cortices from the Knight ADRC-DIAN cohort. We then identified replicating TF using data from the ROSMAP cohort. We identified sets of genes co-regulated with APOE by clustering the GRN target genes and identifying genes differentially expressed after the virtual knockout of TFs regulating APOE. We performed enrichment analyses on these gene sets and evaluated their overlap with genes found in AD GWAS loci.
 
Results: We identified an average of 96 replicating regulators for each microglial and astrocyte cell state. Our analysis identified the CEBP, JUN, FOS, and FOXO TF families as key regulators of microglial APOE expression. The steroid/thyroid hormone receptor families, including the THR TF family, consistently regulated APOE across astrocyte states, while CEBP and JUN TF families were also involved in resting astrocytes. AD GWAS-associated genes (PGRN, FCGR3A, CTSH, ABCA1, MARCKS, CTSB, SQSTM1, TSC22D4, FCER1G, and HLA genes) are co-regulated with APOE. We also uncovered that APOE-regulating TFs were linked to circadian rhythm (BHLHE40, DBP, XBP1, CREM, SREBF1, FOXO3, and NR2F1).
 
Conclusions: Our findings reveal a novel perspective on the transcriptional regulation of APOE in the human brain. We found a comprehensive and cell-type-specific regulatory landscape for APOE, revealing distinct and shared regulatory mechanisms across microglia and astrocytes, underscoring the complexity of APOE regulation. APOE-co-regulated genes might also affect AD risk. Furthermore, our study uncovers a potential link between circadian rhythm disruption and APOE regulation, shedding new light on the pathogenesis of AD."

Diminished inflammatory disease activities (DAs) as people with MS (pwMS) age justified randomized clinical trials assessing disease-modifying therapy (DMT) discontinuation in older pwMS given the concern for risks outweighing benefits. 
Objective: This study aims to examine the effect of age on DAs and the peripheral production of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP)-driven cytokine response in pwMS. 
Methods: We included the clinical data of 368 adult pwMS between 2017 and 2021 who enrolled in a clinic-based prospective cohort. From 80 participants, we isolated fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cultured with 50μg/ml of MBP for 24 hours. We assayed cell culture supernatants for interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma;) using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and a subset of the supernatant samples using a commercial human cytokine/chemokine array. We examined the associations between age and annualized relapse rate (ARR) as well as between age and MBP-stimulated cytokine production (by cultured PBMC) using covariate-adjusted linear regressions. We performed mediation analyses to determine the extent to which MBP-driven cytokine responses drive the association between age and ARR.
Results: Among the 386 pwMS (mean age 53.1±12.6 years, 79.9% women, 92.1% non-Hispanic White), ARR declined with age (β=-0.003, p<0.001). Among the 80 pwMS whose cultured PBMCs underwent ex vivo MBP stimulation, IL-17 production declined with age in women (β=-0.27, p=0.04) but not men (β=-0.1, p=0.73). MBP-driven IL-17 response partially mediated the association between older age and lower ARR (24.7% in women, 15.3% in men). Further, older pwMS (≥50 years) had significantly lower (IL-4, MCP-2, MCP-3, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB) and higher (Fractalkine, MDC) concentrations of several cytokines when compared to younger pwMS (<50 years). These cytokines affected the association between age and ARR in different ways, with some (MCP-2 and MDC) mediating the effect of age on ARR, while the others counteracting the effect of age on ARR.
Conclusion: This study suggests some of the potential biological mechanisms driving aging-dependent decline in MS inflammatory DA."

Extreme but discrete fine particle <2.5μm (PM2.5) exposure is associated with higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms. It was unknown whether these effects abate, persist, or worsen over time, nor whether they are exacerbated by COVID-19. 
Methods
We analysed longitudinal survey data from a cohort residing near a 2014 coalmine fire in regional Australia. A 2016/2017 survey included 4,056 participants, of whom 612 were followed-up in 2022. Items included questions on respiratory symptoms, history of COVID-19, and time-location diaries that were combined with geospatial and temporal models of fire-related PM2.5. Associations were examined using logistic and mixed-effects logistic regressions.
Results
PM2.5 exposure predicted higher prevalence of chronic cough and current wheeze 2-3 years post-fire. At the 2022 follow-up, PM2.5 exposure was associated with worsening prevalence of chronic cough and possibly current wheeze. While there were no detectable interaction effects between PM2.5 and COVID-19, PM2.5 exposure was associated with additional respiratory symptoms among participants who reported a history of COVID-19.
Conclusion
Short-term but extreme PM2.5 may increase the long-term prevalence of chronic cough, while COVID-19 may exacerbate the effect on additional respiratory symptoms."

Methods: 20 participants (14 women) with bipolar disorder, mean age 50.75 + 10.46 years, in a depressive episode of severe severity (mean Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) score 24.60 + 2.87) received home-based transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) treatment for 6 weeks. Clinical remission defined as MADRS score < 10. Resting-state EEG data were acquired at baseline, prior to the start of treatment, and at the end of treatment, using a portable 4-channel EEG device (electrode positions: AF7, AF8, TP9, TP10). EEG band power was extracted for each electrode and phase locking value (PLV) was computed as a functional connectivity measure of phase synchronization. Deep learning was applied to pre-treatment PLV features to examine potential predictors of clinical remission. 

Results: Following treatment, 11 participants (9 women) attained clinical remission. A significant positive correlation was observed with improvements in depressive symptoms and delta band PLV in frontal and temporoparietal regional channel pairs. An interaction effect in network synchronisation was observed in beta band PLV in temporoparietal regions, in which participants who attained clinical remission showed increased synchronisation following tDCS treatment, which was decreased in participants who did not achieve clinical remission. Main effects of clinical remission status were observed in several PLV bands: clinical remission following tDCS treatment was associated with increased PLV in frontal and temporal regions and in several frequency bands, including delta, theta, alpha and beta, as compared to participants who did not achieve clinical remission. The highest deep learning prediction accuracy 69.45% (sensitivity 71.68%, specificity 66.72%) was obtained from PLV features combined from theta, beta, and gamma bands. 

Conclusions: tDCS treatment enhances network synchronisation, potentially increasing inhibitory control, which underscores improvement in depressive symptoms. EEG-based measures might might aid predicting clinical response."

Basic journal- and article-related information was retrieved from the database. We then assessed five transparency practices in the articles using the rtransparent package in R.
Results: The analysis included 2,002,955 open-access articles from SCIE-indexed medical journals. Of these, 87.5% (95% CI: 87.4%-87.5%) disclosed COI and 80.1% (95% CI: 80.0%-80.1%) disclosed funding. Protocol registration was declared in 6.6% (95% CI: 6.6%-6.6%), data sharing in 7.6% (95% CI: 7.6%-7.6%), and code sharing in 1.4% (95% CI: 1.4%-1.4%) of the articles. More than 76.0% declared at least two transparency practices, while all five practices were declared in less than 0.02%. The data showed an increasing trend in all transparency practices since the late 2000s. Articles published in journals with higher impact factors and articles receiving more citations had increased odds of COI and funding disclosures, as well as data and code sharing. There were notable differences in transparency practices across the disciplines.
Conclusion: While most articles had COI and funding disclosures, adherence to other transparency practices was grossly insufficient. To increase protocol registration, data, and code sharing, much stronger incentives and mandates are needed from all stakeholders."

The left and right ventricles of the human heart are functionally and developmentally distinct such that genetic or acquired insults can cause dysfunction in one or both ventricles resulting in heart failure. The left ventricle is most clinically relevant in research as its dysfunction is the most dominant cause of heart failure whereby right ventricular involvement can exacerbate the condition. However, the molecular composition of the left ventricular adult human myocardium relative to the right ventricle in health and in heart failure has yet to be thoroughly explored. 

Methods:
We performed unbiased quantitative mass spectrometry analyses on the myocardium of pre-mortem cryopreserved non-diseased human hearts to compare the proteome (n = 27) and metabolome (n = 25) between the normal left and right ventricles. We then characterised the proteome and metabolome of the left and right ventricles within end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 14 and 13) and ischaemic cardiomyopathy (n = 19-17), respectively. All analyses featured a mix of paired and unpaired samples. Intra-condition comparative analyses were performed to identify differences of molecular abundance between the ventricles, and intra-ventricular analyses were performed between sexes of non-diseased hearts. Novel and innovative techniques were used to merge datasets, increasing the sample size and statistical power. KEGG and Gene Ontology databases were used to perform enrichment analyses and inform metabolic trends.

Results:
Constituents of gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, lipogenesis, lipolysis, fatty acid catabolism, the citrate cycle and oxidative phosphorylation were down-regulated in the non-diseased left ventricle, while glycogenesis, pyruvate and ketone metabolism were up-regulated. Inter-ventricular significance of these metabolic pathways was then found to be diminished within end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy and ischaemic cardiomyopathy, while heart failure-associated pathways were increased in the left ventricle relative to the right within ischaemic cardiomyopathy, such as fluid sheer-stress, increased glutamine to glutamate ratio, and down-regulation of contractile proteins, indicating a left ventricular pathological bias.

Conclusions:
The inter-ventricular molecular analyses within this study aides to fill a critical gap in our understanding of the metabolic differences between the human left and right ventricular myocardium and may be used to inform future therapeutic targets for heart failure processes in one or both the ventricles."

Background
Register-based studies are common in sepsis epidemiology. Chart review is considered gold standard but is time consuming. This is one of few such studies.
Methods
In a 9-month prospective and consecutive study conducted in 2011-12, chart review was used to investigate outcomes in patients with severe sepsis, Sepsis-3 sepsis, and bacteremia in a population of 256,700 inhabitants in southwest Sweden. All adult patients aged ≥18 years admitted to hospital and given intravenous antibiotic treatment within 48 hours were evaluated, N=2,196. Cohort mortality was calculated up to 10 years after admission.
Results
Among 2,072 adults with any infection, 429 patients had severe sepsis of which 59 had septic shock. The 28-day case fatality rate (CFR) was 25%, 41% in those with septic shock. Sepsis-3 sepsis was diagnosed in 1,299 patients. The 28-day CFR was 12%. Among the 1,299, 393 also had severe sepsis. In 906 patients with Sepsis-3 sepsis but not severe sepsis, the 28-day CFR was 6%. For both sepsis definitions, the 28-day CFR increased 10-fold between the youngest and the oldest age groups. Age >75 years, and renal dysfunction were the strongest independent risk factors for 28-day case fatality. Bacteremia occurred in 283/2,072 (13%) patients. The 28-day CFR was 13% overall, 25% in severe sepsis and 4% in non-severe sepsis. Even 10 years after admission, the mortality rate was higher in sepsis patients by either definition.
Conclusions
The 28-day case fatality rate (CFR) in patients with Sepsis-3 sepsis, 12%, is the result of a large group of patients with a low 28-day CFR, 6%, camouflaging a group with severe sepsis and a high 28-day CFR, 25%. Age >75 years is an independent risk factor for case fatality. The 28-day CFR in patients with bacteremia is a function of severe sepsis, not bacteremia per se. Even after ten years, mortality is increased in both sepsis groups."

No analysis of the effect of this law on overdose mortality has fully accounted for the introduction of fentanyl to Oregon's unregulated drug market, a substance known to drive fatal overdose rates.

Objective: To evaluate whether the decriminalization of drug possession in Oregon was associated with changes in fatal drug overdose rates after accounting for the timing and spread of fentanyl through Oregon's unregulated drug market.

Design, Setting, and Participants: The association between fatal drug overdose and enactment of M110 in Oregon was analyzed using a matrix completion synthetic control method. The synthetic control unit was imputed from the 48 US states and Washington DC that did not decriminalize drugs. The rapid escalation of fentanyl in unregulated drug markets was determined using the state-level percentage of all samples reported to the National Forensic Laboratory Information System that were identified as fentanyl or its analogs. A changepoint analysis was used to determine when each state experienced a rapid escalation of fentanyl in its unregulated drug market. Mortality data were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2008-2022.

Exposures: M110 took effect on February 1, 2021.

Main Outcome: Fatal drug overdose rates per half-year.

Results: Analysis indicated a rapid escalation of fentanyl in Oregon's unregulated drug supply occurred in the first half of 2021, contemporaneous with the enactment of M110. The crude association between decriminalization and fatal overdose rate per 100,000 per half-year was significant (Tau = 1.83; SE = 0.39; p < 0.001); however, adjusting for the rapid escalation of fentanyl as a confounder, the effect of drug decriminalization on overdose mortality in Oregon was null (Tau = -0.51; SE = 0.36). Sensitivity analyses were consistent with this result.

Conclusions and Relevance: After adjusting for the rapid escalation of fentanyl, analysis found no association between M110 and fatal drug overdose rates. Future evaluations of the health effects of drug policies should account for confounding changes in the composition and potency of unregulated drug markets."

Objective: This study examines patterns of multiple sclerosis (MS) prevalence in 13,663 cohort members, including 4,821 patients with MS or suspected MS and 8,842 family members. 
Methods: We grouped participants into epidemiologic subgroups based on age of MS onset, clinical stage at diagnosis, symptom type at disease onset, sex, proband status, disability as measured by the EDSS, and ancestry based on reported ethnicity. 
Results: We observed a 2.7:1 MS prevalence ratio of women to men, though disease severity was greater for male patients. Variation in the age of disease onset between patients was only slightly associated with sex and strongly associated with disease type. Specific types of clinical symptoms at disease onset were associated with the prognosis. Regional residence did not correlate with disease onset, type, or severity. 
Conclusion: Population trends, as presented here, are not explained by environmental factors alone, highlighting the need for a comprehensive genetic analysis to understand disease variance across families."

Unfortunately, the rising cases of polymyxin-resistant strains from across the globe have adversely impacted their utility. While the molecular mechanisms responsible for developing polymyxin resistance (PolR) are largely understood, the prevalence of PolR strains in India has not been investigated systematically. The current study was undertaken to primarily determine the prevalence of PolR strains in India. Moreover, the extent of the spread of mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes among the GNB strains in India was also determined.
Method: A systematic search for articles using the relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria was performed in the applicable databases for the period January 2015 to December 2023. The included 41 studies were subjected to a meta-analysis using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (V.4). Publication biases were assessed using funnel plots and Eggers regression analysis.
Result: Considering a total of 41 studies including 24,589 bacterial isolates the present meta-analysis found the rate of PolR bacteria in India to be at 15.0% (95% CI: 11.2 to 19.8). Among the Indian States, Tamil Nadu topped with the highest prevalence of PolR at 28.3%. Investigating the contribution of the mcr genes, it was observed that among the PolR strains, 8.4% (95% CI: 4.8 to 14.3) were mcr positive.
Conclusion: The study determined the prevalence of PolR strains in India at 15.0% which is higher than that of the global average at 10%. The study also determined that 8.4% of the PolR strains carried the mcr genes. The mcr-positive strains reported from India could be an underestimation of the actual numbers due to the non-inclusion of mcr screening in many previous studies. This study provides insight into the state of the PolR situation in India, which may be useful to develop a monitoring strategy to contain the spread of such strains and preserve the efficacy of the polymyxins."

According to a report from the World Health Organization, traumatic brain injury (TBI) will surpass many diseases by 2020 and become the main cause of death and disability. Therefore, post-acute care (PAC) is immediately given active integrated care during the golden period of post-acute care to restore its function, which will reduce the medical expenses of subsequent rehospitalization.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of post-acute care for the patients with traumatic brain injury.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study that enrolled 168 patients over 18 years of age (inclusive) before and after PAC. The researcher collected the differences between the before and after receiving PAC collected about the Barthel Index (ADL), Lawton-Brody IADL Scale (IADL), and EuroQoL-5D(EQ-5D) by using purposive sampling. It was using machine learning and Power BI to analyze research results statistically.
Results
The results show that traumatic brain injury patients who received PAC rehabilitation had significant functional recovery effects(p<0.001). Additionally, the relationship between Barthel index, IADL and EQ-5D, the results show that when the Barthel index score is higher (r=1), the IADL score will also be higher (r=0.481**), showing a positive correlation. When the Barthel index score is higher (r=1), the EQ-5D score will be lower (r=-0.582**), showing a negative correlation. When the IADL score is higher (r=1), the Barthel index score will be higher (r=0.481**), showing a positive correlation, while the EQ-5D score will be lower (r=-0.496**), showing There is a negative correlation.
Conclusion
The results of this study confirm that PAC has essential effects. This result can be used as a reference for national planning health policies, cross-disciplinary professional design cases, and family PAC intervention plans to restore activity functions as soon as possible, improve the quality of life, and reduce the burden of family and social care.

Here, we leveraged large-scale genomic data including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), rare variant burden tests in exome sequencing studies (Exome), and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL), to prioritize potential therapeutic targets and identify opportunities for drug repositioning in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We found that prioritized genes covering two approved RA treatment targets (IL6R and CD86), and five targets tested in clinical trials for RA. Eighteen proteins were identified as having causalities with RA risk, three out of them showed strong support for colocalization. Bromodomain-containing protein 2 (BRD2) was nominated as one of the most promising candidates for clinical translation as its wide expression in joint synovial tissues and validation in observational analyses associating with RA incidence. Collectively, our systematic screening of candidate drug targets from different genetically informed approaches, and provided a comprehensive insight into therapeutic strategies for RA."

This progression of biomarkers has been condensed into the ATN framework, where each of the biomarkers can be either positive (+) or negative (-). Over the past decades genome wide association studies have implicated about 90 different loci involved with the development of late onset Alzheimer's disease. Here we investigate whether genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease contributes equally to the progression in different disease stages or whether it exhibits a stage-dependent effect.
Amyloid (A) and tau (T) status was defined using a combination of available PET and CSF biomarkers in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. In 312 participants with biomarker-confirmed A-T- status, we employed Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the contribution of APOE and polygenic risk scores (beyond APOE) to convert to A+T- status (65 conversions). Furthermore, we repeated the analysis in 290 participants with A+T- status and investigated the genetic contribution to conversion to A+T+ (45 conversions). Both survival analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and years of education.
For progression from A-T- to A+T-, APOE-e4 burden showed significant effect (HR=2.88; 95% CI: 1.70-4.89; P<0.001), while polygenic risk did not (HR=1.09; 95% CI: 0.84-1.42; P=0.53). Conversely, for the transition from A+T- to A+T+, the APOE-e4 burden contribution was reduced (HR=1.62 95% CI: 1.05-2.51; P=0.031), while the polygenic risk showed an increased contribution (HR=1.73; 95% CI:1.27-2.36; P<0.001). The marginal APOE effect was driven by e4 homozygotes (HR=2.58; 95% CI: 1.05-6.35; P=0.039) as opposed to e4 heterozygotes (HR=1.74; 95% CI: 0.87-3.49; P=0.12).
The genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease unfolds in a disease stage-dependent fashion. A better understanding of the interplay between disease stage and genetic risk can lead to a more mechanistic understanding of transition between ATN stages, a better understanding of the molecular processes leading to Alzheimer's disease as well as opening therapeutic windows for targeted interventions."

The present study was designed to identify a novel combinatorial miRNA therapy to address this unmet therapeutic need.METHODS We performed a combinatorial miRNA interference screen specifically targeting cardiac-predominant miRNAs regulating key aspects of cardiomyocyte mitotic induction to cell-cycle completion, including sarcomerogenesis, metabolic and cell-cycle control pathways. Cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac function were assessed in human cardiac biopsies, human cardiac tissue mimetics and in mouse disease models.RESULTS We identified combinatorial interference of miR-1a and miR-15b (LNA-1a/15b) as drivers of adult cardiomyocyte proliferation. Due to miR-1a/15b function on multiple processes modulating adult cardiomyocyte mitosis, its inhibition augmented adult cardiomyocyte cell-cycle completion and daughter cell formation, and improved contractility in in vitro 2D and 3D ischemic models, and in a mouse model of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Due to the cardiac-restricted pattern of miR-1a/15b expression, this strategy provides a feasible strategy for specific cardiomyocyte proliferative induction with minimal risk of neoplasm formation and off-target toxicity.CONCLUSIONS Combinatorial miR-1a/15b inhibition drives mitotic re-entry in adult cardiomyocytes and improves cardiac function in response to myocardial infarction. Our data provides a novel and clinically feasible LNA-based anti-miR-1a/15b strategy to attenuate heart failure and highlights an underutilized therapeutic strategy for simultaneous co-regulation of multiple disease pathways through combinatorial miRNA interference."

Radiological joint destruction was assessed using the modified van der Heijde total sharp score (mTSS).Results Among 109 (MMP-3(−), n = 63; MMP-3(+), n = 46) patients who achieved low disease activity or clinical remission (28 joint disease activity score erythrocyte sedimentation rate < 2.6), joint destruction (ΔmTSS ≥ 0.5) progressed in 24.6% and 48.9% of the MMP-3(−) and MMP-3(+) groups (p < 0.01), respectively. Prednisolone-induced increases in serum MMP-3 levels also resulted in joint destruction.Conclusion To prevent progressive joint destruction, the target MMP-3 value is 49.7 ng/mL in female patients, which is below the current MMP-3 cutoff value of 59.7 ng/mL. Residual MMP-3 activity may lead to the progression of joint destruction in patients with RA, even after CRP normalization by successful treatment with MTX."

Medical educators strive to improve their curricula to enhance the student learning experience. The use of high-fidelity simulation within basic and clinical medical science subjects has been one of these initiatives. However, there is paucity of evidence on using simulation for teaching pharmacology, and the effectiveness of this teaching modality, relative to more traditional ones, have not been sufficiently investigated. Accordingly, this study compares the effects of high-fidelity simulation, which is designed in alignment with adult and experiential learning theories, and traditional case-based tutorial sessions on the performance and perception of undergraduate Year 2 medical students in pharmacology in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Methods

This study employed a convergent mixed methods approach. Forty-nine medical students were randomly assigned to one of two groups during the 16-week pharmacology course. Each group underwent one session delivered via high-fidelity simulation and another via a case-based tutorial. A short multiple-choice question quiz was administered twice (immediately upon completion of the respective sessions and 5 weeks afterwards) to assess knowledge retention. Furthermore, to explore the students’ perceptions regarding the two modes of learning delivery (independently and in relation to each other), an evaluation survey was administered following the delivery of each session. Thereafter, the iterative joint display analysis was used to develop a holistic understanding of the effect of high-fidelity simulation in comparison to traditional case-based tutorial sessions on pharmacology learning in the context of the study.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in students’ knowledge retention between high-fidelity simulation and case-based tutorial sessions. Yet, students expressed a greater preference for high-fidelity simulation, describing the corresponding sessions as more varied, better at reinforcing learning, and closer to reality. As such, the meta-inferences led to expansion of the overall understanding around students’ satisfaction, to both confirmation and expansion of the systemic viewpoint around students’ preferences, and lastly to refinement in relation to the perspective around retained knowledge.

Conclusion

High-fidelity simulation was found to be as effective as case-based tutorial sessions in terms of students’ retention of knowledge. Nonetheless, students demonstrated a greater preference for high-fidelity simulation. The study advocates caution in adapting high-fidelity simulation, where careful appraisal can lend itself to identifying contexts where it is most effective.

Background: Palliative care is a recommended component of guideline-directed care for people with HF. However, optimal strategies to implement SPC within ambulatory settings are unknown. 
Methods: Following a positive deviance frame, we conducted a qualitative study comprising interviews with SPC and cardiology clinicians at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) with the highest number of ambulatory SPC consultations within the VA system among people with HF from 2021-2022. Clinicians were asked how they provided ambulatory SPC and what they felt were the necessary components, delivery characteristics, and implementation strategies of care delivery. Interviews were analyzed using content analysis. 

Results: We interviewed 14 SPC clinicians and 9 cardiology clinicians at seven national VAMCs; 43% were physicians 48% were advanced practice registered nurses/physician associates, and 10% were psychologists or social workers. Discussion of goals of care (e.g., prognosis, advance directives) and connecting patients/caregivers to resources (e.g., homecare) were essential components of ambulatory SPC provided at participating facilities. Clinicians preferred and used integrated (i.e., embedded) approaches to SPC delivery, employed standardized patient selection and referral procedures, and formalized procedures for handoffs to and from SPC. Necessary strategies to address barriers to ambulatory SPC implementation included deploying palliative champions, educating non-SPC clinicians on the value of ambulatory SPC for people with HF, and developing ambulatory models through leadership support. 

Conclusions/Implications: Facilitating the broader adoption of ambulatory SPC may be achieved by prioritizing these mutually valued and necessary features of delivery."

Parents are the most influential source of sexuality education to adolescent, yet adolescents lack sexuality education. The study explored barriers in parent-adolescent sexual-risk communication from both perspectives in Port-Harcourt LGA, Rivers State, Nigeria.Materials and Method A cross-sectional study design using explanatory sequential mixed methods approach was implemented. Three hundred and twenty nine in-school adolescents participated in the quantitative study and recruited using multi-stage sampling technique while 9 parents of adolescents and 16 adolescents participated in the qualitative study. A semi-structured administered questionnaire was used to elicit information from the adolescents while an FGD and IDI guide was used to elicit information from in-school adolescents and parents respectively. The qualitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics and chi-square while the qualitative data was subjected to thematic analysis.Results The mean age of the adolescents was 16.0±1.1 years and 55% were males. A quarter (21%) of the parents had never discussed sex with their adolescents. The barriers identified from the adolescents’ perspective were parental factors (parents being too busy, judgmental, low knowledge), individual factors (discomfort to initiate communication, lack of trust), religious and cultural factors. The barriers from the parents’ perspective were shame to initiate communication, fear of outcome, feeling children are too young and lack of accurate information.Conclusion The barriers to parent-adolescent communication featured interplay of parental, individual, cultural and religious factors. Parents should be trained to initiate timely and accurate sexuality education to the adolescent to curb adolescent risky sexual exploitations."

This systematic review and meta-analysis determined the prevalence of caries and identified the caries prevention behaviours among adolescents in Nigeria.Methods In August 2023, a literature search was conducted across PubMed, Google Scholar, Academic Info, Cochrane and Refseek databases to identify studies on dental caries prevalence and caries prevention behaviour among adolescents aged 10 to 19 years in Nigeria. Two reviewers used an independent and double-blind approach to extract data, with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 percentages, and a funnel plot was constructed to assess the potential for publication bias. The meta-analysis employed a random effects model to ascertain the prevalence of dental caries. Subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the variation in caries prevalence by sex. The review process followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework guidelines while the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist was used to critically appraise the quality and integrity of the included studies. Registration of this systematic review was completed on PROSPERO CRD42024458849.Results Sixteen studies met the eligibility criteria. The pooled caries prevalence among adolescents in Nigeria was 23.0% (95% CI: 16, 30) with a pooled prevalence of 16.0% (p < 0.00001, 95% CI: 9 - 23) for males, and a pooled prevalence of 22.0% (p < 0.00001, 95% CI= 11 - 32) for females. The commonest caries prevention practices reported were daily tooth brushing, use of fluoride containing toothpastes and dental service utilization. Factors associated with caries among adolescents were a history of dental service utilization, poor oral hygiene practices and consumption of refined carbohydrates in-between-meals.Conclusion The high prevalence of dental caries among adolescents in Nigeria warrants programmatic attention with an emphasis on improving oral hygiene practices and controlling the consumption of refined carbohydrates in-between-meals. Dental service utilization for caries prevention needs to be encouraged."

Children living with HIV have few second-line antiretroviral therapy(ART) options, especially fixed-dose-combinations(FDC). 
Methods
Children from Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe were randomised to second-line tenofovir alafenamide(TAF)/emtricitabine(FTC) or standard-of-care(SOC) backbone (abacavir(ABC) or zidovudine(ZDV) with lamivudine(3TC)) in the factorial CHAPAS-4 trial(ISRCTN22964075). The second randomisation (reported elsewhere) was to dolutegravir(DTG), ritonavir-boosted darunavir(DRV/r), atazanavir(ATV/r) or lopinavir(LPV/r) as anchor drug. All drugs were dosed using WHO weight-bands and children <25kg received a new paediatric TAF/FTC(15/120mg) FDC tablet. The primary endpoint was viral load(VL)<400copies/ml at week-96, analysed using logistic regression, hypothesising that TAF/FTC would be non-inferior to SOC (10% margin). Secondary endpoints included safety and immunological outcomes. Analyses were intention-to-treat. 
Results
919 children 3-15years, 497(54%) male, median[IQR] baseline viral load(VL) 17,573copies/ml [5549-55,700] and CD4 count 669cells/mm3[413-971], spent 99% of time on allocated NRTI backbone. At week-96, 406/454(89.4%) receiving TAF/FTC vs. 378/454(83.3%) receiving SOC had VL<400copies/mL (adjusted difference[95%CI]: 6.3%[2.0%,10.6%], p=0.004), with no evidence that this varied by ABC/3TC or ZDV/3TC SOC. CD4 count improved similarly in both arms. Growth was better with TAF/FTC vs. SOC, without evidence of excess weight-gain with any backbone/anchor drug combination (including DTG +/- TAF/FTC, interaction p=0.51). Bone health parameters were similar between arms, irrespective of anchor drug. One child died (treatment-unrelated); 29(3%) had serious adverse events without differences between arms.
Conclusions
TAF/FTC was virologically superior to SOC ZDV/3TC or ABC/3TC with a favourable safety profile, irrespective of anchor drug. Development of child-friendly TAF/FTC FDCs (+/- anchor drug) would increase cost-effective ART options for children and reduce drug access gaps between children and adults."

Despite the deleterious consequences of SNS overactivity, there are very few therapeutic options available to combat sympathetic overactivity.Aim To evaluate the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on SNS activity in CKD patients.Method Participants with CKD stages III-IV were randomized to an 8-week MBSR program or Health Education Program (HEP; a structurally parallel, active control group). Primary outcomes were direct intraneural measures of SNS activity directed to muscle (MSNA) via microneurography at rest and during stress maneuvers.Results 28 participants (63 ±9 years; 86% males) completed the intervention with 16 in MBSR and 12 in HEP. There was a significant Group (MBSR vs. HEP) by Time (baseline vs. post-intervention) interaction in the change in MSNA reactivity to mental stress (p=0.026), with a significant reduction in the mean change in MSNA over 3 minutes of mental arithmetic at post-intervention (10.6 ± 7.1 to 5.0 ± 5.7 bursts/min, p<0.001), while no change was observed within the HEP group (p=0.773).Conclusions In this randomized controlled trial, patients with CKD had an amelioration of sympathetic reactivity during mental stress following 8-weeks of MBSR but not after HEP. Our findings demonstrate that mindfulness training is feasible and may have clinically beneficial effects on autonomic function in CKD."

This manuscript describes an update of the 2018 Chicago Consensus Guidelines addressing the management of GCPM in line with most recent evidence.Methods A clinical management pathway was updated through two rounds of a Delphi Consensus to assess agreement levels with pathway blocks. Supporting evidence underwent evaluation via a rapid literature review. Meta-analyses were performed where appropriate.Results Overall, level of evidence in this disease subset was low to moderate. Of 124 participants in the first round, 109 (88%) responded in the second round. Strong consensus (>90%) was achieved in 6/8 (75%) blocks in round I and II. A multidisciplinary preoperative assessment and diagnostic laparoscopy should be offered all patients, while patients with a high burden of disease or progression should undergo non-surgical management. Patients with stable/responsive disease and low peritoneal carcinomatosis index should subsequently be offered treatment with regional therapeutic interventions and cytoreductive surgery. In patients who are cytology positive, systemic therapy can be used to convert these patients to cytology negative, with subsequent surgery offered per the patient’s goals of care. Meta-analysis of observational and randomized control trials revealed a survival benefit with the addition of intraperitoneal chemotherapy to cytoreductive surgery (HR 0.52).Conclusion The consensus-driven clinical pathway for GCPMs offers vital clinical guidance for practitioners. There is a growing body of high-quality evidence to support management strategies and future clinical trials are eagerly awaited."

We aimed to develop a proteomic aging clock (PAC) for all-cause mortality risk as a proxy of biological age. Data were from the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project, including 53,021 participants aged between 39 and 70 years and 2,923 plasma proteins assessed using the Olink Explore 3072 assay®. The Spearman correlation between PAC proteomic age and chronological age was 0.77. A total of 10.9% of the participants died during a mean follow-up of 13.3 years, with the mean age at death 70.1 years. We developed a proteomic aging clock (PAC) for all-cause mortality risk as a surrogate of BA using a combination of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized Cox regression and Gompertz proportional hazards models. PAC showed robust age-adjusted associations and predictions for all-cause mortality and the onset of various diseases in general and disease-free participants. The proteins associated with PAC were enriched in several processes related to the hallmarks of biological aging. Our results expand previous findings by showing that age acceleration, based on PAC, strongly predicts all-cause mortality and several incident disease outcomes. Particularly, it facilitates the evaluation of risk for multiple conditions in a disease-free population, thereby, contributing to the prevention of initial diseases, which vary among individuals and may subsequently lead to additional comorbidities."

We conducted a survey of when to intubate patients with AHRF to measure the influence of clinical variables on intubation decision-making and quantify variability.Methods We developed an anonymous factorial vignette-based web survey to ask clinicians involved in the decision to intubate “Would you recommend intubation?” Respondents selected an ordinal recommendation from a 5-point scale ranging from “Definite no” to “Definite yes” for up to 10 randomly allocated vignettes. We disseminated the survey through clinical and academic societies, analyzed responses using Bayesian proportional odds modeling with clustering by individual, country, and region, and reported mean odds ratios (OR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI).Results Between September 2023 and January 2024, 2,294 respondents entered 17,235 vignette responses in 74 countries [most common: Canada (29%), USA (26%), France (9%), Japan (8%), and Thailand (5%)]. Respondents were attending physicians (63%), nurses (13%), trainee physicians (9%), respiratory therapists (9%), other (6%). Lower oxygen saturation, higher inspired oxygen fraction, non-invasive ventilation compared to high-flow, tachypnea, neck muscle use, abdominal paradox, drowsiness, and inability to obey were associated with increased odds of intubation; diagnosis, vasopressors, and duration of symptoms were not. Within a country the odds of recommending intubation changed between clinicians by an average factor of 2.60, while changing between countries within a region changed it by 1.56.Conclusion In this international, interprofessional survey of more than 2000 practicing clinicians, intubation for patients with AHRF was mostly decided based on oxygenation, breathing pattern, and consciousness, but there was important variation across individuals and countries."

This study evaluates the performance of commercial anti-DENV IgG tests to identify tests that could be used for pre-vaccination screening. First, for 7 tests, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity in early convalescent dengue virus (DENV) infection, using 44 samples collected 7-30 days after symptom onset and confirmed by RT-PCR. Next, for the 5 best performing tests and two additional tests (with and without an external test reader) that became available later, we evaluated performance to detect past dengue infection among a panel of 44 specimens collected in 2018-2019 from healthy 9-16-year-old children from Puerto Rico. Finally, a full-scale evaluation was done with the 4 best performing tests using 400 specimens from the same population. We used virus focus reduction neutralization test and an in-house DENV IgG ELISA as reference standards.Of seven tests, five showed ≥75% sensitivity detecting anti-DENV IgG in early convalescent specimens with low cross-reactivity to Zika virus. For the detection of previous DENV infections the tests with the highest performance were the Euroimmun NS1 IgG ELISA (sensitivity 84.5%, specificity 97.1%) and CTK Dengue IgG rapid test R0065C with the test reader (sensitivity 76.2% specificity 98.1%). There are IgG tests available that can be used to accurately classify individuals with previous DENV infection as eligible for dengue vaccination to support safe vaccine implementation."

Here we describe complications of BPA based on the new definitions.All patients with CTEPH who completed BPA treatment before September 15th, 2023, were selected from the CTEPH database. Peri-procedural complications were collected and classified according to the 2023 consensus paper on BPA treatment. Complications were analyzed in subgroups of patients with pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≤ or > 6.6 WU and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) ≤ or > 45 mmHg at first BPA.In this analysis, 87 patients (63% women; mean age 61.1±14.0 years; 62% on dual PH targeted medical therapy) underwent 426 (mean 4.9±1.6 per patient) BPAs. Only non-severe complications occurred in 14% of BPA treatments; in 47% of the patients; 31% patients had a thoracic complication. The thoracic complications were mild (71%) or moderate (29%). Patients with a PVR >6.6 WU (n=8) underwent more BPA treatments (6.6±1.5 versus 4.6±1.5, p=0.002), had more complications (88% versus 41% of patients, p=0.020), and more thoracic complications (17% vs 7% of BPAs, p=0.013) than patients with PVR ≤6.6 WU. Patients with mPAP >45 mmHg (n=13) also had more BPA-treatments (6.5±1.7 versus 4.6±1.4, p<0.001), more complications (77% versus 44% of patients, p=0.027) and more thoracic complications (14% versus 8% of BPAs, p=0.039) than patients with mPAP ≤45 mmHg.Complications occurred in 14% of BPAs and were mostly mild. Patients with severe pulmonary hemodynamics suffered more (thoracic) complications.What is known?BPA is an effective treatment in improving pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with CTEPH.BPAs are associated with a high complication rate.In 2023 a consensus statement was published concerning the definition of complications of BPAs.Patients with poor pulmonary hemodynamics may be more susceptible to suffer from complications.What does this study add?For the first time, complications are categorized according to the consensus statement on BPA treatments in patients with CTEPH.Thoracic complication rates in patients with severe pulmonary hemodynamics are significantly higher compared to complication rates in patients with lower pulmonary hemodynamic values."

A deep learning model, SCIseg, was trained in a three-phase process involving active learning for the automatic segmentation of intramedullary SCI lesions and the spinal cord. The data consisted of T2-weighted MRI acquired using different scanner manufacturers with heterogeneous image resolutions (isotropic/anisotropic), orientations (axial/sagittal), lesion etiologies (traumatic/ischemic/hemorrhagic) and lesions spread across the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. The segmentations from the proposed model were visually and quantitatively compared with other open-source baselines. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare quantitative MRI biomarkers (lesion volume, lesion length, and maximal axial damage ratio) computed from manual lesion masks and those obtained automatically with SCIseg predictions.Results MRI data from 191 SCI patients (mean age, 48.1 years ± 17.9 [SD]; 142 males) were used for model training and evaluation. SCIseg achieved the best segmentation performance for both the cord and lesions. There was no statistically significant difference between lesion length and maximal axial damage ratio computed from manually annotated lesions and those obtained using SCIseg.Conclusion Automatic segmentation of intramedullary lesions commonly seen in SCI replaces the tedious manual annotation process and enables the extraction of relevant lesion morphometrics in large cohorts. The proposed model segments lesions across different etiologies, scanner manufacturers, and heterogeneous image resolutions. SCIseg is open-source and accessible through the Spinal Cord Toolbox.Summary Automatic segmentation of the spinal cord and T2-weighted lesions in spinal cord injury on MRI scans across different treatment strategies, lesion etiologies, sites, scanner manufacturers, and heterogeneous image resolutions.Key ResultsAn open-source, automatic method, SCIseg, was trained and evaluated on a dataset of 191 spinal cord injury patients from three sites for the segmentation of the spinal cord and T2-weighted lesions.SCIseg generalizes across traumatic and non-traumatic lesions, scanner manufacturers, and heterogeneous image resolutions, enabling the automatic extraction of lesion morphometrics in large multi-site cohorts.Quantitative MRI biomarkers, namely, lesion length and maximal axial damage ratio derived from the automatic predictions showed no statistically significant difference when compared with manual ground truth, implying reliability in SCIseg’s predictions."

This success sparked interest in extending this strategy to GWAS of rare and common diseases using existing cases and external controls. However, heterogeneous genotyping data can cause spurious results. To harmonize data, we propose a new method, two-stage imputation (TSIM), where cohorts are imputed separately, merged on intersecting high-quality variants, and imputed again. We show that TSIM minimizes cohort-specific bias while controlling imputation-derived errors. Merging arthritis cases and UK Biobank controls using TSIM, we replicated known associations without introducing false positives. Furthermore, GWAS using TSIM performed comparably to the meta-analysis of nephrotic syndrome cohorts genotyped on five different platforms, demonstrating TSIM’s ability to harmonize heterogeneous genotyping data. With the plethora of publicly available genotypes, TSIM provides a GWAS framework that harmonizes heterogeneous data, enabling analysis of small and case-only cohorts."

We calculated GenePy2.0–a burden score of target regions integrating variants with CADDPhred>15 weighted by deleteriousness and zygosity. Collating with other burden-based test, GenePy-based Mann-Whitney-U tests on cases/controls with varying extreme scores were used. Significance-levels and effect sizes were used for tuning the optimal GenePy thresholds for discriminating patients from controls. Individual’s binarized GenePy status (above or below threshold) of candidate regions, was subject to itemset association test via the sparse Apriori algorithm.Results A tailored IBD cohort was curated (nCrohn’s_Disease(CD)=891, nUlcerative_Colitis(UC)=1409, nControls=60118). Analysing 885 unified target regions (794 GWAS loci and 104 monogenic genes with 13 overlaps), the GenePy approach detected statistical significance (permutation p<5.65×10-5) in 35 regions of CD and 25 of UC targets exerting risk and protective effects on the disease. Large effect sizes were observed, e.g. CYLD-AS1 (Mann-Whitney-□=0.89[CI:0.78-0.96]) in CD/controls with the top 1% highest scores of the gene. Itemset association learning further highlighted an intriguing signal whereby GenePy status of IL23R and NOD2 were mutually exclusive in CD but always co-occurring in controls.Conclusion GenePy score per IBD patient detected ‘deleterious’ variation of large effect underpinning known IBD associations and proved itself a promising tool for genomic biomarker discovery.What is already known on this topic Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a genetically heterogeneous disease with both common polygenic, and rare monogenic, presentations. Previous studies have identified known genetic variants associated with disease.What this study adds A genomic biomarker tool, tailored for large cohort, GenePy2.0 is developed. It’s rank-based test is more powerful than mutation-burden based test in validating known associations and finding new associations of IBD. We identified large risk and protective effects of ‘pathogenic genes/loci’ in IBD, including expanding previous associations to wider genomic regions.How this study might affect research, practice or policy GenePy2.0 facilitates analysis of diseases with genetic heterogeneity and facilitates personalised genomic analysis on patients. The revealed genetic landscape of IBD captures both risk and protective effects of rare ‘pathogenic’ variants, alongside more common variation. This, could provide a fresh angle for future targeted therapies in specific groups of patients."

Patients chose between pairs of experimentally designed, hypothetical PMs that varied according to PM type (removable leadless, non-removable leadless, conventional transvenous); battery life (5, 8, 12, 15 years); time since regulatory approval (2, 10 years); discomfort for 6 months (none, discomfort); complication risk and infection risk (1%, 5%, 10%/20% for each). Patients with a de-novo pacemaker indication were recruited to complete a web-based survey from seven US sites between May 11, 2022 to May 24, 2023.Results Choice data from 117 patients indicated that complication risks and infection risks were the most influential. On average, patients preferred removable leadless pacemakers over both non-removable leadless pacemakers (p=0.001) and conventional transvenous pacemakers (p=0.031). However, latent-class analysis revealed two distinct preference classes. One class preferred leadless pacemakers (50.5%) and the other class preferred conventional transvenous pacemakers (49.5%). The conventional PM class prioritized pacemakers with ten rather than two years since regulatory approval (p<0.001) whereas the leadless PM class was insensitive to years since regulatory approval (p=0.83). All else equal, patients would accept maximum risks of complications or infections ranging about 5% to 18% to receive their preferred pacemaker type.Conclusion Latent-class analysis revealed strong patient preferences for the type of PM, with a nearly equal split between recent leadless PM technology and conventional transvenous PMs.These findings can inform shared decision making between healthcare providers and patients."

To address this gap, we developed and validated the Nova Food Frequency Questionnaire (NovaFFQ) for Brazilian adults. The NovaFFQ includes commonly consumed foods and drinks based on 2017-2018 National Food Survey data. Reproducibility was assessed by comparing NovaFFQ estimates on two occasions. Criterion validity was assessed by comparing the mean dietary contribution of Nova groups obtained from the first NovaFFQ against two Nova24h. Strong reproducibility was observed with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.91 for all Nova groups. Criterion validity showed a moderate ICC, ranging from 0.61 to 0.65, and substantial agreement in ranking individuals, as indicated by prevalence and bias-adjusted kappa, ranging from 0.70 to 0.74. The NovaFFQ is a valid instrument for assessing food consumption according to food processing."

This project utilized large language models (LLMs) to develop lexicons for OSA sub-phenotypes. Our study found that LLMs can identify informative lexicons for OSA sub-phenotyping in simple patient cohorts, achieving wAUC scores of 0.9 or slightly higher. Among the six models studied, BioClinical BERT and BlueBERT outperformed the rest. Additionally, the developed lexicons exhibited some utility in predicting mortality risk (wAUC score of 0.86) and hospital readmission (wAUC score of 0.72).

This study aims to investigate the impact of CHD on functional brain network connectivity and cognitive function. Using resting-state fMRI data, we examined several network metrics across various brain regions utilizing weighted networks and binarized networks with both absolute and proportional thresholds. Regression models were fitted to patient neurocognitive exam scores using various metrics obtained from all three methods. Our results unveil significant differences in network connectivity patterns, particularly in temporal, occipital, and subcortical regions, across both weighted and binarized networks. Furthermore, we identified distinct correlations between network metrics and cognitive performance, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms within specific brain regions."

Most PRS methods assume that mutation effects scale linearly with the number of alleles and are constant across individuals. While these assumptions simplify computation, they increase error, particularly for less-represented racial groups. We developed and provide Delphi (deep learning for phenotype inference), a deep-learning method that relaxes these assumptions to produce more predictive PRS. In contrast to other methods, Delphi can integrate up to hundreds of thousands of SNPs as input. We compare our results to a standard, linear PRS model, lasso regression, and a gradient-boosted trees-based method. We show that deep learning can be an effective approach to genetic risk prediction. We report a relative increase in the percentage variance explained compared to the state-of-the-art by 11.4% for body mass index, 18.9% for systolic blood pressure, 7.5% for LDL, 35% for C-reactive protein, 16.2% for height, 29.6 % for pulse rate; in addition, Delphi provides 2% absolute explained variance for blood glucose while other tested methods were non-predictive. Furthermore, we show that Delphi tends to increase the weight of high-effect mutations. This work demonstrates an effective deep learning method for modeling genetic risk that also showed to generalize well when evaluated on individuals from non-European ancestries."

At the same time, the risk of dementia increases around menopause and it stands to reason that estradiol (or the lack thereof) plays a significant role for the development of dementia and other age-related neuropathologies. Here we investigated if there is a link between brain aging and estradiol-associated events, such as menarche and menopause. For this purpose, we applied a well-validated machine learning approach in a sample of 1,006 postmenopausal women who were scanned twice approximately two years apart. We observed less brain aging in women with an earlier menarche, a later menopause, and a longer reproductive span (i.e., the time interval between menarche and menopause). These effects were evident both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, which supports the notion that estradiol might contribute to brain preservation. However, more research is required as effects were small and no direct measures of estradiol were obtained in the current study."

Prediction is challenging in rare and heterogeneous diseases, such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA), that have varying clinical manifestations. We aimed to determine the characteristics of those who will benefit most from transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) using a novel heterogeneity and group identification analysis.Methods We compared the predictive ability of demographic and clinical patient characteristics (e.g., PPA variant and disease progression, baseline language performance) vs. functional connectivity alone (from resting-state fMRI) in the same cohort.Results Functional connectivity alone had the highest predictive value for outcomes, explaining 62% and 75% of tDCS effect of variance in generalization (semantic fluency) and in the trained outcome of the clinical trial (written naming), contrasted with <15% predicted by clinical characteristics, including baseline language performance. Patients with higher baseline functional connectivity between the left IFG (opercularis and triangularis), and between the middle temporal pole and posterior superior temporal gyrus, were most likely to benefit from tDCS.Conclusions We show the importance of a baseline 7-minute functional connectivity scan in predicting tDCS outcomes, and point towards a precision medicine approach in neuromodulation studies. The study has important implications for clinical trials and practice, providing a statistical method that addresses heterogeneity in patient populations and allowing accurate prediction and enrollment of those who will most likely benefit from specific interventions."

Interindividual variability of brain activity is a source of heterogeneity in this disorder. Here, we aimed at analyzing dynamical reconfiguration of brain activity, using the neural fingerprint approach, to delineate subject-specific characteristics and their cognitive correlates in TLE.Methods We collected 10 minutes of resting state electroencephalography (128 channels), free from epileptiform activity, from 68 TLE patients and 34 healthy controls. The functional network was defined by the spatio-temporal spreading, across cortical regions, of aperiodic bursts of activations (neuronal avalanches). This metric allowed encapsulating brain reconfiguration patterns into the avalanche transition matrix (ATM). We used a neural fingerprint approach to differentiate across controls and patients diagnosis, linking altered brain dynamic with cognitive outcome.Findings Patients’ brain dynamics were more stereotyped as compared to controls. The neural fingerprint using ATMs differentiated, in a data-driven fashion, patients with respect to healthy controls, being sensitive not only to the pathology but also to the subtype (unilateral vs. bilateral TLE). Notably, in unilateral TLE patients, a better memory performance was associated with a larger similarity of the brain dynamic configuration with controls.Interpretation TLE is characterized by reduced variability and more stereotyped brain dynamics, implicating widespread alterations across the brain. These alterations correlate with cognitive function in patients with unilateral TLE. This study underscores the utility of brain fingerprinting in elucidating disease-specific brain dynamics, offering novel metrics for personalized patient care."

Increased CSF volumes are frequently observed in congenital heart disease (CHD) and are associated with neurodevelopmental deficits. This suggests prolonged perturbation to the CSF system and possible interference to its homeostatic function, which may contribute to the neurodevelopmental deficits in CHD. CSF flow has yet to be studied in CHD patients, but the pulsatile flow of CSF throughout the brain is driven mainly by cardiopulmonary circulation. Given the underlying heart defects in CHD, the cardiopulmonary circulatory mechanisms in CHD might be impaired with resultant perturbation on the CSF circulation. In this study, we determine whether CSF flow, using MRI measurements of static and dynamic pulsatile flow, is abnormal in youths with CHD compared to healthy controls in relation to executive cognitive function. CSF flow measurements were obtained on a total of 58 child and young adult participants (CHD=20, healthy controls = 38). The CSF flow was measured across the lumen of the Aqueduct of Sylvius using cardiac-gated phase-contrast MRI at 3.0T. Static pulsatility was characterized as anterograde and retrograde peak velocities, mean velocity, velocity variance measurements, and dynamic pulsatility calculated as each participant’s CSF flow deviation from the study cohort’s consensus flow measured with root mean squared deviation (RMSD) were obtained. The participants had neurocognitive assessments for executive function with focus on inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and working memory domains. The CHD group demonstrated greater dynamic pulsatility (higher overall flow RMSD over the entire CSF flow cycle) compared to controls (p=0.0353), with no difference detected in static pulsatility measures. However, lower static CSF flow pulsatility (anterograde peak velocity: p=0.0323) and lower dynamic CSF flow pulsatility (RMSD: p=0.0181) predicted poor inhibitory executive function outcome. Taken together, while the whole CHD group exhibited higher dynamic CSF flow pulsatility compared to controls, the subset of CHD subjects with relatively reduced static and dynamic CSF flow pulsatility had the worst executive functioning, specifically the inhibition domain. These findings suggest that altered CSF flow pulsatility may be central to not only brain compensatory mechanisms but can also drive cognitive impairment in CHD. Further studies are needed to investigate possible mechanistic etiologies of aberrant CSF pulsatility (i.e. primary cardiac hemodynamic disturbances, intrinsic brain vascular stiffness, altered visco-elastic properties of tissue, or glial-lymphatic disturbances), which can result in acquired small vessel brain injury (including microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities)."

This study aims to investigate the clinical outcomes of PM for non-primary lung cancer.Methods A systematic search for meta-analyses on PM for non-primary lung cancers was conducted, encompassing publications up to January 3, 2024. The analysis included seven primary cancer types: renal cell, breast, adrenocortical, head and neck cancers, melanoma, germ cell tumors, and sarcoma. Primary outcomes, overall survival, and recurrence rates post-PM were assessed using random-effect models to account for study heterogeneity.Results This study included 16 systematic-review articles and 101 individual studies, involving 10,277 patients who underwent PM for non-primary lung cancer. Patients had a mean age of 48.0 years, with 68.4% being male. About half of the patients(47.1% [95%CI 40.8-53.5] presented with multiple metastatic lesions, and complete R0 resection achieved in 87.2% [95%CI 83.0-90.8]. The pooled 5-year overall survival (OS) rate post-PM was 41.2% [95%CI, 37.1-45.4%]. Patients with germ cell tumors demonstrated significantly higher survival rate than other cancers(p<0.05), while patients with melanoma exhibited the poorest outcome(p<0.05). During follow-up, 57.6%[95%CI 46.4-68.1] had recurrence; 48% of them had intrathoracic-only recurrence and 52% had extra-thoracic recurrence.Conclusion This study underscores the survival benefits associated with PM. Overall survival rates following PM do not significantly differ based on primary cancer types, except for germ cell tumors and melanoma. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing and incorporating PM into clinical practice when appropriate.Synopsis Surgical resection for pulmonary metastasis from cancers other than lung cancer still holds a significant role in improving a patient’s prognosis. Though the recurrence rate is high, it could improve the chance of survival regardless of the primary cancer types."

Biomarkers for the classification and the prediction of chronic pain are therefore critically needed. In this multi-dataset study of over 523,000 participants, we applied machine learning to multi-dimensional biological data from the UK Biobank to identify biomarkers for 35 medical conditions associated with pain (e.g., clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, stroke, gout, etc.) or self-reported chronic pain (e.g., back pain, knee pain, etc). Biomarkers derived from blood immunoassays, brain and bone imaging, and genetics were effective in predicting medical conditions associated with chronic pain (area under the curve (AUC) 0.62-0.87) but not self-reported pain (AUC 0.50-0.62). Among the biomarkers identified was a composite blood-based signature that predicted the onset of various medical conditions approximately nine years in advance (AUC 0.59-0.72). Notably, all biomarkers worked in synergy with psychosocial factors, accurately predicting both medical conditions (AUC 0.69– 0.91) and self-report pain (AUC 0.71–0.92). Over a period of 15 years, individuals scoring high on both biomarkers and psychosocial risk factors had twice the cumulative incidence of diagnoses for pain-associated medical conditions (Hazard Ratio (HR): 2.26) compared to individuals scoring high on biomarkers but low on psychosocial risk factors (HR: 1.06). In summary, we identified various biomarkers for chronic pain conditions and showed that their predictive efficacy heavily depended on psychological and social influences. These findings underscore the necessity of adopting a holistic approach in the development of biomarkers to enhance their clinical utility."

Risks of critical medical support requirements, thrombosis events, and death were valued in the multivariate logistic regression models, where age (≥ 80 vs. < 80 years old), nadir platelets level (≤100 vs. > 100 10^9/L), C-reactive protein (CRP) level at admission (≥ 80 vs. < 80 mg/L), D-dimer level at admission (≥ 1.0 vs. < 1.0 mg/L) were dichotomized.Results A total of 88 patients were included (median age 77 years, 72% male). During hospitalization, 35 (40%) patients required critical medical support, 22 (29%) had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), 11 (13%) had radiologically supported thrombosis events, and 26 (30%) died. Increased age (odds ratio [OR]: 5.22,95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-21.53; p=0.02), elevated CRP levels (OR: 9.26, 95% CI: 2.24-38.37; p<0.01), decreased nadir platelet level (OR: 13.47, 95% CI: 1.91-94.84; p<0.01), elevated D-dimer level (OR: 5.21, 95 CI%: 0.96-28.21; p=0.06) were associated with the requirements of critical care. Increased age (OR: 10.87, 95% CI: 3.05-38.80; p<0.01), elevated CRP levels (OR: 6.14, 95% CI:1.68-22.47; p<0.01), decreased nadir platelet levels (OR: 5.96, 95% CI: 1.34-26.47; p=0.02) and D-dimers (≥1.0 vs. <1.0 mg/L, OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 0.68-7.44; p=0.18) were associated with death. Increased age (OR: 2.40,95% CI: 0.60-9.67; p=0.22), decreased nadir platelet levels (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 0.22-7.96; p=0.77), inflmmation status, including D-dimers (≥1.0 vs. <1.0 mg/L, OR:4.62, 95% CI: 0.89-24.04; p=0.07) and CRP (≥80 vs. <80 mg/mL, OR:5.44, 95% CI: 1.05-28.27; p=0.04) were significantly associated with the risks of thromboembolism.Conclusions The retrospective study indicated thromboinflammation promoted thromboembolism and was associated with the outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia."

The effectiveness of FB-HIVST remains uncertain; thus, we conducted a review to assess the risk and benefits of FB-HIVST to inform global guidance. We searched across nine electronic databases covering the period up to February 01, 2022, and included publications that directly compared FB-HIVST to standard HIV testing services (SOC) or no intervention. Meta-analysis was conducted on comparable outcomes using random-effects model for relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals. Other outcomes were summarized descriptively. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane’s Risk of Bias tool. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). After screening 2,203 articles, 11 studies were found eligible, including 4 randomized controlled trials (RCT), 2 cohort studies, 3 economic evaluations, and 2 qualitative studies. Meta-analyses of four RCTs demonstrated that FB-HIVST may increase testing uptake (RR=2.47; 95% CI= 0.96, 6.33) and may lead to greater HIV diagnosis (RR=3.77; 95% CI=0.81, 17.44). Overall GRADE certainty was low. Trials found FB-HIVST as acceptable and feasible to many users, with minimal risk of social harm. A single RCT reported on linkage to care and observed that, among total enrolled, FB-HIVST compared to SOC may increase linkage to care threefold (RR= 3.26; 95% CI: 0.68, 15.62; low-certainty evidence). FB-HIVST was found to be cost-effective in a high-burden outpatient department, but determined to be quite variable. FB-HIVST is safe and may be an effective method to increase testing coverage and the diagnoses, particularly in high-burden HIV settings or sites with limited staff and resources. Findings from this review informed WHO’S guideline development process and its recommendation that FB-HIVST be offered as an additional testing option at facilities.PROSPERO Number: CRD42022302619"

Because comprehensive, in vivo functional assessment of all possible genetic variants is infeasible, clinicians instead consider in silico variant pathogenicity predictions to distinguish plausibly disease-causing from benign variants across the genome. However, in the most difficult undiagnosed cases, such as those accepted to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), existing pathogenicity predictions cannot reliably discern true etiological variant(s) from other deleterious candidate variants that were prioritized through N-of-1 efforts. Pinpointing the disease-causing variant from a pool of plausible candidates remains a largely manual effort requiring extensive clinical workups, functional and experimental assays, and eventual identification of genotype- and phenotype-matched individuals. Here, we introduce VarPPUD, a tool trained on prioritized variants from UDN cases, that leverages gene-, amino acid-, and nucleotide-level features to discern pathogenic variants from other deleterious variants that are unlikely to be confirmed as disease relevant. VarPPUD achieves a cross-validated accuracy of 79.3% and precision of 77.5% on a held-out subset of uniquely challenging UDN cases, respectively representing an average 18.6% and 23.4% improvement over nine traditional pathogenicity prediction approaches on this task. We validate VarPPUD’s ability to discriminate likely from unlikely pathogenic variants on synthetic, GAN-generated candidate variants as well. Finally, we show how VarPPUD can be probed to evaluate each input feature’s importance and contribution toward prediction—an essential step toward understanding the distinct characteristics of newly-uncovered disease-causing variants.Significance Statement Patients with chronic, undiagnosed and underdiagnosed genetic conditions often endure expensive and excruciating years-long diagnostic odysseys without clear results. In many instances, clinical genome sequencing of patients and their family members fails to reveal known disease-causing variants, although compelling variants of uncertain significance are frequently encountered. Existing computational tools struggle to reliably differentiate truly disease-causing variants from other plausible candidate variants within these prioritized sets. Consequently, the confirmation of disease-causing variants often necessitates extensive experimental follow-up, including studies in model organisms and identification of other similarly presenting genotype-matched individuals, a process that can extend for several years. Here, we present VarPPUD, a tool trained specifically to distinguish likely from unlikely to be confirmed pathogenic variants that were prioritized across cases in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. By evaluating the importance and impact of different input feature values on prediction, we gain deeper insights into the distinctive attributes of difficult-to-identify diagnostic variants. For patients who remain undiagnosed following comprehensive whole genome sequencing, our new method VarPPUD may reveal pathogenic variants amid a pool of candidate variants, thereby advancing diagnostic efforts where progress has otherwise stalled."

Phase 2A determines the highest safe and well-tolerated dose of benfotiamine to be carried forward to phase 2B. During phase 2A, real-time monitoring of pre-defined safety stopping criteria in the first approximately 150 enrollees will help determine which dose (600 mg or 1200 mg) will be carried forward into phase 2B. The phase 2A primary analysis will test whether the rate of tolerability events (TEs) is unacceptably high in the high-dose arm compared to placebo. The primary safety endpoint in phase 2A is the rate of TEs compared between active and placebo arms, at each dose. The completion of phase 2A will seamlessly transition to phase 2B without pausing or stopping the trial. Phase 2B will assess efficacy and longer-term safety of benfotiamine in a larger group of participants through 72 weeks of treatment, at the selected dose. The co-primary efficacy endpoints in phase 2B are CDR-Sum of Boxes and ADAS-Cog13. Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability measures; pharmacokinetic measures of thiamine and its esters, erythrocyte transketolase activity as blood markers of efficacy of drug delivery; ADCS-ADL-MCI; and MoCA.Conclusion The BenfoTeam trial utilizes an innovative seamless phase 2A-2B design to achieve proof of concept. It includes an adaptive dose decision rule, thus optimizing exposure to the highest and best-tolerated dose.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06223360, registered on January 25, 2024."

The use of intrawound antibiotics for the prevention of SSIs after spine surgery is a controversial method.Objective To conduct a review of the current literature on the use of antibiotics in wound care and evaluate their effectiveness in preventing postoperative SSIs.Methods Keywords such as “spinal surgery” or “spine”, “antibiotics”, “local” or “topical”, “prevention of infection”, and “infection” were used based on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Embase database. The literature was screened based on the title, abstract, full text reading, and extraction of relevant research data. Comparisons of the data were performed using RevMan 5.3 software.Results A total of 18922 patients from 24 studies were included in the final analysis, 8878 patients received antibiotics (experimental group) to prevent SSIs, and 10044 patients did not receive any additional antibiotics (control group). In the experimental group, 178 patients developed SSIs, compared to 356 patients in the control group. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that the incidence of SSIs in the experimental group was significant lower than that in the control group (95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.75, p=0.0004).Conclusion The topical application of antibiotics within the wound site is a crucial and efficient method to prevent SSIs after spinal surgery."

Herein we developed pragmatic strategies to track the emergence, spread and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Australia in an era of decreasing diagnostic PCR testing and focused cohort-based studies. This was aligned to longitudinal studies that span 4 years of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods Throughout 2023, we partnered with diagnostic pathology providers and pathogen genomics teams to identify relevant emerging or circulating variants in the New South Wales (NSW) community. We monitored emerging variants through viral culture, growth algorithms, neutralization responses and change entry requirements defined by ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptor use. To frame this in the context of the pandemic stage, we continued to longitudinally track neutralisation responses at the population level using using sequential batches of pooled Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIG) derived from in excess of 700,000 donations.Findings In antibodies derived from recent individual donations and thousands of donations pooled in IVIGs, we observed continued neutralization across prior and emerging variants with EG.5.1, HV.1, XCT and JN.1 ranked as the most evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants. Changes in the type I antibody site at Spike positions 452, 455 and 456 were associated with lowered neutralization responses in XBB lineages. In longitudinal tracking of population immunity spanning three years, we observed continued maturation of neutralization breadth to all SARS-CoV-2 variants over time. Whilst neutralization responses initially displayed high levels of imprinting towards Ancestral and early pre-Omicron lineages, this was slowly countered by increased cross reactive breadth to all variants. We predicted JN.1 to have a significant transmission advantage in late 2023 and this eventuated globally at the start of 2024. We could not attributed this advantage to neutralization resistance but rather propose that this growth advantage arises from the preferential utilization of TMPRSS2 cleavage-resistant ACE2.Interpretation The emergence of many SARS-CoV-2 lineages documented at the end of 2023 to be initially associated with lowered neutralization responses. This continued to be countered by the gradual maturation of cross reactive neutralization responses over time. The later appearance and dominance of the divergent JN.1 lineage cannot be attributed to a lack of neutralization responses alone, and we support its dominance to be the culmination of both lowered neutralization and changes in ACE2/TMPRSS2 entry preferences."

Thereafter, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) labeled ‘clear’ emerged on the market. We aimed to combine cardiovascular health effects with chemical analysis of ‘clear’ e-cigarettes.Methods We measured acute changes in blood pressure and heart rate following a 10-minute structured use of participants’ own e-cigarette, comparing ‘clear’ e-cigarette users with other flavored e-cigarette users and non-users. Chemical characterization and quantification of relevant flavorings and cooling agents (WS-3, WS-23) of 19 ‘clear’-labeled disposable e-cigarette liquids was carried out by GC/MS.Results After the ban, participants that used ‘clear’ labeled e-cigarettes increased from 0% to 21%. Increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate was significantly greater in ‘clear’ e-cigarettes users (n=22) compared to both non-’clear’ flavored e-cigarette users (n=114) and non-users (n=72). We saw similar results in heart rate when comparing Juul e-cigarette and ‘clear’ users; Juul was used as a reference as synthetic coolants WS-3 or WS-23 were not detected in these.All (19/19) ‘clear’ e-liquids were found to contain synthetic cooling agents WS-23 and/or WS-3, menthol (18/19), as well as other flavorings (12/19).Discussion The detected presence of menthol alongside other flavorings in tested ‘clear’ products is a direct violation of the MA flavored tobacco product regulation, warranting stricter monitoring for new products and constituents. ‘clear’ e-cigarette use led to greater hemodynamic effects compared to other flavored e-cigarettes and Juul, which raises questions about the effect of cooling agents on users."

This role is particularly vital in developing countries, where a 4.65% rise in maternal mortality rate was observed in 2022, with 800 maternal and 7,700 perinatal deaths reported. The study aims to analyse the predictors and geospatial trends of the number of visits and timing of antenatal care in Zambia from 1992 to 2018, utilizing a generalised linear mixed model approach. The analysis utilized the Zambia Demographic Health Survey (ZDHS) database. The relationship between dependent and independent variables was examined using the Rao-Scott Chi-square test. Predictors of inadequate utilisation of ANC were identified through the multilevel generalised linear model. Spatial effects were modeled using Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) version 3.34.1 to develop univariate choropleth maps. A total of 45, 140 (31, 482 women had less than 8 ANC visits and 2, 004 had 8 or more ANC visits) women with a prior childbirth were included in the study. The findings in the study revealed that among women aged 15 to 19 years in 1992, 1996 and 2013/14, the rates of inadequate antenatal care utilization (less than eight ANC visits) was 90.87%, 90.99%, and 99.63%, respectively. Lack of formal education was associated with inadequate ANC from 1992 to 2018, with percentages ranging from 91.12% to 99.64%. They were notable geospatial variations in the distribution of ANC underutilization across provinces with Luapula, Muchinga, Northwestern, Northern and Eastern recording higher proportions. Furthermore, the study showed that age (25 to 29 and 30 to 34) was associated with increased risk of inadequacy ANC utilization (AOR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.20 – 7.19 and AOR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.05 – 6.65 respectively). Higher education and wealth index correlated with reduced odds of inadequate ANC utilization. In conclusion, this study highlights worrisome trends in ANC utilization in Zambia, with a significant rise in inadequacy, especially in adhering to the WHO’s recommended eight ANC visits. Over the period from 1996 to 2018, there was a discernible decline in the prevalence of delayed initiation of ANC. The findings underscore a notable disparity between current ANC practices and established guidelines. Additionally, various factors predicting suboptimal ANC attendance have been identified. These insights call for targeted interventions to address the identified challenges and improve the overall quality and accessibility of ANC services in Zambia."

These two viruses are known to cause asymptomatic infection, however, studies to assess the seroprevalence in healthy individuals are limited. Our objective is to estimate the asymptomatic seroconversion status of both these infections Sri Lanka where dengue has been endemic and the last notable outbreak of chikungunya occurred in 2007.Methods The study was performed using venous blood samples of 454 healthy individuals (age range 11-78) in Kandy district, who had no known history of dengue or chikungunya infections in the past or present. Samples were tested for dengue NS1 antigen, dengue IgM, dengue IgG, Chikungunya IgM and Chikungunya IgG by using commercially available ELISA kits. Statistical data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results Of the 454 healthy individuals, 287 (63.2%) were positive for dengue IgG indicating a past infection and 18 (4%) were positive for dengue-specific IgM. Of the same total, 82 (18.1%) were positive chikungunya chikungunya-specific IgM and only 6 (1.3%) were positive for chikungunya-specific IgM. The number of individuals positive for both dengue IgG and Chikungunya IgG, indicating dual antibody prevalence or exposure to both diseases asymptomatically was 61(13.43%). For dengue specific IgG, the highest sero-conversion rate (80.4%) was observed in 51-60 year age group whilst the lowest (50%) in the age group 11-20. Out of the MOH areas, the highest prevalence (71.4%) of positives were observed in Bambaradeniya and the lowest prevalence (53.1%) in Yatinuwara suburbs in Kandy. The highest percentage of dengue IgM prevalence (6.3%) was observed in the age group 21-30 years and the lowest percentage (1.5%) was observed in the age group 11-20.Conclusions An asymptomatic seroconversion rate was observed in both dengue and Chikungunya infections. Dengue records a high rate due to its endemicity and periodic outbreaks. It is interesting to note the low-grade prevalence of Chikungunya infection contrary to the belief itsnon-existence in the island currently."

Study quality was assessed with a scoring system reflecting MR study guidelines. Data were pooled in meta-analyses using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were conducted by sex.Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes were the presence or severity of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and related psychotic disorders.Results Forty-one studies with 184 MR estimates were included in the systematic review; and 16 studies with 30 MR estimates were included in meta-analysis. Pooled estimates suggested that general adiposity was causally associated with depression (OR: 1.05, 95% CI, 1.00-1.10, p<0.001; I2=82.8%), though the effect size was modest and there was high heterogeneity. Subgroup difference by sex in the causal relationship was not observed (p=0.382). No evidence of causal associations was found between adiposity and other mental illnesses, though these analyses were characterized by high imprecision and heterogeneity.Conclusion and Relevance General adiposity appears to be causally associated with depression, suggesting psychological benefits of weight management. Evidence for causal associations between adiposity and other mental illnesses remains uncertain.Question Is adiposity causally associated with mental illnesses?Findings In this systematic review of 41 Mendelian randomization studies, with 184 MR estimates, and meta-analysis of 30 MR estimates, general adiposity was causally associated with depression. There was no evidence of sex differences. Evidence of causal associations between adiposity and other mental illnesses was unclear.Meaning The findings suggest that higher adiposity can cause depression, which highlights the psychological importance of weight management."

It is most often reported on a Likert scale of three to five values in surveys. To facilitate presentation and interpretation, it is common practice to simplify the variable by dichotomizing it; however, there has been little documented reflection on how this should be done. This paper explores all four possible dichotomizations of self-reported health, taken from three years of the Canadian Community Health Survey and reported by a Likert scale. We evaluated each dichotomization stratified by sociodemographic variables. We use regression analysis to explore the validity and reliability of all four possible dichotomizations by mapping them to the Health Utility Index. We found that lower cutpoints of dichotomization capture more pronounced differences in health status and are more consistent across sociodemographic variables. However, higher cutpoints of dichotomization should be considered for small data sets.About the Research Department The Saskatchewan Health Authority Research Department leads collaborative research to enhance Saskatchewan’s health and healthcare.

It is most often reported on a Likert scale of three to five values in surveys. To facilitate presentation and interpretation, it is common practice to simplify the variable by dichotomizing it; however, little documented reflection has been done on how this should be done.Methods We use regression analysis to explore the validity and reliability of all four possible dichotomizations of self-reported health in the Canadian Community Health Survey in 2013-2015 by mapping them to a validated health measure: the Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI). We posit that more valid cutpoints in self-rated health are associated with larger changes in HUI. We posit further that more reliable cutpoints are associated with similar changes across sociodemographic variables, including age, sex, education, marital status, geography and income. We also provide descriptive statistics to contextualize our analysis.Results The greatest proportion of respondents reported having “very good” health, although the proportion of the population reporting “excellent” or “very good” health decreased with age. Similarly, Canadians tend to score highly in HUI. Our regression results suggest that HUI tends to be higher for younger, richer, married, educated and urban populations. However, these associations are muted as the cutpoint used to dichotomize self-reported health is raised. The model with the lowest cutpoint, distinguishing between poor health and all other health statuses, was associated with the greatest and most consistent negative changes in HUI among different sociodemographic groups.Conclusions Dichotomizing self-rated health using lower cutpoints captures more pronounced differences in health status measured by HUI and tends to capture more consistent differences across sociodemographic variables. That is, lower cutpoints produce more valid and reliable results. However, lower cutpoints isolate less commonly reported health levels and may lead to less accurate results in smaller populations.Key PointsThis article addresses the knowledge gap concerning the most accurate way to dichotomize self-rated health data reported using a Likert scale.This paper explores the validity and reliability of all four possible dichotomizations of self-reported health reported by a Likert scale.Lower cutpoints of dichotomization capture more pronounced differences in health status and are more consistent across sociodemographic variables.Higher cutpoints of dichotomization should be considered for small data sets."

Older adults, aged 65 and above, are particularly vulnerable to higher and lower temperatures.Aim To explore older adult perception of health risks from high and low temperatures, what health-protective measures they have undertaken, and the factors associated with risks and responses.Methods Ipsos MORI conducted face-to-face surveys for the UK Health Security Agency with 461 participants in the cold weather survey and 452 in the hot weather survey. Participants reported temperature-related symptoms, risk perceptions for different groups, and behaviours during hot and cold weather. Data analysis involved using binomial logistic regression models to assess potential factors (demographics, vulnerability, behaviours, and responses) associated with older adults’ health risk perception in hot and cold weather.Results Less than half of older adults in both surveys agreed that hot or cold weather posed a risk to their health. Older adults with higher education, household income >£25,000 annually or home ownership were less likely to perceive their health at risk during cold weather. In both surveys, older adults who perceived people of the same age or people living alone as at an increased risk were more likely to perceive their own health as at risk. Furthermore, during cold weather, older adults were more likely to self-identify their health at risk when reporting other adults aged 65yrs+ to be at an increased risk, but not during hot weather. Various temperature-related protective behaviours were associated with older adults’ risk perception in hot and cold weather.Conclusion These findings highlight the need for effective risk communication strategies and targeted health messaging for older adults to support self-identification of risk. Future research should focus on barriers to risk perception and promoting health-protective behaviours in this population."

However, existing methods for analyzing wastewater sequencing data are not designed to detect novel variants that have not been characterized in humans. Here, we present an unsupervised learning approach that clusters co-varying and time-evolving mutation patterns leading to the identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants. To build our model, we sequenced 3,659 wastewater samples collected over a span of more than two years from urban and rural locations in Southern Nevada. We then developed a multivariate independent component analysis (ICA)-based pipeline to transform mutation frequencies into independent sources with co-varying and time-evolving patterns and compared variant predictions to >5,000 SARS-CoV-2 clinical genomes isolated from Nevadans. Using the source patterns as data-driven reference “barcodes”, we demonstrated the model’s accuracy by successfully detecting the Delta variant in late 2021, Omicron variants in 2022, and emerging recombinant XBB variants in 2023. Our approach revealed the spatial and temporal dynamics of variants in both urban and rural regions; achieved earlier detection of most variants compared to other computational tools; and uncovered unique co-varying mutation patterns not associated with any known variant. The multivariate nature of our pipeline boosts statistical power and can support accurate and early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants. This feature offers a unique opportunity for novel variant and pathogen detection, even in the absence of clinical testing."

While a range of different approaches has been applied to classify different parts of towns and cities, participatory stratification approaches (PSAs) have become popular despite their subjective basis because of their affordability, simplicity and practicality, all of which allow them to be frequently updated. While more objective statistical approaches, such as latent profile analysis (LPA), can also be used to stratify neighbourhoods using formal socio-economic and demographic data, these rely on the availability of rich datasets and advanced analytical capacities that are not always available in low and middle-income countries. This study assessed a PSA to stratify neighbourhoods across the Tanzania city of Dar es Salaam in terms of income, by comparing it with a complementary LPA using national census data from 2012 to stratify them in terms of deprivation. A consultative community-based workshop was used for the PSA, while 15 selected deprivation indicators from the census data were used to profile them using LPA. While the PSA allocated neighbourhoods to five income strata, six clear deprivation strata could be distinguished by LPA. A strong positive correlation was observed between the stratum identified by the LPA and that obtained through the PSA (ρ = 0.739, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, paired comparison of the two sets of correlation coefficients between each deprivation indicator and the stratum assigned by each stratification approach revealed no difference (V = 33, p-value = 0.1354), confirming that the two approaches yielded very similar patterns of stratification., Also, the two approaches yielded broadly comparable cartographic pictures of the city, depicting similar spatial distribution of wealth and poverty. Overall, this evidence indicates that subjective community knowledge and lived experience may be invaluable for understanding the built environment and for mapping out pockets of poverty and affluence at fine scales with minimum resources."

Establishing its safety profile is necessary prior to widespread clinical implementation.Methods We conducted a systematic review (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42024516676) of articles across seven databases from inception through February 10, 2024, with keywords related to myopia and RLRL therapy. Pooled safety outcomes and risk-to-benefit ratios were reported, and incidence of side effects was compared with other anti-myopia interventions. Quality appraisal was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.Results Among 689 screened articles, 20 studies (2.90%; eleven randomized controlled trials, four non-randomized controlled trials, one post-trial study, one single-arm study, one retrospective study and two case reports of identical patient.; median duration 9 months, longest 24 months) were analysed, encompassing 2,380 participants aged 3-18 years and 1,436 individuals undergoing RLRL therapy. Two case reports described an identical patient with reversible decline in visual acuity and optical coherence tomography (OCT) abnormalities, completely resolved 4 months after treatment cessation. No cases of permanent vision loss were reported. Temporary afterimage was the most common ocular symptom following treatment, resolving within 6 minutes in reported studies. The number needed to harm outweighed the number needed to treat by a ratio of 12.7-21.4 for a person with −3D to −8D myopia treated with RLRL therapy. Incidence of side effects from RLRL was 0.088 per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.50), comparable to spectacles designed for myopia reduction (0.22; 95% CI, 0.09-0.51; P=0.385), and significantly lower than for low-dose atropine (7.32; 95% CI, 6.65-8.05; P<0.001), orthokeratology (20.6; 95% CI, 16.7-25.0; P<0.001), other anti-myopia contact lens (19.3; 95% CI, 17.6-21.1; P<0.001).Conclusion No irreversible visual function loss or ocular structural damage was identified with RLRL. Fundus photography and OCT before and during therapy, alongside home monitoring of visual acuity and duration of afterimages, are necessary to identify side effects. Further adequately-powered studies of longer duration are needed to evaluate long-term safety of RLRL."

This communication presents interim findings from the new Omicron XBB adapted PHH-1V81 vaccine compared to a XBB adapted mRNA vaccine against XBB and JN.1 SARS-CoV-2 strains.Methods In a Phase IIb/III pivotal trial, adults previously vaccinated with a primary scheme and at least one booster dose of an EU-approved mRNA vaccine randomly received either PHH-1V81 or BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine booster as a single dose. The primary efficacy endpoint assessed neutralisation titers against the Omicron XBB.1.16 variant at day 14. Secondary endpoints evaluated neutralization titers and cellular immunity against different variants. Safety endpoints comprised solicited reactions up to day 7 post-vaccination and serious adverse events until the cut-off date of the interim analysis. Changes in humoral responses were reported as GMT and GMFR assessed by PBNA or VNA.Results At the cut-off date, immunogenicity assessments included 599 participants. Both boosters elicited neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and JN.1 with PHH-1V81 inducing a higher response for all variants. PHH-1V8 booster triggers a superior neutralizing antibodies response against XBBs variants compared to the mRNA vaccine. Subgroup analysis consistently revealed higher neutralizing antibody responses with PHH-1V81 across age groups, number of prior vaccination shots, and SARS-CoV-2 infection history. Safety analysis involved 607 participants at the day 14 visit, revealing favourable safety profiles without any serious vaccine-related adverse events at cut-off date of the interim analysis (12th December 2023).Conclusions PHH-1V81 demonstrates superiority on humoral immunogenicity compared to mRNA vaccine agains XBB variants and non-inferiority against JN.1 with favourable safety profile and lower reactogenicity, confirming its potential as vaccine candidate."

However, the impact of the choice of OCT versus IVUS on clinical outcomes and periprocedural complications is unclear.Objective To perform a meta-analysis of all vetted randomized controlled trials comparing OCT-guided versus IVUS-guided percutaneous coronary intervention.Methods We queried MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and clinicalTrials.gov databases from their commencement to February 2024 for all randomized controlled trials that compared OCT-guided versus IVUS-guided percutaneous coronary interventions. The primary endpoint was major adverse periprocedural events (MAPE), a composite of stent thrombosis (ST), distal embolization (DE), and distal edge dissection (DED). The secondary endpoints included stent thrombosis, distal embolization, distal edge dissection, Major-adverse-cardiac events (MACE)-[a composite of cardiac death, Target vessel myocardial infarction (TVMI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR)], all-cause mortality, cardiac death, TVMI, TVR, and nonfatal stroke. The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was analyzed using a random-effect model.Results Seven randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis, and 4446 patients were enrolled. OCT was associated with lower MAPE (OR: 0.65, CI:0.47-0.91, p= 0.01) compared to IVUS. ST, DE, and DED were similar between OCT and IVUS. There were no significant differences in MACE (OR: 0.86, CI:0.64-1.16, p= 0.32), all-cause mortality (OR: 0.83, CI:0.42-1.66, p= 0.60), Cardiac death (OR: 0.62, CI:0.20-1.89, p= 0.40), TVMI (OR: 0.69, CI:0.33-1.46, p= 0.33), TVR, (OR: 1.09, CI:0.70-1.71, p= 0.70), and non-fatal stroke (OR: 1.82, CI:0.67-4.95, p= 0.24) one year following the index procedure.Conclusion Optical coherence tomographic-guided PCI was associated with lower major adverse peri-procedural events (MAPE), including stent thrombosis, distal embolization, and distal edge dissection, compared to intravascular ultrasound-guided PCI. However, there was no difference in overall major adverse cardiac events, target vessel myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, and nonfatal stroke."

The incidence of bTB is highest in low-income settings with high cattle density and unpasteurised dairy consumption. Smallholder dairy farming has been steadily growing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with limited professional support for adequate bTB surveillance and risk mitigation. Several studies have explored the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of milk value chain’s stakeholders towards bTB in LMICs, but this evidence has not been collated and synthesised.Methodology We conducted a systematic review to determine what is known, believed, and done in relation to bTB among dairy producers and consumers in LMICs. We performed a systematic search of studies in OVID Medline, Scopus and CABI on 11 September 2023. KAP data were summarised using narrative synthesis and forest plots.Results We retrieved 2763 articles, retaining 51 for the review. Only studies from Africa (n=38) and Asia (n=13) met the eligibility criteria. Most populations reported awareness of human tuberculosis and knew it could be treated, but there was limited awareness of bTB and its zoonotic potential. Knowledge of bTB transmission routes and bTB mitigation varied and risky practices were also variable across populations. Inconsistencies in study design and survey tools suggest some results may have mid- to high risk of bias.Conclusions Awareness of bTB is surprisingly low among African and Asian populations with high bTB exposure risk, possibly due to the long-standing divide between animal and human health messages that has obscured the One Health implications of bTB. Addressing bTB in LMICs requires a structural One Health approach and standard KAP survey tools to adequately explore the socio-cultural, political, and economic processes and drivers favouring bTB spread and persistence."

We assessed multiple biomarkers and metabolites of exposure to mycotoxins at birth and their associations with birth outcomes and infant growth in 274 newborns in rural Burkina Faso.Methods and findings Whole blood microsamples were analyzed for mycotoxin concentrations in newborns in the Biospecimen sub-study nested in MISAME-III trial using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Unadjusted and adjusted associations between mycotoxin exposure, and birth outcomes and infant growth at 6 months were estimated using linear regression models for continuous outcomes and linear probability models with robust variance estimation for binary outcomes. Infant growth trajectories from birth to 6 months were compared by exposure status using mixed-effects models with random intercept for the individual infant and random slope for the infant’s age. Ochratoxin A (OTA) exposure was detected in 38.3% of newborns, with other mycotoxins being detected in the range of 0.36% and 4.01%. OTA exposure was significantly associated with adverse birth outcomes, such as lower birthweight (β (95% CI): −0.11 kg (−0.21, 0.00); p = 0.042) and ponderal index (β (95% CI): −0.62 gm/cm3 (−1.19, −0.05); p = 0.034), and a marginally significant lower height growth trajectories during the first 6 months (β (95% CI): −0.08 cm/mo (−0.15, 0.0); p = 0.057).Conclusions OTA exposure was prevalent among newborns and also associated with lower growth at birth and during the first 6 months. The results emphasize the importance of nutrition-sensitive strategies to mitigate dietary OTA, as well as adopting food safety measures in Burkina Faso during the fetal period of development."

Triplets and quadruplet studies have been examined in this same population. However, to date, none of these studies examined the impact of depth of response on long-term outcomes of participants treated with lenalidomide-based therapy, and whether the use of the 20/2/20 model or the addition of genomic alterations can further define the population that would benefit the most from early therapeutic intervention. Here, we present the results of the phase II study of the combination of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in patients with HR-SMM with long-term follow-up and baseline single-cell tumor and immune sequencing that help refine the population to be treated for early intervention studies.Methods This is a phase II trial of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IRD) in HR-SMM. Patients received 9 cycles of induction therapy with ixazomib 4mg on days 1, 8, and 15; lenalidomide 25mg on days 1-21; and dexamethasone 40mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. The induction phase was followed by maintenance with ixazomib 4mg on days 1, 8, and 15; and lenalidomide 15mg d1-21 for 15 cycles for 24 months of treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival after 2 years of therapy. Secondary endpoints included depth of response, biochemical progression, and correlative studies included single-cell RNA sequencing and/or whole-genome sequencing of the tumor and single-cell sequencing of immune cells at baseline.Results Fifty-five patients, with a median age of 64, were enrolled in the study. The overall response rate was 93%, with 31% of patients achieving a complete response and 45% achieving a very good partial response or better. The most common grade 3 or greater treatment-related hematologic toxicities were neutropenia (16 patients; 29%), leukopenia (10 patients; 18%), lymphocytopenia (8 patients; 15%), and thrombocytopenia (4 patients; 7%). Non-hematologic grade 3 or greater toxicities included hypophosphatemia (7 patients; 13%), rash (5 patients; 9%), and hypokalemia (4 patients; 7%). After a median follow-up of 50 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 48.6 months (95% CI: 39.9 – not reached; NR) and median overall survival has not been reached. Patients achieving VGPR or better had a significantly better progression-free survival (p<0.001) compared to those who did not achieve VGPR (median PFS 58.2 months vs. 31.3 months). Biochemical progression preceded or was concurrent with the development of SLiM-CRAB criteria in eight patients during follow-up, indicating that biochemical progression is a meaningful endpoint that correlates with the development of end-organ damage. High-risk 20/2/20 participants had the worst PFS compared to low- and intermediate-risk participants. The use of whole genome or single-cell sequencing of tumor cells identified high-risk aberrations that were not identified by FISH alone and aided in the identification of participants at risk of progression. scRNA-seq analysis revealed a positive correlation between MHC class I expression and response to proteasome inhibition and at the same time a decreased proportion of GZMB+ T cells within the clonally expanded CD8+ T cell population correlated with suboptimal response.Conclusions Ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone in HR-SMM demonstrates significant clinical activity with an overall favorable safety profile. Achievement of VGPR or greater led to significant improvement in time to progression, suggesting that achieving deep response is beneficial in HR-SMM. Biochemical progression correlates with end-organ damage. Patients with high-risk FISH and lack of deep response had poor outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: (NCT02916771)"

Because of a large number of variants identified by these tests, interpreting the final list of variants and identifying the disease-causing variant even after filtering out likely benign variants could be labor-intensive and time-consuming. It becomes even more burdensome when various variant types such as structural variants need to be considered simultaneously with small variants. One way to accelerate the interpretation process is to have all variants accurately prioritized so that the most likely diagnostic variant(s) are clearly distinguished from the rest.Methods To comprehensively predict the genomic test results, we developed a deep learning based variant prioritization system that leverages multiple instance learning and feeds multiple variant types for variant prioritization. We additionally adopted learning to rank (LTR) for optimal prioritization. We retrospectively developed and validated the model with 5-fold cross-validation in 23,115 patients with suspected rare diseases who underwent whole exome sequencing. Furthermore, we conducted the ablation test to confirm the effectiveness of LTR and the importance of permutational features for model interpretation. We also compared the prioritization performance to publicly available variant prioritization tools.Results The model showed an average AUROC of 0.92 for the genomic test results. Further, the model had a hit rate of 96.8% at 5 when prioritizing single nucleotide variants (SNVs)/small insertions and deletions (INDELs) and copy number variants (CNVs) together, and a hit rate of 95.0% at 5 when prioritizing CNVs alone. Our model outperformed publicly available variant prioritization tools for SNV/INDEL only. In addition, the ablation test showed that the model using LTR significantly outperformed the baseline model that does not use LTR in variant prioritization (p=0.007).Conclusion A deep learning model leveraging multiple instance learning precisely predicted genetic testing conclusion while prioritizing multiple types of variants. This model is expected to accelerate the variant interpretation process in finding the disease-causing variants more quickly for rare genetic diseases."

We identified three immunological clusters using XCell enrichment scores, highlighting an ‘immune-hot’ group correlating with poorer prognosis, suggesting potential benefits from immunotherapies. A radiomic signature predicting immunological profiles showed balanced accuracies of 81.5% and 84.4% across discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. Our clinicoradiomic model predicted progression-free survival with concordance indices of 0.71 and 0.77 in these cohorts, and the clinicoradiomic scores correlated with treatment response (p = 0.001). We also explored germline variants and transcriptomic pathways related to clinicoradiomic risk, identifying those involved in tumor growth and immune responses. This is the first radiogenomic analysis in pLGGs that enhances prognostication by prediction of immunological profiles, assessment of patients’ risk of progression, prediction of treatment response to standard-of-care therapies, and early stratification of patients to identify potential candidates for novel therapies targeting specific pathways."

Despite its potential, there is limited empirical evidence on the implementation of SMRs, and the challenges faced in the process. This study is part of a larger DynAIRx (Artificial Intelligence for dynamic prescribing optimisation and care integration in multimorbidity) project which aims to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) to SMRs and develop machine learning models and visualisation tools for patients with multimorbidity. Here, we explore how SMRs are currently undertaken and what barriers are experienced by those involved in them.Methods Qualitative focus groups and semi-structured interviews took place between 2022-2023. Nine focus groups were conducted with doctors, pharmacists and clinical pharmacologists (n=21), and three patient focus groups with patients at high-risk of rapidly worsening health from multimorbidity (n=13). Five semi-structured interviews were held with 2 pharmacists, 1 trainee doctor, 1 policy-maker and 1 psychiatrist. Transcripts were analysed using a thematic approach.Results Two key themes limiting the effectiveness of SMRs in clinical practice were identified: ‘Medication Reviews in Practice’ and ‘Medication-related Challenges’. Participants noted limitations to the efficient and effectiveness of SMRs in practice including the scarcity of digital tools for identifying and prioritising patients for SMRs; organisational and patient-related challenges in inviting patients for SMRs and ensuring they attend; the time-intensive nature of SMRs, the need for multiple appointments and shared decision-making; the impact of the healthcare context on SMR delivery; poor communication and data sharing issues between primary and secondary care; difficulties in managing mental health medications and specific challenges associated with anticholinergic medication.Conclusion SMRs are complex, time consuming and medication optimisation may require multiple follow-up appointments to enable a comprehensive review. There is a need for a prescribing support system to identify, prioritise and reduce the time needed to understand the patient journey when dealing with large volumes of disparate clinical information in electronic health records. However, monitoring the effects of medication optimisation changes with a feedback loop can be challenging to establish and maintain using current electronic health record systems."

We conducted an economic evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness of a lung cancer screening intervention, using the EarlyCDT®-Lung Test with subsequent x-ray and low-dose chest CT scans (LDCT) for patients with a positive test result, compared to both usual care and LDCT screening for the whole target population.Methods A lifetime analyses with a UK NHS and personal social services perspective was conducted using a decision model for a target population of 1,000 individuals, where model parameters came from the ECLS study and literature. The model simulated the probability distribution of stage at cancer detection (early vs. late) for each evaluated alternative. Quality adjusted life-years (QALY) assigned to patients were dependant on stage at detection during or after the screening period, costs were dependent on the diagnostic pathway followed by patients and on cancer stage at diagnosis. We estimated net monetary benefit (NMB) at policy relevant cost-effectiveness thresholds for base-case, deterministic sensitivity, and scenario analyses.Results The base case incremental NMB of the ECLS intervention compared to no screening was £33,179 (95% CI: -£81,396.4, £147,180) and £140,609 (95% CI: £36,255.1, £316,612) respectively for a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY. The same figures compared with LDCT screening were £162,095 (95% CI: £52,698.3, £271,735) and £52,185 (95% CI: -£113,152, £220,711). A deterministic sensitivity analysis indicated parameter values that resulted in a change to cost-effectiveness results, for example: prevalence of lung cancer (1%-4%); relative prevalence of early stage lung cancer (25%-75%); cost of the EarlyCDT®-Lung Test (£59-£201.5); test sensitivity for early stage lung cancer (25%-75%); and specificity of the test (50%-100%). A scenario analysis confirmed that the EarlyCDT®-Lung Test performs better than a zero-cost random test and showed that if the sensitivity of the test is assumed 25% (rather than base case 52%) the ECLS intervention would be not cost effective at a £30,000 per QALY threshold.Limitations Lack of trial resource data for the within study analysis resulted in partial reliance on expert opinion. Some participants may have modified their smoking behaviour due to participation in the trial.Conclusions The base case analysis results estimated that the ECLS intervention is the most cost-effective screening alternative, with highest probability of being cost-effective, when compared to no screening or LDCT screening. This result may change with modifications of the parameters, prevalence of lung cancer and EarlyCDT®-Lung Test cost, suggesting that the three alternatives considered in the main analysis are potentially cost-effective depending on the disease risk of the target population and the cost of testing."

Understanding these mechanisms is critical for developing treatments that address the underlying causes of diseases rather than merely the presenting symptoms. Moreover, the same dysfunctional biological mechanisms implicated in rare recessive diseases may also lead to milder and potentially preventable symptoms in carriers in the general population. Seizures are a common, extreme phenotype that can result from diverse and often elusive biological pathways in patients with ultrarare or undiagnosed disorders. In this pilot study, we present an approach to understand the biological pathways leading to seizures in patients from the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) by analyzing aggregated genotype and phenotype data from the UK Biobank (UKB). Specifically, we look for enriched phenotypes across UKB participants who harbor rare variants in the same gene known or suspected to be causally implicated in a UDN patient’s recessively manifesting disorder. Analyzing these milder but related associated phenotypes in UKB participants can provide insight into the disease-causing molecular mechanisms at play in the rare disease UDN patient. We present six vignettes of undiagnosed patients experiencing seizures as part of their recessive genetic condition, and we discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the spectrum of symptoms associated with UKB participants to the severe presentations exhibited by UDN patients. We find that in our set of rare disease patients, seizures may result from diverse, multi-step pathways that involve multiple body systems. Analyses of large-scale population cohorts such as the UKB can be a critical tool to further our understanding of rare diseases in general."

Despite this, achieving high vaccination coverage is still one of the pressing public health problems globally, particularly in low-and middle-income countries.Objective This study aims to identify factors associated with non- and incomplete vaccination status among children aged 12-23 months in Gindhir rural district, East Bale zone, Southeast Ethiopia.Methods A cross-sectional study supplemented with a qualitative study was conducted in the Gindhir district from April 25-June10/ 2021. A total of 563 mothers of children 12-23 months participated. Study participants were selected using computer-generated random numbers. The sample was proportionally allocated to the size of children 12-23 months in each kebele. An administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data using face-to-face interviews. Epi– data version 3.1 was used for data entry and SPSS version 25 software was used for data analysis. Bivariate and Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify the determinants of vaccination status at a P value of less than 0.05. Seven in-depth interviews and two focused group discussions were conducted and analyzed manually by coding.Results -Totally 563 mothers/caregivers with children aged 12-23 months participated with a 96.6% response rate. Of the 563 children included in the study, 307 (54.5% [95%CI: 50.1-58.8]) were fully vaccinated, 142(25.5% [95%CI:21.7-29.1]) were incompletely vaccinated and 114 (20.2% [95%CI: 16.7-23.8]) were not vaccinated at all. Home delivery [3.46 (95%CI: 1.27-9.40)], absence of nearby health facility[4.84(95% CI: 1.75-13.39)], lack of transportation incur cost [2.75(95%CI:1.06-7.14)], mothers/caregivers negative perceived benefits of child vaccination [2.69(95%CI: 1.35-5.37)], mothers/caregivers poor knowledge about VPDs [2.78(95%CI: 1.14-5.30)] and vaccination schedule [5.54(95%CI: 2.74-11.22)], and negative attitude towards vaccination[2.01(95%CI: 1.01-3.98)] were identified as independent predictors of non-vaccination. While home delivery [6.85 (95%CI: 1.69-27.79)], lack of provision of counselling by health workers [2.19(95%CI: 1.13-4.27)], mothers/caregivers’ poor knowledge about VPDs [2.71(95%CI: 1.60-4.58)] and vaccination schedule [3.30(95%CI: 1.90-5.74)], and attitude towards vaccination [2.53(95%CI: 1.47-3.38)] were significantly associated with incomplete vaccination status.Conclusion Designing and implementing public health interventions tailored to locally identified problems is vital to narrow the observed variation in childhood vaccination status."

Girls aged 12 to 13 were offered routine vaccination, and those aged 14 to 18 years in 2008 were offered ‘catch-up’ vaccination. Using Census 2011, Hospital Episode Statistics and mortality data for the population of England, we exploit the cut-off in eligibility and apply a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to assess the impact of HPV vaccination on cervical disease. Vaccination reduced the incidence of cervical dysplasia and cancer diagnoses by 31% and 75% respectively at ages 23 to 30 years in girls offered catch-up vaccination at ages 17 to 18 years compared to those who were just above the eligibility age for the catch-up vaccination, with a clear discontinuity. Reductions continued amongst girls offered routine vaccination. These estimates obtained with a quasi-experimental approach are similar to vaccine effectiveness estimates based on more traditional approaches. This novel approach provides further evidence of the HPV vaccination programme reducing adverse cervical outcomes in young women and could be used for future studies to evaluate major changes in HPV vaccination policy and for studies of longer-term outcomes including other cancers and deaths."

Our goal in the SACHA Study, drawing on evidence-based strategies to maximise response rates, was to achieve a representative sample of a wider range of health professionals, working in general practice, maternity services, pharmacies, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) clinics and specialist abortion services in Britain, to explore the knowledge, attitudes and experience of abortion care and views on future models of delivery.Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey of midwives, doctors, nurses and pharmacists in England, Scotland and Wales was undertaken between November, 2021 and July, 2022. We used a stratified cluster sampling approach to select a random sample of sites and all eligible staff within those services were asked to respond to the survey. Evidence-based strategies to maximise completion rates were adopted, including postal delivery of the one-page questionnaire with personal letter of invitation and a stamped address envelope for return, inclusion of an unconditional voucher and follow-up.Results Overall, 147 of the 314 (46.8%) health service sites randomly selected took part in the survey. Reasons for non-participation included local Research and Development (R&D) Department non-response, lack of resources or insufficient time to support or approve the study, lack of interest in or perceived relevance of the topic and insufficient capacity to take part, exacerbated by work demands during the COVID epidemic. Of the 1370 questionnaires sent to eligible identified participants within these services, 771 were completed and returned (56.3%). At the service level the highest proportion of returns was from SRH clinics (81.0%) and the lowest from general practice (32.4%). In relation to profession, returns were highest amongst midwives (69.6%) and lowest amongst pharmacists (36.5%).Conclusions Obtaining information about health professional knowledge, attitudes and practices is key to guide service development and policy and to identify gaps in training and service provision in abortion. Despite our attempts to gain a representative sample of health professionals, the challenges we experienced limited the representativeness of the sample, despite the use of an evidence-based strategy."

However, the molecular mechanisms through which diet affects health remain underexplored in humans. Here, we compare plasma metabolomic and proteomic profiles between dietary states for a unique group of individuals who alternate between omnivory and animal product restriction (APR) for religious reasons. We find that short-term APR is associated with extensive metabolic reprogramming not detected in a control group of continuously omnivorous individuals. We identify reductions in the levels of branched-chain amino acids and of most lipid classes, driving a metabolic profile associated with decreased risk for all-cause mortality. We show that 23% of APR-associated proteins are drug targets, and highlight eight proteins displaying the greatest magnitude of change upon APR (FGF21, FOLR2, SUMF2, HAVCR1, PLA2G1B, OXT, HPGDS, SPP1). We find that APR-associated reprogramming improves metabolic health and emphasise high-value targets for pharmacological intervention."

Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from trial participants to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of semorinemab and elucidate its mechanism of action.METHODS Qualified immunoassays were used to measure plasma and CSF biomarkers of tau, amyloidosis, glial activity, neuroinflammation, synaptic function, and neurodegeneration from participants enrolled in the Tauriel (NCT03289143) and Lauriet (NCT03828747) Phase II trials in prodromal-to-mild (P2M) and mild-to-moderate (M2M) AD.RESULTS Significant increases in plasma phosphorylated Tau 181 (pTau181) and CSF Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) followed administration of semorinemab in both studies. In the Lauriet study, plasma glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) levels rose progressively over the study period in the placebo group, but remained stable over time with the administration of semorinemab. In contrast, this was not observed in the Tauriel study. Semorinemab had no consistent impact on other biomarkers of AD pathophysiology that were evaluated.DISCUSSION Semorinemab engages and stabilizes plasma pTau181 in a manner consistent with previously reported data [1,2], and levels do not decrease after prolonged drug exposure. Increases to CSF YKL-40 suggest that semorinemab may stimulate microglia activation, while stabilization of plasma GFAP levels in Lauriet participants indicate that semorinemab may moderate reactive gliosis in M2M AD."

The present study was aimed at identifying the genetic variants associated with longevity in Indian population. Long living individuals (LLIs), aged 85+, were compared with younger controls, aged 18-49 years, using data from GenomegaDB, a genetic database of Indians living in India. An in-house developed custom chip, having variants associated with various cancers, cardiovascular, neurological, gastro-intestinal, metabolic and auto-immune disorders, was used to generate genotype data. Logistic regression analysis with top five genetic principal components as covariates resulted in 11 variants to be significantly associated with longevity at a p-value threshold of 5×10−4. Alleles associated with slower heart rate (rs365990, MYH6), lower risk of osteoporosis and short body height (rs2982570, ESR1), decreased risk of schizophrenia (rs1339227, RIMS1-KCNQ5) and decreased risk of anxiety and neuroticism (rs391957, HSPA5) were found to have higher frequency in LLIs. Alleles associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (rs3903239, GORAB-PRRX1) and biliary disorders (rs2002042, ABCC2) were found have lower frequency. The G allele of rs2802292 from FOXO3A gene, associated with longevity in Japanese, German and French centenarians, was also found to be significant in this population (P=0.027). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the genes involved in oxidative stress, apoptosis, DNA damage repair, glucose metabolism and energy metabolism were significantly involved in increasing the longevity. Results of our study demonstrate the genetic basis of healthy aging and longevity in the population."

The present study aimed to measure the benefit of sphincterotomy for suspected SOD.Design Prospective cohort conducted at 14 U.S. centers with 12 months follow-up. Patients undergoing first-time ERCP with sphincterotomy for suspected SOD were eligible: pancreatobiliary-type pain with or without iAP. The primary outcome was defined as the composite of improvement by Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), no new or increased opioids, and no repeat intervention. Missing data were addressed by hierarchal, multiple imputation scheme.Results Of 316 screened, 213 were enrolled with 190 (89.2%) of these having a dilated bile duct, abnormal labs, iAP, or some combination. By imputation, an average of 122/213 (57.4% [95%CI 50.4-64.4]) improved; response rate was similar for those with complete follow-up (99/161, 61.5%, [54.0-69.0]); of these, 118 (73.3%) improved by PGIC alone. Duct size, elevated labs, and patient characteristics were not associated with response. AP occurred in 37/213 (17.4%) at a median of 6 months post-ERCP and was more likely in those with a history of AP (30.9 vs. 2.9%, p<0.0001).Conclusion Nearly 60% of patients undergoing ERCP for suspected SOD improve, although the contribution of a placebo response is unknown. Contrary to prevailing belief, duct size and labs are poor response predictors. AP recurrence was common and like observations from prior non-intervention cohorts, suggesting no benefit of sphincterotomy in mitigating future AP episodes.Key MessagesWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICIt is not clear if the sphincter of Oddi can cause abdominal pain (Functional Biliary Sphincter of Oddi Disorder) and idiopathic acute pancreatitis (Functional Pancreatic Sphincter of Oddi Disorder), and whether ERCP with sphincterotomy can ameliorate abdominal pain or pancreatitis.WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSWHAT THIS STUDY ADDSUsing multiple patient-reported outcome measures, most patients with suspected sphincter of Oddi disorder improve after ERCP with sphincterotomy.Duct size, elevated pancreatobiliary labs, and baseline patient characteristics are not independently associated with response.There is a high rate of recurrent acute pancreatitis within 12 months of sphincterotomy in those with a history of idiopathic acute pancreatitis.HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE, OR POLICYHOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE, OR POLICYSince a discrete population with a high (> 80-90%) response rate to sphincterotomy for suspected pancreatobiliary pain could not be identified, there is a need for additional observational and interventional studies that include phenotyping of patients using novel imaging or biochemical biomarkers.There remains a pressing need for quantitative nociceptive biomarkers to distinguish pancreatobiliary pain from other causes of abdominal pain or central sensitization.Discovery of blood-, bile-, or imaging-based biomarkers for occult microlithiasis and pancreatitis may be helpful in predicting who is likely to benefit from sphincterotomy."

Children aged 9 months to 5 years were systematically sampled at 30 SIA sites in Choma and Ndola Districts. A questionnaire was administered to the caregiver to collect the child’s demographic information and history of routine measles-rubella (MR) vaccination, and dried blood spot specimens were collected from the child. Specimens were tested for Immunoglobulin-G antibodies to measles and rubella viruses by enzyme immunoassay.Among children enrolled with MR vaccination data (N=2,364), 2,214 (94%) reported at least one routine MR dose before the SIA. We estimate 5.0% (118/2364) of children would not have otherwise received routine MR dose 1 without the SIA and 23.4% (553/2364) would not have otherwise received routine MR dose 2. Thus, 1 in 3.5 doses were given to an MR un- or under-vaccinated child who may not have received that dose in the absence of an SIA. Eighty-six percent of children were measles seropositive and 90% were rubella seropositive before vaccination during the SIA. Thirty-six percent of children with no prior routine MR dose were measles seropositive while nine percent of children with two prior routine MR doses were measles seronegative.Although children vaccinated during this SIA were highly likely to already have received routine vaccinations, the SIA reached a considerable number of susceptible children. Monitoring SIA effectiveness and efficiency is important to understand the benefits of vaccine delivery strategies in reaching un- and under-vaccinated children and may guide alternative strategies."

We also conducted age- and cause-specific decomposition of life expectancy change. Trends in life span equality from 2000–22 were evaluated at the national level.Results Prefectural analysis of 2021–22 life expectancy change and annual perpopulation COVID-19 cases, person-days in intensive care, and reported COVID-19 deaths showed no significant correlations, unlike our analysis from 2020–21. However, decomposition analysis revealed substantial life expectancy shortening attributable to the population over 35 years old. It also showed large increases in causes of death such as cardiovascular or respiratory disorders as well as COVID-19. Whole-population life span equality declined in 2020 but increased in 2021 and 2022 despite the shorter life expectancy.Conclusions Discrepancy between life expectancy change and COVID-19 statistics in 2022 suggests the growing ascertainment bias of COVID-19. The increased contribution of cardiovascular disorders to life expectancy shortening is an alarming sign for the future. Life span equality changes in 2021 and 2022 can probably be attributed to increased mortality among older people.HighlightsLife expectancy change was not correlated with COVID-19 epidemic activity in 2022Older people made the biggest contribution to shorter life expectancyCardiovascular disorders contributed substantially to shortening of life expectancyLife span equality increased in 2021 and 2022 despite shorter life expectancy"

We investigated the effects of glucose loading on striatal DAT in healthy young adults who underwent 18F-FP-CIT positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and sweet taste questionnaire (STQ). Thirty-five healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Each subject visited the institution three times, for three brain PET scans (two 18F-FP-CIT PET scans after the infusion of glucose or placebo and one 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan). All subjects underwent STQ, 12-item self-reporting to evaluate subjects’ reactions to eating sweets, craving for sweets and degree of control over eating sweet foods (STQ 1: sensitivity to mood altering effect of sweets, and STQ 2: impaired control over eating sweet foods). We created Bayesian models separately with STQ 1, and STQ 2 as predictors, with DAT availability and brain glucose uptake as a dependent variable. From caudate, glucose-loaded DAT availability was significantly higher than placebo-loaded DAT availability, and from putamen, glucose-loaded DAT availability showed the higher trend than placebo-loaded DAT availability. STQ was positively associated with glucose-loaded DAT availability. The effect of STQ markedly overlapped with zero on placebo-loaded DAT availability, and brain glucose uptake. In conclusion, the change of striatal DAT availability after glucose loading is associated with the vulnerability to sweet foods. This may indicate that individuals with higher DAT availability after glucose loading experience a rapid clearance of synaptic dopamine after consuming sweet foods, potentially leading to a desire for additional sweet foods."

Using free-text from antibiotic prescribing data as an example, we investigate the performance of modern natural language processing methods (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) as tools for extracting features from medical records.Methods We used 938,150 hospital antibiotic prescriptions from Oxfordshire, UK. The 4000 most frequently used free-text indications justifying antibiotic use were labelled by clinical researchers into 11 categories describing the infection source/clinical syndrome being treated and used for model training. Traditional classification methods, fuzzy regex matching and n-grams with XGBoost, were compared against modern transformer models: we fine-tuned generic and domain-specific BERT models, fine-tuned GPT3.5, and investigated few-shot learning with GPT4. Models were evaluated on internal and external test datasets (2000 prescriptions each). Infection sources determined from ICD10 codes were also used for comparisons.Results In internal and external test datasets, the fine-tuned domain-specific Bio+Clinical BERT model averaged an F1 score of 0.97 and 0.98 respectively across the classes and outperformed the traditional regex (F1=0.71 and 0.74) and n-grams/XGBoost (F1=0.86 and 0.84). OpenAI’s GPT4 model achieved F1 scores of 0.71 and 0.86 without using labelled training data and a fine-tuned GPT3.5 model F1 scores of 0.95 and 0.97. Comparing infection sources extracted from ICD10 codes to those parsed from free-text indications, free-text indications revealed 31% more specific infection sources.Conclusion Modern transformer-based models can efficiently and accurately categorise semi-structured free-text in medical records, such as prescription free-text. Finetuned local transformer models outperform LLMs currently for structured tasks. Few shot LLMs match the performance of traditional NLP without the need for labelling. Transformer-based models have the potential to be used widely throughout medicine to analyse medical records more accurately, facilitating beter research and patient care."

Here we examine the feasibility of using cord blood DNAm scores leveraging large external studies as discovery samples to capture the epigenetic signature of maternal smoking and its influence on newborns in White European and South Asian populations. We first examined association between individual CpGs and cigarette smoking during pregnancy, smoking exposure in two White European birth cohorts (n = 744). Several previously reported genes for maternal smoking were supported, with the strongest and most consistent signal from the GFI1 gene (6 CpGs with p < 5×10-5). Leveraging established CpGs for maternal smoking, we constructed a cord blood epigenetic score of maternal smoking that was internally validated in one of the European-origin cohorts (n = 347). This score was then tested for association with smoking status, secondary smoking exposure during pregnancy, and health outcomes in offspring measured after birth in an independent white European (n = 397) and a South Asian birth cohort (n = 504). The epigenetic maternal smoking score was strongly associated with smoking status during pregnancy (OR=1.09 [1.07,1.10], p=1.96×10-32) and more hours of self-reported smoking exposure per week (1.97 [1.22, 2.71], p=2.80×10-7) in White Europeans, but not with self-reported exposure (p > 0.05) in South Asians. The same score was consistently associated with smaller birth size (-0.22 cm [-0.35, -0.083], p=0.0016) and lower birth weight (-0.05kg [-0.075, -0.025], p =3.42×10-4) in the combined South Asian and White European cohorts. This cord blood epigenetic score can help identify babies exposed to maternal smoking and assess its long-term impact on growth. Notably, these results indicate a consistent association between the DNAm signature of maternal smoking and a small body size and low birthweight in newborns, in both white European mothers who exhibited some amount of smoking and in South Asian mothers who themselves were not active smokers."

In drug addiction, a key mechanism is maladaptive motivational salience attribution whereby drug cues outcompete other reinforcers within the same environment or context. We predicted that while watching a drug-themed movie, where cues for drugs and other stimuli share a continuous narrative context, fMRI responses in individuals with heroin use disorder (iHUD) will preferentially synchronize during drug scenes. Results revealed such drug-biased synchronization in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventromedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and insula. After 15 weeks of inpatient treatment, there was a significant reduction in this drug-biased shared response in the OFC, which correlated with a concomitant reduction in dynamically-measured craving, suggesting synchronized OFC responses to a drug-themed movie as a neural marker of craving and recovery in iHUD."

Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale (cut-off value ≥20). Participants reported exposure to TLEs during adulthood. Logistic regression adjusted for multiple covariates was used as the individual-based analyses. The effect of shared familial factors was tested using conditional logistic regression in 399 twin pairs discordant for depression.Results Depression was more common in women (15%) than in men (11%). Men reported more traffic accidents (men: 11.8%, women: 7.4%), other serious accidents (11.8%, 5.8%), and violent crime (3.1%, 2.0%) whereas women reported more sexual assault (0.7%, 10.6%). Violent crime (Odds Ratio 3.86; 95% Confidence Intervals 2.59, 5.73), sexual assault (3.49; 2.67, 4.55), physical assault (3.10; 2.45, 3.93), and other serious accidents (1.36; 1.01, 1.85) were associated with depression. These associations, except other serious accidents, remained statistically significant after adjusting for multiple covariates including TLEs load and shared familial factors. The associations did not differ by sex.Conclusions Women and men differ in exposure to TLEs but, if exposed, they are equally vulnerable for depression. Because traumatic life events are robustly associated with depression, they should be considered in prevention and treatment."

Given the large population sizes and limited vaccine rollout in Asia, the potential risk of global mpox reemergence arising from Asia is of concern. Using a mathematical model incorporating heterogeneous sexual networks among MSM, calibrated to incidence data in Japan, we projected the patterns of international mpox spread across 42 Asian countries. Our simulations highlight countries at a high risk of mpox introductions, many of which were low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in South-eastern Asia. Our analysis also suggests a shifting focus of importation risk from Eastern Asia to South-eastern Asia, and subsequently to Central, Southern and Western Asia, which roughly coincided with the observed spread patterns in 2023. Global cooperation and support are warranted, especially for LMICs with an elevated risk of mpox introduction, to minimise the risk of continued circulation in Asia and beyond."

Osteosarcoma patients often develop metastatic disease, resulting in limited therapeutic options and poor survival rates. To gain knowledge on the mechanisms underlying osteosarcoma heterogeneity and metastatic process, it is important to obtain a detailed profile of the genomic alterations that accompany osteosarcoma progression. We performed WGS on multiple tissue samples from six patients with osteosarcoma, including the treatment naïve biopsy of the primary tumor, resection of the primary tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, local recurrence and distant metastases. SNVs and structural variants were found to accumulate over time, contributing to an increased complexity of the genome of osteosarcoma during progression. Phylogenetic trees based on SNVs and structural variants reveal distinct evolutionary patterns between patients, including linear, neutral and branched patterns. The majority of osteosarcomas showed variable copy number profiles or gained whole genome doubling in later occurrences. Additionally, chromothripsis is not confined to a single early event, as multiple other chromothripsis events may appear in later occurrences. Together, we provide a detailed analysis of the complex genome of osteosarcomas and show that five out of six osteosarcoma genomes are highly dynamic and variable during progression."

We aimed to assess these influences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, characterized by varying levels of human mobility.Methods Google’s human mobility indices (including residential, parks and workplaces) and weather conditions (total rainfall and mean temperature) together with Aedes albopictus abundance and extensiveness monitored using Gravidtrap were obtained between April 2020 and August 2022. Distributed lag non-linear models with mixed-effects models were used to explore their influence in three areas in Hong Kong.Findings The relative risk (RR) of mosquito abundance was associated with low rainfall (<50 mm) after 4.5 months, with a maximum of 1.73, compared with 300 mm. Heavy rainfall (>500 mm) within 3 months was also associated with a peak of RR at 1.41. Warm conditions (21-30°C; compared with 20°C) were associated with a higher RR of 1.47 after half a month. Residential mobility was negatively associated with mosquito abundance. The model projected that if residential mobility in the year 2022 was reduced to the level before the COVID-19 pandemic, the mosquito abundance would increase by an average of 80.49% compared to the actual observation.Significance Both the human mobility and the lag effect of meteorological factors can be critical for the prediction of vector dynamics, and stay-at-home policy may be useful for its control in certain regions.AUTHOR SUMMARY Previous studies have demonstrated that both meteorological factors and human mobility were linked to the risk of Dengue transmission, with rainfall potentially exerting delayed effects. Moreover, dry conditions have been found to increase Dengue risk in recent years. However, the impact of these factors on vector (mosquito) activity remains unclear. This study assessed the effect of human mobility and rainfall on the Dengue mosquito. The Gravitrap indices were used to characterize local mosquito (Aedes Albopictus) abundance and extensiveness conditions. We used established Gravitrap indices to characterize mosquito abundance and extensiveness in Hong Kong. We found that i) the decrease in residential mobility might increase mosquito abundance and extensiveness; and ii) low rainfall (<50 mm) was associated with a higher risk of mosquito abundance after 4.5 months. Additionally, heavy rainfall was associated with increased mosquito activity risk.The future mosquito activity risk is expected to increase because of the relaxation of social distancing measures after the COVID-19 pandemic along with climate change. The results suggest that non-linear delayed effects of meteorological factors together with human mobility change can be used for the Dengue mosquito forecast. Social distancing may be a way to reduce the risk of Aedes albopictus."

Negative binomial regression models assessed disparities between women and men, across SEP quintiles and age groups, in testing, positivity, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and mortality (Incidence Rate Ratios [IRR], with 95% Confidence Intervals [CI]).Results Women had higher testing and positivity rates than men, while men experienced more hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths. The higher positivity in women under 50 was mitigated when accounting for their higher testing rates. Within SEP quintiles, gender/sex differences in testing and positivity were not significant. In the lowest quintile, women’s mortality risk was 68% lower (Q1: IRR 0.32, CI 0.20-0.52), with decreasing disparities with increasing SEP quintiles (Q5: IRR 0.66, CI 0.41-1.06).Conclusion Our findings underscore the complex epidemiological patterns of COVID-19, shaped by the interactions of gender/sex, SEP, and age, highlighting the need for intersectional perspectives in both epidemiological research and public health strategy development."

Reporting Standards for Expert Panel, Best-Estimate Diagnosis, and Longitudinal Expert All Data (LEAD) Studies","AbstractAccurate assessments of symptoms and diagnoses are essential for health research and clinical practice but face many challenges. The absence of a single error-free measure is currently addressed by assessment methods involving experts reviewing several sources of information to achieve a more accurate or best-estimate assessment. Three bodies of work spanning medicine, psychiatry, and psychology propose similar assessment methods: The Expert Panel, the Best-Estimate Diagnosis, and the Longitudinal Expert All Data (LEAD). However, the quality of such best-estimate assessments is typically very difficult to evaluate due to poor reporting of the assessment methods and when it is reported, the reporting quality varies substantially. Here we tackle this gap by developing reporting guidelines for such studies, using a four-stage approach: 1) drafting reporting standards accompanied by rationales and empirical evidence, which were further developed with a patient organization for depression, 2) incorporating expert feedback through a two-round Delphi procedure, 3) refining the guideline based on an expert consensus meeting, and 4) testing the guideline by i) having two researchers test it and ii) using it to examine the extent previously published articles report the standards. The last step also demonstrates the need for the guideline: 18 to 58% (Mean = 33%) of the standards were not reported across fifteen randomly selected studies. The LEADING guideline comprises 20 reporting standards related to four groups: The Longitudinal design; the Appropriate data; the Evaluation – experts, materials, and procedures; and the Validity group. We hope that the LEADING guideline will be useful in assisting researchers in planning, reporting, and evaluating research aiming to achieve best-estimate assessments.Open data (Delphi surveys 1 and 2), code (analyses), and material (surveys): https://osf.io/fkv4b/"

These disorders include inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), and eosinophilic disorders (eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic duodenitis). Gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders can often present with overlapping symptoms necessitating the use of invasive procedures to give an accurate diagnosis. This study used peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and eosinophilic duodenitis to better understand the alterations to the transcriptome of individuals with these diseases and identify potential markers of active inflammation within the peripheral blood of patients that may be useful in diagnosis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from the blood samples of pediatric patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal disorders, including Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic duodenitis, and controls with histologically healthy gastrointestinal tracts. We identified 730 (FDR < 0.05) differentially expressed genes between individuals with gastrointestinal disorders and controls across eight immune cell types. There were common patterns among GI disorders, such as the widespread upregulation of MTRNR2L8 across cell types, and many differentially expressed genes showed distinct patterns of dysregulation among the different gastrointestinal diseases compared to controls, including upregulation of XIST across cell types among individuals with ulcerative colitis and upregulation of Th2-associated genes in eosinophilic disorders. These findings indicate both overlapping and distinct alterations to the transcriptome of individuals with gastrointestinal disorders compared to controls, which provide insight as to which genes may be useful as markers for disease in the peripheral blood of patients."

Cognitive training has emerged as a safe and effective intervention for vascular cognitive impairment no dementia, though its underlying mechanisms remain obscure. This study investigates how subcortical vascular cognitive impairment no dementia and computerized cognitive training affect a brain fundamental organization feature named functional lateralization.Methods In a randomized, active-controlled trial, patients with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment no dementia were divided into training and control groups, and underwent neuropsychological assessments and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, end of 7-week intervention, and 6-month follow-up. Additionally, a healthy older group provided baseline data. Two types of functional lateralization indices (LIs) were defined based on resting-state functional connectivity: LI of intrahemispheric functional connectivity (LI_intra) which represents the left-right difference of functional connectivity strength within the same hemisphere, and LI of interhemispheric heterotopic functional connectivity (LI_he) which represents the left-right difference of functional connectivity strength across bilateral hemispheres.Results Initially, patients (28 in training group and 28 in control group) showed a fronto-parietal network lateralization pattern akin to healthy older adults (N = 26). However, enhanced right-lateralized LI_he was associated with better memory solely in healthy adults. After the intervention, only the training group exhibited a reduction in LI_he in the fronto-parietal network, indicating a lateralization shift towards bilateral network connectivity. This shift, especially towards leftward lateralization, was linked with improved executive and memory functions in the training group. Notably, these changes disappeared at the 6-month follow-up.Discussion These findings suggest that subcortical vascular cognitive impairment no dementia modifies the relationship between fronto-parietal network lateralization and cognitive function, rather than altering the lateralization pattern itself. Through hemispherical reorganizing and balancing of the fronto-parietal network, short-term computerized cognitive training facilitates executive and memory functions by leveraging functional compensation by reorganization. This study illuminates the neural plasticity induced by cognitive training in vascular cognitive impairment no dementia, highlighting its potential to transform cognitive outcomes by tapping into the brain’s capacity for reorganization and adaptation.Trial registration The trial was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02640716) and conducted under both CONSORT statement and CONSORT statement for nonpharmacological interventions."

However, generating accurate estimates of these quantities, that are informed by both epidemic time series and pathogen genome sequence data, is a challenging problem. While birth-death processes and coalescent-based models are popular methods for modelling the transmission of infectious diseases, they both struggle (for different reasons) with estimating the prevalence of infection.Here we extended our approximate likelihood, which combines phylogenetic information from sampled pathogen genomes and epidemiological information from a time series of case counts, to estimate historical prevalence (in addition to the effective reproduction number). We implement this new method in a BEAST2 package called Timtam. In a simulation study our approximation is well-calibrated and can recover the parameters of simulated data.To demonstrate how Timtam can be applied to real data sets we carried out empirical analyses of data from two infectious disease outbreaks: the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in early 2020 and poliomyelitis in Tajikistan in 2010. In both cases we recover estimates consistent with previous analyses."

Established microbial sampling methods, such as swabs and tissue biopsies, provide limited information on the spatial distribution of bacteria. We here describe a new method that produces a visual map of the distribution of cultivable bacteria, denoted “Bactogram”, across the whole wound and surrounding skin, suitable for image-based quantification. As part of an exploratory endpoint in a clinical trial (NCT05378997) we applied the Bactogram method to 48 suction blister wounds in 24 healthy volunteers. Bacteria developed in all wounds, predominantly on the skin under the dressing and near wound edges. Two quantification methods, based on visual scoring and image analysis, demonstrated high inter-, and intra-rater agreement and were used to characterize bacterial re-colonization during epidermal wound healing. We also demonstrated proof of concept that the method can be used with chromogenic agar to enable spatial identification of pathogenic bacterial species, such as Staphylococcus aureus. In conclusion, this study introduces a simple method for sampling bacteria over large areas and generating a bacterial map that can identify spatial variations in bacterial composition and abundance in skin and wound conditions."

Further advancements depend on novel therapies and more precise risk stratification criteria. In the context of computational flow cytometry and machine learning, this paper aims to explore the potential prognostic value of flow cytometry data at diagnosis, a relatively unexplored direction for relapse prediction in this disease. To this end, we collected a dataset of 252 patients from three hospitals and implemented a comprehensive pipeline for multicenter data integration, feature extraction, and patient classification, comparing the results with existing algorithms from the literature. The analysis revealed no significant differences in immunophenotypic patterns between relapse and non-relapse patients and suggests the need for alternative approaches to handle flow cytometry data in relapse prediction."

Instead, clinicians rely on brief procedure notes and still frames to manage bladder pathology. Preserving discarded data via 3D reconstructions, which are convenient to review, has the potential to improve patient care. However, many clinical videos are collected by fiberscopes, which are lower cost but induce a pattern on frames that inhibits 3D reconstruction. The aim of this study is to remove the honeycomb-like pattern present in fiberscope-based cystoscopy videos to improve the quality of 3D bladder reconstructions.Approach This study introduces a novel algorithm that applies a notch filtering mask in the Fourier domain to remove the honeycomb-like pattern from clinical cystoscopy videos collected by fiberscope as a preprocessing step to 3D reconstruction. We produce 3D reconstructions with the video before and after removing the pattern, which we compare with a novel metric termed the area of reconstruction coverage (ARC), defined as the surface area (in pixels) of the reconstructed bladder. All statistical analyses use paired t-tests.Results Preprocessing using our method for pattern removal enabled reconstruction for all (n = 5) cystoscopy videos included in the study and produced a statistically significant increase in bladder coverage (p = 0.018).Conclusions This algorithm for pattern removal increases bladder coverage in 3D reconstructions and automates mask generation and application, which could aid implementation in time-starved clinical environments. The creation and use of 3D reconstructions can improve documentation of cystoscopic findings for future surgical navigation, thus improving patient treatment and outcomes."

Schools are considered an appropriate and logical setting for youth suicide prevention activities, with universal, selective, and indicated approaches all demonstrating efficacy. Given that international best practice recommends suicide prevention programmes combine these approaches, and that to date this has not been done in school settings in the UK, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of delivering a suicide prevention programme incorporating universal, selective, and indicated components in UK schools.Methods This study is a feasibility cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) of an adapted version of the Multimodal Approach to Preventing Suicide in Schools (MAPSS) programme. The programme, initially developed in Australia, involves delivering universal psychoeducation to all pupils, screening them for suicide risk, and delivering Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (Reframe IT-UK) to those students identified as being at high-risk for suicide. The programme will be trialled in six secondary schools in Northwest England and will target Year 10 students (14- and 15-year-olds). The primary aims are to assess: 1) the acceptability and safety of delivering MAPSS in a school setting in the UK; 2) the social validity of the MAPSS programme; and 3) the feasibility of delivering a large-scale, appropriately powered, cluster-RCT and economic evaluation of this intervention in the future. Secondary aims are to assess changes over time in mental health and wellbeing outcomes.Discussion This study is the first to evaluate a suicide prevention programme comprising universal, selective, and indicated components in UK schools. If the programme is found to be feasible, it could be more widely tested in schools and may ultimately lead to reduced rates of suicide and suicidal behaviour in young people."

Mean speeds of centre of pressure along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes, weight-bearing asymmetry, and symmetry index were calculated. Concurrent validity of these measures were established against the Berg Balance Scale; their abilities in differentiating fallers from non-fallers, and individuals with low-moderate versus high risk of falling were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).Results Among the measures studied, mean speed of centre of pressure along the anterior-posterior axis demonstrated the strongest correlation with the Berg Balance Scale (ρ=-0.430, p-value=0.01). Weight-bearing asymmetry showed the highest ability in differentiating fallers from non-fallers (AUC= 0.69), as well as individuals with low-moderate versus high risk of falling (AUC= 0.66).Significance Our findings suggest that speed of centre of pressure along the anterior-posterior axis, and weight-bearing asymmetry are valid for use in the sub-acute stage of stroke recovery. These validated measures can better inform rehabilitation practice about the ability of upright standing balance following a stroke."

Two United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vaccines, both requiring reconstitution (VRR) prior to administration, are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for adults aged 60+ years. An alternative vaccine employing a ready-to-use prefilled syringe (PFS) is currently under evaluation by the FDA. The current study compared a PFS versus two VRRs (VRR1 and VRR2) to evaluate preparation time, errors, satisfaction, and preference in a randomized, single-blinded time and motion (T&M) study.Methods Participants were recruited and randomized to a preparation sequence of the three vaccines. Participants read instructions, then consecutively prepared the three vaccines with a 3- to 5-minute washout period in between. Preparations were video recorded and reviewed by a trained pharmacist for preparation time and errors using predefined, vaccine-specific checklists. Participant demographics, satisfaction with vaccine preparation, and vaccine preference were recorded. Within-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare preparation time. Mixed-effects Poisson and ordered logistic regression models were used to compare number of preparation errors and satisfaction scores, respectively.Results 63 pharmacists (60%), nurses (35%), and pharmacy technicians (5%) participated at four sites in the US. The least squares (LS) mean preparation time per dose for PFS was 141.8 seconds (95% CI:156.8, 126.7; p<0.0001) faster than for VRR1, 103.6 seconds (118.7, 88.5; p<0.0001) faster than for VRR2, and 122.7 seconds (95% CI: 134.2, 111.2; p<0.0001) faster than the pooled VRRs. Overall satisfaction (combined ‘Very’ and ‘Extremely’) was 87.3% for PFS, 28.6% for VRR1, and 47.6% for VRR2. Most participants (81.0%) preferred the PFS vaccine.Conclusion PFS vaccines can greatly simplify the vaccine preparation process, allowing administrators to prepare almost four times more doses per hour than with vial and syringe systems.Why carry out this study?Two US FDA approved vaccines against RSV require reconstitution. An alternative vaccine employing a ready-to-use prefilled syringe (PFS) is currently under evaluation by the FDA. ● We conducted the current study to compare the impact of RSV vaccine format on preparation time, errors, satisfaction and preference between a ready-to-use single-dose prefilled syringe (PFS) RSV vaccine versus two RSV vaccines requiring reconstitution (VRRs).What was learned from the study?Preparation time with PFS was reduced by a factor of 4 compared to VRRs.Most healthcare professionals were extremely satisfied and preferred a PFS presentation over VRRs.PFS vaccines can help vaccine administrators save time on preparation resulting in nearly quadruple their hourly vaccine preparation rate compared to VRRs."

Importantly, the research also concentrates on pinpointing critical elements that affect OHSS.Method This retrospective study employed a ML framework to predict complicated OHSS in patients undergoing infertility treatment. The dataset included various patient characteristics, treatment details, ovarian response variables, oocyte quality indicators, embryonic development metrics, sperm quality assessments, and treatment specifics. The target variable was OHSS, categorized as painless, mild, moderate, or severe. The ML framework incorporated Ray Tune for hyperparameter tuning and SMOTE-variants for addressing data imbalance. Multiple ML models were applied, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge Regression, KNN, and SGD. The models were integrated into a voting classifier, and the optimization process was conducted. The SHAP package was used to interpret model outcomes and feature contributions.Results The best model incorporated IPADE-ID augmentation along with an ensemble of classifiers (SGDClassifier, SVC, RidgeClassifier), reaching a recall of 0.9 for predicting OHSS occurrence and an accuracy of 0.76. SHAP analysis identified key factors: GnRH antagonist use, longer stimulation, female infertility factors, irregular menses, higher weight, hCG triggers, and, notably, higher number of embryos.Conclusion This novel study demonstrates ML’s potential for predicting complicated OHSS. The optimized model provides insights into contributory factors, challenging certain conventional assumptions. The findings highlight the importance of considering patient-specific factors and treatment details in OHSS risk assessment."

In this study, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) of ADHD symptom measures, with an effective sample size of 120,092 (71,733 unique individuals from 28 population-based cohorts, with 288,887 quantitative ADHD symptom measures). Next, we meta-analyzed the results with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ADHD diagnosis. The GWAMA of ADHD symptoms returned no genome-wide significant variants. However, we estimated strong genetic correlations between our study of quantitative ADHD symptoms and the earlier study of ADHD diagnosis (rg= 1.00, SE= 0.06). Moderate negative genetic correlations (rg< -0.40) were observed with several cognitive traits. Genetic correlations between ADHD and aggressive behavior and antisocial behavior were around 1. This provides further evidence of the wide pleiotropic effects of genetic variants and the role that genetic variants play in the co-occurrence with (mental) health traits. The GWAMAs of ADHD symptoms and diagnosis identified 2,039 genome-wide significant variants, representing 39 independent loci, of which 17 were new. Using a novel fine-mapping and functional annotation method, we identified 22 potential effector genes which implicate several new potential biological processes and pathways that may play a role in ADHD. Our findings support the notion that clinical ADHD is at the extreme end of a continuous liability that is indexed by ADHD symptoms. We show that including ADHD symptom counts in large-scale GWAS can be useful to identify novel genes implicated in ADHD and related symptoms."

This study evaluates the harmonisation of health and humanitarian aid in Syria during acute humanitarian and health crises from 2011 to 2019.Methods Data on humanitarian and health aid for Syria between 2011 and 2019 was collected from the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) to assess the harmonisation of aid. The data was linked to four key indicators of the conflict: the number of IDPs; the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance; the number or frequency of internal movements (displacements) by individuals; and the decline in Syria’s population between 2011 and 2019. This was compared to data from highly fragile states and stable low- and middle-income countries. Four focus group discussions and four key informants’ interviews with humanitarian practitioners were also conducted.Results The findings suggest that overall aid harmonisation did not occur and importantly did not correlate with increased humanitarian needs. During the first five years, humanitarian and health pooled funds (which endorse aid harmonisation) in Syria were nearly entirely absent, far less than those in low- and middle-income countries and highly fragile states. However, from 2016 to 2019, a visible surge in humanitarian pooled funds indicated an increase in the harmonisation of donors’ efforts largely influenced by adopting the Whole-of-Syria approach in 2015 as a positive result of the cross-border UN Security Council resolution in 2014.Conclusion Harmonisation of aid within the Syrian crisis was found to have little correlation with the crisis parameters and population needs, instead aligning more with donor policies. Assessing fragmentation solely at the donor level is also insufficient. Aid effectiveness should be assessed with the inclusion of community engagement and aid beneficiary perspectives. Harmonisation mechanisms must be disentangled from international politics to improve aid effectiveness. In Syria, this study calls for finding and supporting alternative humanitarian coordination and funding mechanisms that are not dependent on the persistent limitations of the UN Security Council.What is already known on this topic Leading aid agencies must coordinate their policies to manage complex humanitarian and health needs. Yet, the impact of crisis-relevant indicators such as internal displacement trends, and population needs assessments remain underexplored, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR).What this study adds Harmonisation of aid in the Syrian crisis did not align with crisis indicators or population needs, but rather with donor policies, creating challenges in the transition from conflict to early recovery. In addition, the applicability of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness is less relevant in conflict-affected areas, given that it supposes the existence of a legitimate government and leading aid agencies should collaborate to achieve development goals. However, in complex conflicts, governments may have limited control over resources and legitimacy is subsequently questionable.How this study might affect research, practice or policy This study highlights the need for continuous UN cross-border coordination mechanisms, finding another model than ‘the consent model’ for cross-border humanitarian aid for northwest Syria to protect local communities from ‘aid weaponisation’, and support the newly established Aid Fund for Northern Syria (AFNS), expand its coverage to include northeast Syria and improve its policy to include more development health aid and localisation agenda."

While the major focus was on diagnosis and treatment of the acute phase of the disease, many individuals experienced long-term health even after recovery. These post-COVID-19 conditions encompass a broad range of physical, psychological, and cognitive symptoms that persist beyond the acute phase of the illness. The aim of this study was to find the prevalence and reported presentations of post-COVID-19 conditions in Nepal.Method This is a retrospective cross-sectional study using structured questionnaire to collect hospital-based data available in the record of Curative Service Division, Department of Health Services of Nepal from October 2021 to September 2022. A total of 6151 cases were recorded in the study. Descriptive analysis was done for demographic and symptoms variable. Association of variables to post-COVID-19 condition are shown using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.Results Among 6151 respondents (62.25% males), more than half (59.03%) had at least one symptom after recovery from acute COVID-19. The most common symptoms were anxiety (28.5%), loss of appetite (25.3%), shortness of breath (24.13%), fatigue (23.24%), depressed mood (18.79%), muscle ache (17.59%), chest pain (16.81%), headache (14.78%), and palpitation (13%). Multivariate analysis showed increased odds of post-COVID-19 conditions in smokers (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.53), those with chronic lung disease (aOR 1.71), neurological disorder (aOR 2.43) and those with use of supplementary oxygen during acute illness of COVID-19 (aOR 3.37).Conclusion The prevalence of post-COVID-19 symptoms among the study population is found to be high. The main symptoms from our study and similar studies are anxiety, fatigue, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, muscle pain, headaches. Patients with smoking, hypoxia during acute illness and presence of chronic lung disease and neurological disorder had higher odds of getting post-COVID-19 conditions. Citing the findings, health system should focus upon the management and recording of such conditions for further evidence."

Malawi has a high HIV prevalence and struggles with retention despite significant progress in controlling the epidemic. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, such as two-way texting (2wT), have shown promise in improving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) retention. We explore the cost-effectiveness of a 2wT intervention in Lighthouse Trust’s Martin Preuss Center (MPC) in Lilongwe, Malawi, that sends automated SMS visit reminders, weekly motivational messages, and supports direct communication between clients and healthcare workers.Methods Costs and retention rates were compared between 2wT and standard of care (SOC) for 468 clients enrolled in each. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Scenario analyses were conducted to estimate costs if 2wT expanded.Results The 2wT group had higher retention (80%) than SOC (67%) at 12 months post-ART initiation. For 468 clients, the total annual costs for 2wT were $36,670.38 as compared to SOC costs at $33,458.72, resulting in an ICER of $24,705. Among scenarios, the ICER was -$105,315 if 2wT expanded to all new clients (2678 at MPC and -$723,739 as 2wT expanded to other four high-burden facilities (2901 clients), suggesting high cost savings if 2wT was effectively scaled.Conclusion The 2wT intervention appears cost-effective to improve ART retention among new ART initiates in a high-burden ART clinic. While mHealth interventions have potential limitations, their benefits in improving patient outcomes and cost savings support their integration into HIV care programs."

The outbreak, peaking in August, predominantly impacted children and individuals with compromised immunity. Clinical manifestations included sudden-onset redness, foreign body sensation, watery discharge, and occasional lid swelling. A majority of cases exhibited acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, with management involving ocular lubricants, personal hygiene, and topical antibiotics. This study details the genomic epidemiology and clinical characteristics of conjunctivitis cases during the outbreak. To understand the causative agents, conjunctival swabs from patients were evaluated using unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in Illumina iSeq100 at Dhulikhel Hospital Kathmandu University Hospital. This case series revealed the presence of Enterovirus C (coxsackievirus strain A24) as the major pathogen responsible for the outbreak. This case series contributes valuable insights into the genomic diversity of conjunctivitis-associated viruses, highlighting the potential of mNGS in enhancing diagnostic capabilities and guiding public health responses."

However, battery depletion poses a significant clinical and economic burden; extended service life may reduce costs due to generator changes and associated complications. The purpose of this study was to estimate the potential cost-savings associated with extended battery longevity in a Medicare patient population receiving CRT-D implantation.Methods A decision tree was used to explore three battery capacities, which represent the leading device manufacturers available in the US: 1.0 ampere-hours (Ah), 1.6Ah, and 2.1Ah. Yearly risk of all-cause mortality, device-related complications, and end of battery life were estimated. Over a time horizon of 6 years, estimated costs included device implantation, replacement, follow-up appointments, and complications. Costs were discounted at 3%. Univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis was completed for patient survival, battery survival, complication incidence and costs, procedure costs, and time horizon.Results In the base-case, the average total costs to Medicare over 6 years were $41,527, $48,515, and $56,647 per person (USD 2023) for the 2.1Ah, 1.6Ah, and 1.0Ah devices, respectively. The total per-person replacement cost for the 1.0Ah devices was more than 4 times that of the 2.1Ah devices ($20,126 versus $5,006). When extrapolated to the total number of CRT-D implants each year over a 6-year period, the difference in costs between the extended (2.1Ah) and lowest (1.0Ah) battery capacity exceeded $500 million.Conclusions Extended longevity CRT-D batteries demonstrate significant cost savings to Medicare over 6 years compared to those with lower battery capacity. These data indicate long-term economic considerations should be included in device selection."

In this study, we describe the cases of NTMs identified during the first national anti-TB drug-resistance survey conducted in Mali, and associated risk factors.Methods Sputum was collected from people presenting for pulmonary TB diagnosis, from April to December 2019, regardless of age. Microscopy-positive patients were enrolled and were tested by GeneXpert MTB/RIF. Cases that tested negative for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBc) were tested for presence of mycobacteria by amplification of the IS6110 and 16SrRNA genes through double quantitative real-time PCR, followed by nested PCR and Sanger sequencing of the IS6110-negative samples for NTM species identification.Results A total of 1,418 sputum smear-positive patients were enrolled, including 1,199 new cases, 211 previously treated cases and 8 whose previous treatment history was unknown. Based on the results of GeneXpert MTB/RIF and in-house PCR methods, 1331 (93.9%) patients were positive for MTBc, 48 (3.4%) for NTMs and for 39 (2.7%) no species identification was possible. Advanced age (65 and over) (OR 8.8, p=0.001) and previous TB treatment (OR 3.4 and p=0.016) were the risk factors statistically associated with NTM detection. M. avium complex (MAC) was the predominant NTM species, detected in 20 cases.Conclusion Detection of NTMs in people presumed to have TB is an ongoing challenge, confounding correct TB diagnosis. Concomitant use of microscopy and GeneXpert testing among at-risk individuals could lessen confusion."

To select participants, a systematic random sampling method was employed. Demographic data was collected using a structured questionnaire and fasting blood samples were taken to measure glycemic and lipid levels. Blood pressure and adiposity indices were measured during recruitment. The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was defined using Framingham scores and standard low-density lipoprotein thresholds. To analyze the data, k-means clustering algorithms and regression analysis were used.Results The study identified three groups in female patients according to body mass index, relative fat mass, glycated hemoglobin, and triglyceride-glucose index. These groups included the obesity-related phenotype, the severe insulin resistance phenotype, and the normal weight phenotype with improved insulin resistance. Among male patients with T2DM, two groups were identified, including the obesity-related phenotype with severe insulin resistance and the normal weight phenotype with improved insulin sensitivity. The severe insulin resistance phenotype in female patients was associated with an increased risk of high CVD (OR=5.34, 95%CI:2.11-13.55) and MetS (OR=7.07; 95%CI:3.24-15.42). Among male patients, the obesity-related phenotype with severe insulin resistance was associated with an increased intermediate (OR=21.78, 95%CI:4.17-113.78) and a high-risk CVD (OR=6.84, 95%CI:1.45-32.12).Conclusions The findings suggest that there are specific subgroups of patients with T2DM characterized by obesity and uncontrolled insulin resistance leading to poor glycemic control. This underscores the importance of considering differences in adiposity, insulin secretion, and sensitivity indices when making clinical decisions for patients with T2DM."

Poor outcomes are driven by maladaptive inflammatory and thrombotic host responses. Effective therapies that modulate host responses are lacking. Anti-platelet medications modulate thrombotic and inflammatory pathways and improve long term outcomes in COVID-19 pneumonia, however, the role of anti-platelets in other etiologies of CAP remains uncertain.Methods We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies including adult patients hospitalized for non-COVID-19 community acquired pneumonia (CAP) investigating the effect of anti-platelets (ASA or P2Y12 inhibitors) vs. control on all-cause mortality. We will search electronic databases including MEDLINE® (Epub Ahead of Print and In-Process, In-Data-Review & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), clinical trial registries (clinicaltrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and conference abstracts from inception to August 2023. Two blinded reviewers will extract data in parallel from included studies after title and abstract screening and application of eligibility criteria. We will use the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and study quality from included studies. The primary meta-analysis will be conducted separately for RCTs and observational studies using Random effect inverse variance model. For observational studies, adjusted mortality estimates will be presented as hazard ratios (HR) or adjusted odds ratios (OR) whenever possible. Heterogeneity will be expressed using the I2 statistic. The evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework.Discussion The overall treatment effect and safety of anti-platelets in non-COVID-19 CAP will be summarized. The findings may be used to inform the relevance and potential study design of a future RCT evaluating anti-platelets in CAP. If anti-platelets are shown to be safe and effective, this research is expected to contribute to a new standard of treatment for CAP, and a paradigm shift towards targeting host responses in serious infections.Systematic Review Registration This protocol is reported in accordance with the guidelines produced by PRISMA-P.

Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW) is a controversial diagnosis advocated by patients with prolonged TCS exposure who report severe systemic reactions upon treatment cessation. However, to date there have been no systematic clinical or mechanistic studies to distinguish TSW from other eczematous disorders.Methods A re-analysis of a previous survey with eczematous skin disease was performed to evaluate potential TSW distinguishing symptoms. We subsequently conducted a pilot study of 16 patients fitting the proposed diagnostic criteria. We then performed: tissue metabolomics, transcriptomics, and immunostaining on skin biopsies; serum metabolomics and cytokine assessments; shotgun metagenomics on microbiome skin swabs; genome sequencing; followed by functional, mechanistic studies using human skin cell lines and mice.Results Clinically distinct TSW symptoms included burning, flushing, and thermodysregulation. Metabolomics and transcriptomics both implicated elevated NAD+ oxidation stemming from increased expression of mitochondrial complex I and conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine metabolites. These abnormalities were induced by glucocorticoid exposure both in vitro and in a cohort of healthy controls (N=19) exposed to TCS. Targeting complex I via either metformin or the herbal compound berberine improved outcomes in both cell culture and in an open-label case series for patients with TSW.Conclusion Taken together, our results suggest that TSW has a distinct dermatopathology. While future studies are needed to validate these results in larger cohorts, this work provides the first mechanistic evaluation into TSW pathology, and offers insights into clinical identification, pharmacogenomic candidates, and directed therapeutic strategies."

In this paper, we propose a general framework for evaluating the efficacy of these foundation models in medicine, suggesting that they should be assessed across three dimensions: general performance, bias/fairness, and the influence of confounders. Utilizing Google’s recently released dermatology embedding model and lesion diagnostics as examples, we demonstrate that: 1) dermatology foundation models surpass state-of-the-art classification accuracy; 2) general-purpose CLIP models encode features informative for medical applications and should be more broadly considered as a baseline; 3) skin tone is a key differentiator for performance, and the potential bias associated with it needs to be quantified, monitored, and communicated; and 4) image quality significantly impacts model performance, necessitating that evaluation results across different datasets control for this variable. Our findings provide a nuanced view of the utility and limitations of large-scale foundation models for medical AI."

Within households, transmission may be highly variable because of differing transmission risks by age, household size, and individual contagiousness. Our aim was to disentangle those factors by fitting mathematical models to SARS-CoV-2 household survey and serologic data. We surveyed members of 3,381 Utah households from January-April 2021 and performed SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing on all available members. We paired these data with a probabilistic model of household importation and transmission composed of a novel combination of transmission variability and age- and size-structured heterogeneity. We calculated maximum likelihood estimates of mean and variability of household transmission probability between household members in different age groups and different household sizes, simultaneously with importation probability and probabilities of false negative and false positive test results. 12.8% of the individual participants showed serologic evidence of prior infection or reported a prior positive test on the survey, and 17.4% of the participating households showed evidence of at least one SARS-CoV-2 importation. Serologically positive individuals in younger age groups were less likely than older adults to have tested positive during their infection according to our survey results. Our model results suggested that adolescents and young adults (ages 13-24) acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection outside the household at a rate substantially higher than younger children and older adults. Our estimate of the household secondary attack rate (HSAR) among adults aged 45 and older exceeded HSARs to and/or from younger age groups. We found lower HSAR in households with more members, independent of age differences. Our findings from age-structured transmission analysis suggest that age groups contact each other at different rates within households, a key insight for understanding community outbreak patterns and mechanisms of differential infection risk.Author Summary Infectious diseases can spread through human communities in irregular patterns, partly because different demographic groups, such as age groups, experience different transmission risks due to contact or other behavioral or physiological differences. Understanding the factors driving age differences in transmission can help predict patterns of disease spread and suggest efficient public health strategies to mitigate outbreaks. Households are inter-age mixing locations where age differences in transmission can be studied. In early 2021, we collected blood samples from all members of thousands of households in Utah and tested them for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, from which prior COVID-19 infection can be inferred. We paired these data with mathematical models that quantify probabilities that different combinations of household members end up infected for different assumptions about non-household infection and within-household transmission. Our estimates suggest that adolescents and young adults acquired infection outside the household more frequently than did other age groups. After a household importation occurred, middle-aged and older adults living together transmitted to each other more readily than all other age pairings for a given household size. The age patterns of household transmission we found suggest that within-household contact rate differences play a significant role in driving household transmission epidemiology."

In Senegal, SMC implementation began in 2013 and is given to children under 10 years old. This study aimed to describe clinical malaria incidence in the general population during routine SMC implementation and to analyse how SMC timing impacted clinical malaria dynamics in eligible children.We conducted an ecological study in the Kedougou region of Senegal in 27 villages included in the Bandafassi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS). We calculated weekly Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence by age group using malaria case data recorded by community health workers and health-posts, and population denominators obtained from Bandafassi Health and Demographic Surveillance System. We used negative binomial generalized additive multilevel models to analyse the incidence of clinical episodes in children under 10 years during the expected SMC prophylactic period and at the end of the transmission period.Malaria incidence was strongly seasonal with a high transmission period starting in June. Children under SMC presented an overall lower incidence compared to older children and young adults. Among children eligible for SMC, the incidence was lowest for approximately 3 weeks after treatment administration and increased subsequently, suggesting a gradual loss of protection. At the end of the high transmission period, a higher malaria incidence was recorded from the 3rd to 6th week after the week of administration of the fourth (final) SMC round.While protecting children under 10 years, SMC warrants adjustment to reduce exposure before the next round, to increase protection of 5-9 years, and to cover the high transmission period completely. The addition of a 5th round of SMC in 2023 was necessary to cover the end of the transmission season, but individual-level studies are required to ensure that drug efficacy and adequate dosing are maintained."

Consenting patients were provided the Frame Your Future weblink to complete the digital risk assessment followed by virtual counseling, and their family physicians were provided with a pdf summary to discuss during the primary care encounter. Demographic and clinical information was collected via medical record abstraction and patient and physician experiences via survey.Results Of 46 enrolled patients, 44 (96%) made a Frame account, 38 (86%) completed the risk assessment, 34 (89%) completed virtual coaching, and 24 (71%) had a physician discuss their preconception health assessment during the primary care encounter. Nearly 80% of patients reported an increase in confidence in discussing fertility with their physician, and 50% reported they would not otherwise have brought up fertility and preconception health during the encounter. Both patients and physicians were satisfied with the process and viewed it as helping motivate positive changes in patient health and health behaviors.Conclusion The completion of preconception digital risk assessment and virtual counseling facilitates discussion of preconception health during primary care encounters and shows promise for improving women’s health."

The Canadian Bronchiolitis Epinephrine Steroid Trial (CanBEST) assessed whether administering epinephrine alone, dexamethasone alone, or in combination (EpiDex) could reduce bronchiolitis-related hospitalizations among children less than 12 months of age compared to placebo. CanBEST demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in 7-day hospitalization risk with EpiDex in an unadjusted analysis but not after adjustment.Objective To explore the probability that EpiDex results in a reduction in hospitalizations using Bayesian methods.Study Design Using prior distributions that represent varying levels of preexisting enthusiasm or skepticism and information about the treatment effect before data were collected, the Bayesian distribution of the relative risk of hospitalization compared to placebo was determined. The probability that the treatment effect is less 1, 0.9, 0.8 and 0.6, indicating increasing reductions in hospitalization risk, are computed alongside 95% credible intervals.Results Combining a minimally informative prior distribution with the data from CanBEST provides comparable results to the original analysis. Unless strongly skeptical views about the effectiveness of EpiDex were considered, the 95% credible interval for the treatment effect lies below 1, indicating a reduction in hospitalizations. There is a 90% probability that EpiDex results in a clinically meaningful reduction in hospitalization of 10% even when incorporating skeptical views, with a 67% probability when considering strongly skeptical views.Conclusion A Bayesian analysis demonstrates a high chance that EpiDex reduces hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis, although strongly skeptical individuals may require additional evidence to change practice."

In response to the rise in prevalence, governments have introduced legislation to curb the supply of e-cigarettes to adolescents. To supplement these legislation measures, leading (inter)national public health agencies have called for the development of education and communication programs aimed at reducing adolescent e-cigarette uptake. Text-message programs for adolescents represent a potentially potent approach to achieve this. In this study, we assessed the acceptability of text-messages sent to adolescents and their parents to target factors associated with e-cigarette use. Text-messages were found to be acceptable to both adolescents and their parents however the effectiveness of the program on adolescent e-cigarette use still needs to be established prior to broader scale-up and investment."

In this study, we have translated and culturally adapted the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7) into Kinyarwanda and performed a validation study in a United States (US) primary care setting.Methods A committee of experts translated and culturally adapted the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, incorporating feedback from cognitive interviews with bilingual participants. The translated instruments were then tested in a cross-sectional validation study. Analyses include internal consistency, discriminative validity, principal component analyses, and confirmatory factor analyses.Results Analyses of 119 responses indicated overall good internal consistency with Cronbach’s α of 0.85 (PHQ-9) and 0.92 (GAD-7). Both scales showed acceptable factor loadings between 0.44 and 0.90 in the principal component analyses and showed strong correlations with health-related quality of life and depression/anxiety symptoms measured with visual analog scales. Significantly higher scores for PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were shown among participants with known psychiatric conditions.Discussion PHQ-9 and GAD-7 demonstrated commendable applicability for Kinyarwanda-speaking patients in primary healthcare settings in the US. Culturally adapted translations of these tools may aid in mitigating health disparities among refugee and migrant populations. Future research should further validate these tools against gold-standard diagnostics in larger, geographically diverse samples."

These attitudes and behaviors are often influenced by various information sources, most prominently by social media platforms.The primary information usually comes from government bodies, e.g. CDC, responsible for public health mandates. However, social media can amplify, modify, or distort this information in numerous ways. The dual nature of social media can either raise awareness and encourage protective behaviors and reduce transmission, or have the opposite effect by spreading misinformation and fostering non-compliance.To analyze the interplay between these components, we have developed a coupled SIR-type dynamical model that integrates three essential components: (i) disease spread, as reported by official sources; (ii) the response of social media to this information; and (iii) the subsequent modification of human behavior, which directly impacts the spread of disease.To calibrate and validate our model, we utilized available data sources on the Covid-19 pandemic from a one-year period (2021-2022) in the United States, as well as data on social media responses, particularly tweets. By analyzing the data and conducting model simulations, we have identified significant inputs and parameters, such as initial compliance levels and behavioral transition rates. These factors enable a quantitative assessment of their contributions to disease outcomes, including cumulative outbreak size and its dynamic trajectory.This modeling approach gives some valuable insights into the relationship between public attitudes, information dissemination, and their impact on the progression of the pandemic. By understanding these dynamics, we can inform policy decisions, public health campaigns, and interventions to effectively combat the spread of Covid-like pathogens and future pandemics."

Now para aortic nodal failure and distant metastasis are the predominant modes of failure. Paraaortic nodal failure rates are higher in pelvic node-positive cases as compared to pelvic node-negative cases as demonstrated in EMBRACE studies. The current study aims to find out the benefit of adding prophylactic para-aortic node irradiation in patients of carcinoma cervix who have involved pelvic nodes on volumetric imaging.Method This will be a two-arm, parallel group, phase II open-label multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients will be enrolled in a phase II trial where the primary endpoint will be demonstration of reduction in the risk of para-aortic recurrence.If the primary endpoint is met, a phase III trial will be initiated using the same trial design and intervention. Patients in arm A(control arm) will receive pelvic radiotherapy covering the common iliac nodes with Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) to a dose of 45 Gy/25 fractions over five weeks. Radiologically involved lymph nodes will be boosted to a dose of 55 Gy/25 fractions with simultaneous integrated boost(SIB).Patients in arm B (Experimental arm)will receive pelvic and elective para-aortic radiotherapy up to the lower border of the renal vein (IMRT) to dose of 45 Gy/25 fractions over five weeks.Radiologically involved lymph nodes will be boosted to a dose of 55 Gy/25 fractions with simultaneous integrated boost(SIB). Concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin 40mg/m2 weekly will be given during external beam radiotherapy in both the arms. After completion of concurrent chemoradiation, high dose rate (HDR) intracavitary or intracavitary +interstitial brachytherapy will be performed in both the arms.With a one sided type I error of 5% and a power of 80%, a total of 9 para-aortic recurrences is required to demonstrated that addition of prophylactic para-aortic nodal recurrence reduces the the risk of a para-aortic nodal failure from 10% in the control arm to 2% or less in the test arm. Without a substantial reduction in the risk of para-aortic nodal failure, an improvement in overall survival cannot be expected. 224 patients will need to be accrued over a period of 2 years with a minimum follow up of 12 months to demonstrate this number of para-aortic nodal recurrences for the phase II trial.For the current study we will assume that the 5 year overall survival is 70% in the control arm and that use of prophylactic EFRT will translate into an absolute improvement of 9% in the overall survival. This implies that the test arm will have a 5 year overall survival of about 79%. This corresponds to a hazard ratio of 0.75 which is a conservative estimate of the possible relative benefit of extended field radiotherapy. With a two sided type I error of 5% and a power of 80%, a total of 143 events is required to demonstrate an improvement in the overall survival corresponding to the hazard ratio of 0.75. This would need a total accrual duration of 5 years, and a minimum follow up duration of 4 years (such that the total trial duration of 9 years), a total of 462 patients (equal allocation) need to be accrued. Assuming a 15% loss to follow up, a total sample size of 530 patients is needed corresponding to an annual accrual of 106 patients..Discussion This trial will demonstrate the efficacy of prophylactic para aortic radiation in pelvic node positive carcinoma cervix. It also gives an opportunity to standardize and assess the quality-assurance radiotherapy practices in carcinoma cervix across multiple premier institutes of the nation at the same time.The safety of this intervention in advanced pelvic node-positive disease requiring prophylactic para aortic radiation will be established.Trial Registration The trial has been registered at the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) vide registration number: CTRI/2023/08/057075(30th August 2023)"

This study aimed to develop and benchmark multi-ancestry PRS models capable of predicting disease risk across diverse populations. Leveraging trans-ethnic GWAS meta-analysis, we generated novel summary statistics for 30 medically-related traits and assessed the predictive performance of four PRS algorithms. Algorithm efficacy across traits varied, with Stacked C+T (SCT) performing better when trait prevalence was higher, while LDpred and Lassosum performed better when trait prevalence was lower. Subsequent integration of PRS algorithm outputs through logistic regression and incorporation of additional medical information enhanced model accuracy. Notably, including ancestry information further improved predictive performance, underscoring its importance in PRS model development. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-ancestry PRS models in clinical settings, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and broad applicability across different ancestral backgrounds."

This is primarily due to their low biomass, which presents inadvertent operational contamination as a significant experimental obstacle. The critical role of the tissue microbiomes in cancer development has brought this topic to the forefront of cancer research. However, a fundamental question regarding the potential biodiversity, as stated in the title, has not been addressed to our knowledge. In this study, we estimate the potential microbial diversity or “dark” biodiversity in human tumor and normal tissues using the Diversify-Area Relationship (DAR) method (Ma 2018, 2019) based on large datasets from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database (Poore et al. 2021). We found that the total species richness (number), typical species equivalents (number), and dominant species equivalents (number) of tumor tissues are approximately 1948, 36, and 22, respectively. Among the total species richness, the proportions of archaea, bacteria, and viruses are about 3%-5%, 78%-79%, and 17%-18%, respectively. Moreover, the tissue species richness is approximately 12.5% of skin microbiomes, and 25% of gut microbiomes. We also found that tumor growth does not significantly influence the global or pan-tumor scale diversity, which means that the previous numbers also represent the potential microbial diversity of human tissues, including blood. On a local or single cancer-type scale, tumors may influence the potential diversity in approximately 5% of cases. We hypothesize that, globally, local diversity variations would offset each other.Lay Summary This study focused on microbiomes - the tiny microbes that live in our tissues, especially blood. Studying them is challenging due to their low biomass and risk of contamination. Microbiomes may play a key role in cancer, but their diversity within tissues remains unclear. Using diversity-area relationship modeling with data from “The Cancer Genome Atlas” database, we estimated the potential microbial diversity of human tumor and normal tissues. We found approximately 1,948 microbial species in tumors, comprising archaea (5%), bacteria (78%) and viruses (17%). However, dominant or common microbial species number only about two to three dozen. Tissue microbe diversity was 12.5% of that found in skin microbiomes and 25% of gut microbiomes. Tumor growth did not significantly impact overall diversity. Therefore, the previous diversity numbers also represent the microbiome diversity of general human tissues and blood. However, some cancer types may affect it locally. While local diversity changes can occur, globally these variations between tissues likely balance out."

This commitment recognizes not only the ethical imperative of inclusivity but also the practical necessity to ensure the safety and efficacy of medications across all demographic groups. Particularly for Phase 3 and pivotal clinical trials, the FDA has issued draft guidance that recommends sponsors to develop diversity plans with race and ethnicity (R/E) enrollment targets informed by the epidemiological landscape of the disease in the therapy’s target population. For biomarker-driven oncology trials, real-world data (RWD), especially when enriched with multimodal clinico-genomic information, holds immense promise for informing these R/E enrollment goals.However, leveraging RWD comes with hurdles, including the overrepresentation of insured patients, significant non-random missingness in R/E data, and disparities between R/E distributions in RWD and disease incidence databases—often attributed to healthcare access and socioeconomic disparities. Here, we propose a robust methodology to harness clinico-genomic RWD, addressing these challenges through strategies that include accurate R/E imputation and incidence adjustment factors. Our approach then utilizes clinical data and biomarker prevalence in RWD to derive a data-driven R/E distribution for clinical trial enrollment targets.Through a case study on a hypothetical biomarker-driven clinical trial targeting prostate adenocarcinoma and leveraging a cohort from the Tempus clinco-genomic database, we demonstrate the application of our methodology. This example illustrates the potential of RWD to offer enrollment target scenarios, grounded in disease epidemiology and empirical R/E distributions adjusted for biomarker prevalence. Such data-driven targets are pivotal for the development of informed and equitable diversity plans in oncology clinical trials, paving the way for more representative and generalizable research outcomes."

Accurate neighborhood-level forecasts are critical for planning more equitable resource allocation; however, such spatially high-resolution forecasts remain scarce in operational use. Here, we analyze aggregated foot traffic data derived from mobile devices to measure the connectivity among 42 NYC neighborhoods driven by various human activities such as dining, shopping, and entertainment. Using real-world time-varying contact patterns in different place categories, we develop a parsimonious behavior-driven epidemic model that incorporates population mixing, indoor crowdedness, dwell time, and seasonality of virus transmissibility. This process-based model supports accurate modeling of neighborhood-level SARS-CoV-2 transmission throughout 2020. In the best-fitting model, we estimate that the force of infection in indoor settings increases sublinearly with crowdedness and dwell time. Retrospective forecasting demonstrates that this behavior-driven model generates improved short-term forecasts in NYC neighborhoods. This model may be adapted for use with other respiratory pathogens sharing similar transmission routes."

Community health workers (CHWs) face work-related burnout. This study used a survey instrument to identify facilitators and barriers to a health crisis or pandemic preparedness. Causes of burnout and factors of crisis readiness were examined, including CHWs’ health status, readiness to use technology, and organisational culture. Findings suggest that more technology training and organisational support are needed to develop a resilient healthcare system. Increased workloads and demanding work schedules contribute to burnout, highlighting the need for support resources to promote the physical and mental health of CHWs. The study also collected data on CHWs’ perspectives on organisational commitment and individual innovation behaviours. The sample population is motivated to try new ideas and work methods to meet dynamic challenges and work expectations. Despite systemic shortcomings, more than 50% of them can envision a career with their community health organisation. Therefore, collaborative efforts are needed to create a work environment that promotes the physical well-being and professional development of CHWs. It is of practical importance for managers to value fostering innovation and organisational commitment in their healthcare workforce. In addition, our study is relevant to policymakers at local and central levels to plan national programmes for crisis preparedness and building a healthy nation."

In Tanzania, where alcohol use disorders rates are twice the overall African average, harmful alcohol consumption is a public health concern. Given the lack of a contemporary overview of the alcohol policy landscape, we conducted a mixed-methods review of key alcohol-related policies, implementers, and initiatives in Tanzania. We conducted a desk-based review of policy-related documents, and in-depth interviews with eight key informants guided by the 10-composite-indicator framework of a tool for measuring alcohol policy implementation developed by World Health Organization. Representatives were from health-service delivery, community-based organizations, governmental organizations, research, and policymakers whose work is related to alcohol in Tanzania. Data was collected in October 2021, June 2022, and finalized in March 2023. Findings were analyzed using Microsoft Word v2021. Themes were identified, collected, combined, and tabulated. Differences were then resolved by first and second authors. Our findings revealed no single comprehensive national alcohol policy. Pending finalization of a draft policy, various documents and actors govern alcohol production, distribution, licensing, and consumption. Little intersectoral linkage between entities contributes to poor enforcement of these regulations. Regulation is stronger in urban areas, and restrictions more effective on industrial alcohol. However, the majority of consumed alcohol in Tanzania is informally-produced, especially in rural settings. Socio-cultural context plays a key role in alcohol production and consumption, contributing to early-age exposure to alcohol. Alcohol is a growing source of revenue for the Tanzanian government and, therefore, imposing further restrictions is a low priority. There are important policy gaps in various sectors pertaining to alcohol regulation. Our results strongly suggest the need for a comprehensive approach to developing an overarching alcohol policy, with involvement of key stakeholders, stronger enforcement, and increased awareness, resources, and collaborations."

However, the relationship to sarcopenia and determinants of MM volume (MMV) in the general older population remain unclear.Mabethod In a cross-sectional study of 1484 older adults of Tokyo, we evaluated MMV using 3D MRI scanning, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM), handgrip strength, dietary intake, smoking, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, and the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism. Participants were divided into quintiles based on MMV (Q1-5).Results Our study of participants with a mean age of 73.0 ± 5.3 years, MMV (Men:35.3 ± 7.8 ml, Women: 25.0 ± 5.1 ml) was significantly larger in men than in women. A significant association between MMV and sarcopenia was observed, with the lowest quintile (Q1) showing a higher risk compared to the highest quintile (Q5) in both sexes. Body mass index (BMI) and age were independent determinants of ASMM in both sexes, while BMI, but interestingly not age, was a determinant of MMV. Moreover, IGF-1 was positively correlated with MMV in both sexes; smoking negatively correlated with MMV in women. The ACTN3 577X polymorphism was associated with only smaller MMV in men.Conclusion Low MMV increased the risk of sarcopenia, particularly in men. BMI and age strongly influenced ASMM, while MMV was only weakly associated with BMI and not with age. Notably, the IGF-1 level was positively correlated to only MMV, and the ACTN3 genotype was linked to reduced only MMV in men."

Despite the availability of ARVs at community, secondary, and tertiary health facilities in Nigeria, adherence rates remain low. This study conducted in Ibadan, Nigeria, investigated factors influencing adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV patients.Methods The research employed a cross-sectional approach, utilizing qualitative techniques, including in-depth interviews (IDI) with patients and key informant interviews (KII) with healthcare providers and pharmacists. The target population consisted of HIV patients receiving ART at the Community Pharmacies and Public Hospital University in Ibadan. Data saturation determined sample sizes for the interviews.Results In the in-depth interviews, two primary themes emerged from the findings: “Socio-economic factors influencing adherence” and “Factors related to the process of care.” Socio-economic factors encompassed issues such as transportation costs, societal pressure, food costs, advice from third parties, and religious reasons. These factors were further categorized into economic reasons and societal pressure/misinformation, shedding light on patients’ challenges and choices. Factors related to the process of care included the cost of medication, side effects, drug-drug interactions, the quantity and duration of drug use, and discontinuation after feeling better.Key informant interviews with healthcare providers and pharmacists revealed insights into compliance by gender, financial constraints, and treatment-related factors such as side effects, drug interactions, and medication volume. Socio Cultural and religious factors, including advice from third parties, stigmatization, disclosure of status to partners, social support, and religious beliefs, played significant roles in influencing patients’ adherence.Conclusion These findings shed light on the complex interplay of factors affecting ART adherence and highlight the importance of considering economic, social, and medical aspects when designing interventions to improve adherence in HIV care. The study’s findings hold implications for healthcare programs and interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of care and support for HIV patients, particularly in resource-limited settings like Southwestern Nigeria."

Inclusion criteria was one atherosclerotic plaque inside the internal carotid artery, congruent with symptoms, which was causing a stenosis less than 50% (low-grade stenosis). Carotid plaque neovascularization scoring method was: score 0: no visible microbubbles within the plaque (A); score 1: minimal microbubbles confined to periadventitial (B); and score 2: microbubbles present throughout the plaque core (C). During the six-month follow-up, we checked TIA/stroke recurrences. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed.Results In our series, 22% of patients have CEUS score 0, 35% CEUS score 1, and 43% CEUS score 2. At six-month follow-up we found 21% TIA/stroke recurrences in CEUS score 2, despite of the ongoing best medical therapy as per guidelines. In Cox regression analysis, CEUS-detected neovascularization was independently associated with TIA/stroke recurrence (hazard ratio, 5.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–2.31).Conclusions Plaque neovascularization, detected by CEUS, is an independent predictor of TIA/stroke recurrence at six-month follow-up in patients with carotid atherosclerosis despite of low-grade stenosis."

The resulting disease has clinically similar manifestations to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) but worse clinical outcomes. Here we present the first comprehensive description of the transcriptomic characteristics of MPN-AP/BP. Our analysis incorporates data from 261 patients of the BeatAML cohort and 56 MPN-AP/BP patients, 11 of whom had paired samples from before and after transformation. We establish that transformed MPN is a transcriptionally distinct entity from de novo AML and chronic phase MPNs. Genomic pathways traditionally associated with MPN pathogenesis, such as IL2/STAT5 signaling, IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling, and NUP98/HOXA9 fusions, were enriched in chronic-phase MPNs but are absent in transformed disease, suggesting JAK2 directed therapy may be less effective in this disease phase. We also discovered that gene expression signatures associated with doxorubicin resistance are highly enriched in transformed MPNs, which may explain the lack of efficacy of standard AML therapies. In addition, we identify that lineage composition at the time of transformation may define distinct subsets of MPN-AP/BP patients, which may assist in the future development of novel treatment strategies.Key Points- Accelerated- and blast-phase transformed MPNs are a transcriptionally entities which are distinct from de novo AML.- Transformed MPNs may be characterized by their lineage characteristics, which can drive clinical behavior and account for their inferior overall survival- Gene expression signatures associated with doxorubicin resistance were highly enriched in transformed MPNs, which may explain the lack of effectiveness of anthracycline-based therapies"

Possible explanations include: rare infections in vaccinated individuals who did not gain immunity upon vaccination, made more common as the proportion of the population born before vaccination decreases; or waning of vaccine-induced immunity, which would present new challenges for measles control in near elimination settings.Methods To assess explanations for observed dynamics, we used a mathematical model stratified by age group, region and vaccine status, fitted to case data reported in England from 2010 to 2019. We evaluated whether models with or without waning were best able to capture the temporal dynamics of vaccinated cases in England.Findings Only models with waning of vaccine-induced immunity captured the number and distribution by age and year of vaccinated cases. The model without waning generated more single-vaccinated cases, and fewer double-vaccinated cases above 15 years-old than observed in the data (median: 73 cases in simulations without waning, 202 in the data, 187 when waning was included). The estimated waning rate was slow (95% credible interval: 0.036% to 0.044% per year in the best fitting model), but sufficient to increase measles burden because vaccinated cases were almost as likely to cause onwards transmission as unvaccinated cases (95% credible interval for risk of onwards transmission from vaccinated cases was only 7% to 21% lower relative to unvaccinated cases).Interpretation Measles case dynamics in England is consistent with waning of vaccine-induced immunity. Since measles is highly infectious, a slow waning leads to a heightened burden, with an increase in the number of both vaccinated and unvaccinated cases. Our findings show that the vaccine remains protective against measles infections for decades, but breakthrough infections are increasingly likely for individuals aged 15 and older.Funding National Institute for Health Research; Wellcome Trust.Evidence before this study We searched PubMed up to February 29, 2024, with no language restrictions using the following search terms: (measles) AND (“secondary vaccine failure” OR waning) AND (antibody OR “vaccine effectiveness”), and excluded studies that focused on waning of maternal antibodies in infants. We found evidence of waning of antibody concentration in young adults from laboratory data, but this may not translate into a loss of protection against infection. We also found estimates of vaccine effectiveness per age group from statistical analysis that used the total number of cases across various outbreaks rather than transmission dynamics. We did not identify any study estimating waning rate of measles vaccine from recent measles case dynamics.Added value of this study Our study uses measles case data from England, reported between 2010 and 2020. We show that the transmission dynamics in that time period was consistent with a waning of vaccine-induced immunity, making infection in young adults more common. We estimated that transmission from vaccinated cases was only slightly less common than transmission from unvaccinated cases. The increase in vaccinated cases and transmission from vaccinated cases increased the burden of measles in near-elimination settings.Implications of all the available evidence Our study shows that measles cases caused by waning of immunity are becoming more common. As the proportion of the overall population vaccinated against measles increases, and vaccine coverage dropped in many countries near elimination between 2020 and 2022, large outbreaks become more likely. Close monitoring of double-vaccinated cases is needed to assess their ability to cause onward transmission."

Exclusion criteria were studies with participants ineligible for cancer screening or without samples from TGD individuals, qualitative data, and cancer diagnosis from symptomatic presentation or incidental findings. A modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess risk of bias and reports rated poor were excluded. Results were synthesised through random-effects meta-analysis and narrative synthesis.Results Searches identified 25 eligible records, whereby 18 met risk of bias requirements. These were cross-sectional studies, including retrospective chart reviews and survey analyses, and encompassed over 14.8 million participants. The main outcomes measured were up-to-date (UTD) and lifetime (LT) attendance. Meta-analysis found differences for UTD cervical (OR=0.37, 95% CI [0.23, 0.60], p<0.0001) and mammography screening (OR=0.41, 95% CI [0.20, 0.87], p=0.02). There were no meaningful differences seen in LT results. Pooling total odds ratios for each synthesis (cervical, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer) showed reduced attendance in TGD participants (OR=0.50, 95% CI [0.37, 0.68], p<0.0001). Narrative synthesis of seven remaining articles supported meta-analysis results, finding generally reduced screening rates in TGD versus CG participants.Conclusions TGD individuals are overall less likely to utilise cancer screening compared to CG counterparts. The greatest disparity in attendance was seen specifically in UTD cervical screening. Limitations of this review included high risk of bias within studies, high heterogeneity, and a lack of resources for further statistical testing. Individual and structural factors such as psychological distress, socioeconomic status, and healthcare accessibility can prevent TGD people from accessing cancer screening. Bridging this gap will require consolidated efforts from healthcare systems including reviews of structural design, innovation of accessible and inclusive technology, education of HCPs, and reassessment of patient information resources. Joint production of future interventions with the TGD community is vital to improving both cancer screening experience and outcomes.Funding This work was supported by the INSPIRE grant generously awarded to the Hull York Medical School by the Academy of Medical Sciences through the Wellcome Trust [Ref: IR5\1018].Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42022368911.What is already known about this topic?Many transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) people experience difficulties accessing cancer screening and so face potentially increased risks in morbidity and mortality.What this study adds?This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated differences in attendance of cancer screening services between TGD and CG people and explored reasons underpinning present disparities.TGD individuals are less likely to attend cancer screening services overall, and are less likely to be up-to-date with breast and cervical cancer screening.How this study might affect research, practise of policy?To reduce inequities, individual and institutional barriers must be addressed through research, technological innovation, reviews of current structural design, and improved education.It is vital that future interventions for TGD people are jointly produced with the community to improve both cancer screening experience and outcomes."

While much of the evidence concerns depression, large-scale population studies of anxiety, affect, and cognitive function are scarce. Importantly, causality remains unclear. We used complementary non-genetic, genetic risk score (GRS), and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to examine whether inflammatory markers are associated with affect, depressive and anxiety disorders, and cognitive performance in the Lifelines Cohort; and whether associations are likely to be causal.Methods Using data from up to 55,098 (59% female) individuals from the Dutch Lifelines cohort, we tested the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of C-reactive protein (CRP) with (i) depressive and anxiety disorders; (ii) positive and negative affect scores, and (iii) five cognitive measures assessing attention, psychomotor speed, episodic memory, and executive functioning (figural fluency and working memory). Additionally, we examined the association between inflammatory marker GRSs (CRP, interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-6 receptor [IL-6R and soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R)], glycoprotein acetyls [GlycA]) on these same outcomes (Nmax=57,946), followed by MR analysis examining evidence of causality of CRP on outcomes (Nmax=23,268). In genetic analyses, all GRSs and outcomes were z-transformed.Results In non-genetic analyses, higher CRP was associated with diagnosis of any depressive disorder, lower positive and higher negative affect scores, and worse performance on tests of figural fluency, attention, and psychomotor speed after adjusting for potential confounders, although the magnitude of these associations was small. In genetic analyses, CRPGRS was associated with any anxiety disorder (β=0.002, p=0.037, N=57,047) whereas GlycAGRS was associated with major depressive disorder (β=0.001, p=0.036; N=57,047). Both CRPGRS (β=0.006, p=0.035, N=57,946) and GlycAGRS (β=0.006, p=0.049; N=57,946) were associated with higher negative affect score. Inflammatory marker GRSs were not associated with cognitive performance, except sIL-6RGRS which was associated with poorer memory performance (β=-0.009, p=0.018, N=36,783). Further examination of the CRP-anxiety association using MR provided some weak evidence of causality (β=0.12; p=0.054).Conclusions Genetic and non-genetic analyses provide consistent evidence for an association between CRP and negative affect. Genetic analyses suggest that IL-6 signaling could be relevant for memory, and that the association between CRP and anxiety disorders could be causal. These results suggest that dysregulated immune physiology may impact a broad range of trans-diagnostic affective symptoms. However, given the small effect sizes and multiple tests conducted, future studies are required to investigate whether effects are moderated by sub-groups and whether these findings replicate in other cohorts."

The first, major neurocognitive psychosis (MNP) was characterized by cognitive deficits in executive functions and memory, higher prevalence of psychomotor retardation, formal thought disorders, mannerisms, psychosis, hostility, excitation, and negative symptoms, and diverse neuroimmune aberrations. Simple neurocognitive psychosis (SNP) was the less severe phenotype.Aims The study comprised a sample of 40 healthy controls and 90 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, divided into MNP and SNP based on previously determined criteria. Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) was performed using neurocognitive test results and measurements of serum M1 macrophage cytokines, IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-23 as discriminatory/modelling variables. The model-to-model distances between controls and MNP+SNP and between MNP and SNP were computed, and the top discriminatory variables were established.Results A notable SIMCA distance of 146.1682 was observed between MNP+SNP and the control group; the top-3 discriminatory variables were lowered motor speed, an activated T helper-17 axis, and lowered working memory. This study successfully differentiated MNP from SNP yielding a SIMCA distance of 19.3. M1 macrophage activation, lowered verbal fluency, and executive functions were the prominent features of MNP versus SNP.Discussion Based on neurocognitive assessments and the immune-linked neurotoxic IL-6/IL-23/Th-17 axis, we found that MNP and SNP are qualitatively distinct classes. Future biomarker research should always examine biomarkers in the MNP versus SNP phenotypes, rather than in the combined MNP + SNP or schizophrenia group."

In this project, we propose to use Enhance IVR, a gamified cognitive training that can be tailored to specific ER strategies that individuals may face, such as difficulty with attention control, inhibition, or cognitive flexibility.Methods and analysis This is a longitudinal, parallel, single-blind, randomized, controlled pilot trial with an estimated sample of 160 participants. The first group (experimental group) will receive the gamified IVR program (Enhance IVR), while the second group (active control group) will receive a comparable IVR relaxation experience. Both Enhance IVR and the control IVR interventions will last five weeks, two times a week, 30 minutes (10 sessions per participant). Participants will undergo a baseline assessment that includes several measures related to mental health, ER, executive functioning, and cognitive performance, and another post intervention assessment with the same measures. Finally, variables related to system usability and cybersickness with the IVR tool will be evaluated for both groups.Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the International University of Catalonia (PSI-2023-04). The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, reports, conferences, and other scientific events.Strengths and limitations of this studyThis is a controlled, randomized, and single-blind design, which provides rigorous evidence for a virtual reality (VR) intervention effect.The intervention has a strong ecological validity as it is done in the participants’ natural context (i.e. school) and the assessment involves students, family, and school.The gamified VR design is innovative and engaging, and there is an equivalent active-based VR control condition.One limitation is there is no follow-up assessment and no double-blind experimental design due to the nature of the study.A second limitation is the potential drop-out rates due the preventive nature of the interventions."

Zimbabwe has been implementing both targeted testing and the status-neutral concept. In this paper, we analyse the role of status-neutral concepts in targeted testing, for effective case identification and linkage to prevention and treatment services.Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study on 36 multi-stage sampled sites across 4/10 provinces of Zimbabwe. Screened and non-screened patients were tested and analysed for positivity ratios and linkage to post-test services. Data were extracted using Epicollect5 and imported into EpiData software and Stata for cleaning and analysis. Data were summarized as proportions, odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios at 5% significance level.Results Of 23,058 HIV tests done, females constituted 55% (n=12,698), whilst 63.5% (n=14,650) were retests and positivity of 7.5% obtained. Screened patients contributed 75.1% to the overall positivity (1,296/1,727), from 66% (n=15,289) of the total tests conducted. The 45–49-year category was 3.6 times more likely to test positive (a95%CI:2.67,4.90). Males were 3.09 times more likely to test positive in adjusted analysis (a95%CI: 2.74, 3.49), from an 8% (n=912) positivity ratio. First tests were 65% more likely to test HIV positive (a95%CI: 1.43, 1.91) whilst screened patients were 3.89 times more likely to link to HIV prevention services (a95%CI: 3.05, 4.97), against 25.5% (n=1,871) linkage among patients not screenedConclusion Targeted and status-neutral testing are related and complimentary concepts which, when simultaneously applied, potentiates case identification through prioritizing high-risk individuals for testing, as well as arresting ongoing transmission of HIV through effective linkage to HIV prevention and treatment. This approach facilitates economic usage of limited resources, in generalized epidemics."

In order to further increase the throughput and accuracy of these approaches, mathematicians regularly devise novel combinatorial methods. However, although these novel methods are easily validated in silico, they are often never implemented in diagnostic laboratories because of the lack of clear and standardised pathways to clinical validation.Methods We develop a standardised analytical workflow that makes use of high-throughput automation and virus-like particle standards to validate theoretical group testing approaches. We then utilise specially developed virus-like particles for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) to develop and validate a novel multiplex group testing approach based on simulated annealing and Bayesian optimization. Our approach improves the inference of positive samples in group testing, leveraging the quantitative nature of RT-qPCR test results.Results Our results show a higher positive predictive value of our novel approach for the inference of positive samples compared to the standard approach using binary test outcomes. In large-scale surveillance testing our method can greatly reduce the number of false positive identifications. Our in vitro findings show the viability of group testing for multiplexed testing of respiratory infections and demonstrate the potential of a novel inference method. Both innovations increase the number of people that can be tested with the available resources, which is particularly important in low-resource settings."

Considering the potential for nonlinear relationships and the high dimensionality of medication data, machine learning and advanced regression methods may offer advantages over traditional regression techniques. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of different modeling approaches incorporating medication data for mortality prediction.Methods This was a single-center, observational cohort study of critically ill adults. A random sample of 991 adults admitted ≥ 24 hours to the intensive care unit (ICU) from 10/2015 to 10/2020 were included. Models to predict hospital mortality at discharge were created. Models were externally validated against a temporally separate dataset of 4,878 patients. Potential mortality predictor variables (n=27, together with 14 indicators for missingness) were collected at baseline (age, sex, service, diagnosis) and 24 hours (illness severity, supportive care use, fluid balance, laboratory values, MRC-ICU score, and vasopressor use) and included in all models. The optimal traditional (equipped with linear predictors) logistic regression model and optimal advanced (equipped with nature splines, smoothing splines, and local linearity) logistic regression models were created using stepwise selection by Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Supervised, classification-based ML models [e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost] were developed. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were compared among different mortality prediction models.Results A model including MRC-ICU in addition to SOFA and APACHE II demonstrated an AUROC of 0.83 for hospital mortality prediction, compared to AUROCs of 0.72 and 0.81 for APACHE II and SOFA alone. Machine learning models based on Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost demonstrated AUROCs of 0.83, 0.85, and 0.82, respectively. Accuracy of traditional regression models was similar to that of machine learning models. MRC-ICU demonstrated a moderate level of feature importance in both XGBoost and Random Forest. Across all ten models, performance was lower on the validation set.Conclusions While medication data were not included as a significant predictor in regression models, addition of MRC-ICU to severity of illness scores (APACHE II and SOFA) improved AUROC for mortality prediction. Machine learning methods did not improve model performance relative to traditional regression methods."

Meanwhile, variations in social experiences are known to be associated with differential health outcomes. We test whether immigration history is associated with health differences among U.S.-based Cuban refugees. Cubans from the circum-1980 Mariel Boatlift migration wave reported significantly higher instances of disability than Early Cuban Exiles, Freedom Flight refugees, and Special Period refugees. We also interviewed Miami-based Cubans. Participants described heightened discrimination in 1980s Cuba and U.S., which we hypothesize contributed to higher instances of disability refugees of that era. By understanding how differential social experiences shape health, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the social determinants of health and the ways adverse experiences can be combated.One-Sentence Summary Even within a Latiné community from a single country of origin, we find that differential social experiences of immigrating to the U.S. are associated with variation in health outcomes."

This issue is commonly encountered in small datasets (colloquially known as “small n, large p” datasets or high-dimensional data). It was recently reported based on analysis of data from five placebo-controlled trials that clinical prediction models in schizophrenia showed poor performance (average balanced accuracy, BAC, 0.54). This was interpreted to suggest that prediction models in schizophrenia have poor generalizability. In this paper we demonstrate that this outcome more likely reflects the peaking phenomenon in a small n, large p dataset (n=1513 participants, p=217) and generalize this to a set of illustrative cases using simulated data. We then demonstrate that an ensemble of supervised learning models trained using more data (18 placebo-controlled trials, n=4634 participants), but fewer predictors (p=33), achieves better prediction (average BAC = 0.64) which generalizes to out-of-sample studies as well as to data from active-controlled trials (n=1463, average BAC = 0.67). Based on these findings, we argue that the achievable prediction accuracy for treatment response in schizophrenia— and likely for many other medical conditions—is highly dependent on sample size and the number of included predictors, and, hence, remains unknown until more data has been analyzed. Finally, we provide recommendations for how researchers and data holders might work to improve future data analysis efforts in clinical prediction."

A total of 249 metabolites were measured with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. LASSO regression with bootstrapping was used to identify metabolites in sex-specific analyses and the predictive performance of metabolites added to the SCORE2-Diabetes model was primarily evaluated with Harrell’s C-index.Results Seven metabolomic biomarkers were selected by LASSO regression for enhanced MACE risk prediction (three for both sexes, three male- and one female-specific metabolite(s)). Especially albumin and the omega-3-fatty-acids-to-total-fatty-acids-percentage among males and lactate among females improved the C-index. In internal validation with 30% of the UKB, adding the selected metabolites to the SCORE2-Diabetes model increased the C-index statistically significantly (P=0.034) from 0.660 to 0.680 in the total sample. In external validation with ESTHER, the C-index increase was higher (+0.041) and remained statistically significant (P=0.015).Conclusions Incorporating seven metabolomic biomarkers in the SCORE2-Diabetes model enhanced its ability to predict MACE in patients with type 2 diabetes. Given the latest cost reduction and standardization efforts, NMR metabolomics has the potential for translation into the clinical routine."

The presence of mLOY is associated with altered blood cell counts and increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, solid tumors, and other age-related diseases. We sought to gain a better understanding of genetic drivers and associated phenotypes of mLOY through analyses of whole genome sequencing of a large set of genetically diverse males from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. This approach enabled us to identify differences in mLOY frequencies across populations defined by genetic similarity, revealing a higher frequency of mLOY in the European American (EA) ancestry group compared to those of Hispanic American (HA), African American (AA), and East Asian (EAS) ancestry. Further, we identified two genes (CFHR1 and LRP6) that harbor multiple rare, putatively deleterious variants associated with mLOY susceptibility, show that subsets of human hematopoietic stem cells are enriched for activity of mLOY susceptibility variants, and that certain alleles on chromosome Y are more likely to be lost than others."

In this genetic and proteomic study, we expand the number of genetic loci from 19 to 29, and identify 31 associated plasma proteins. Many risk-increasing loci were associated with later age at menopause, underscoring the reproductive longevity related to a larger functional ovarian reserve. Hormonal regulation in the aetiology of this condition, through metabolic and reproductive features, was emphasised. The proteomic analysis highlighted perturbations of metabolically-related biology that are typical in women with PCOS. A PCOS polygenic risk score was associated with adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes, with differing contributions of testosterone and BMI in women and men. Finally, while oligo- and anovulatory infertility are characteristic features of PCOS, we observed no impact of PCOS susceptibility on childlessness. We suggest that PCOS susceptibility confers balanced pleiotropic influences on fertility in women, and life-long adverse metabolic consequences in both sexes."

Phecodes, billing code-derived disease case-control status, are usually used as outcome variables in PheWAS and logistic regression has been the standard choice of analysis method. Since the clinical diagnoses in EMR are often inaccurate with errors which can lead to biases in the odds ratio estimates, much effort has been put to accurately define the cases and controls to ensure an accurate analysis. Specifically in order to correctly classify controls in the population, an exclusion criteria list for each Phecode was manually compiled to obtain unbiased odds ratios. However, the accuracy of the list cannot be guaranteed without extensive data curation process. The costly curation process limits the efficiency of large-scale analyses that take full advantage of all structured phenotypic information available in EMR. Here, we proposed to estimate relative risks (RR) instead. We first demonstrated the desired nature of RR that overcomes the inaccuracy in the controls via theoretical formula. With simulation and real data application, we further confirmed that RR is unbiased without compiling exclusion criteria lists. With RR as estimates, we are able to efficiently extend PheWAS to a larger-scale, phenome construction agnostic analysis of phenotypes, using ICD 9/10 codes, which preserve much more disease-related clinical information than Phecodes."

It necessitated design, development, and deployment of a nationwide infrastructure designed for sequestration, consolidation, and characterization of patient samples that disseminates de-identified information to public authorities in tight turnaround times. Here, we describe our development of such an infrastructure, which sequenced 594,832 high coverage SARS-CoV-2 genomes from isolates we collected in the U.S. from March 13th 2020 to July 3rd 2023. Our sequencing protocol (‘Virseq’) generates mutation-resistant sequencing of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, capturing all major lineages. We also characterize 379 clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 multi-strain co-infections and ensure robust detection of emerging lineages via simulation. The modular infrastructure, sequencing, and analysis capabilities we describe support the U.S. Centers for Disease Control national surveillance program and serve as a model for rapid response to emerging pandemics at a national scale."

This study synthesizes evidence on disruptions to primary care, focusing on hypertension and diabetes care and mitigation approaches taken during the pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).Methods We conducted a scoping review, searching nine electronic databases for studies from January 2020 to December 2022 on COVID-19-related primary care disruptions and interventions, including studies on hospital-based interventions given their relevance to the pandemic response in LAC. We adapted the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative framework to develop our search strategy and synthesize data. For studies reporting interventions, we included studies conducted outside of LAC.Findings Of 33,510 references screened, 388 studies were included (259 reported disruptions in LAC, 61 interventions in LAC, 63 interventions outside LAC, and five interventions from countries within and outside LAC), with three-quarters presenting data from Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Peru; few studies focused on rural areas. Additionally, the few studies that adequately quantified care disruptions reported a reduction in hypertension and diabetes control during the pandemic (e.g., hypertension control rate decreased from 68% to 55% in Mexico). Frequently reported causes of disruption included burnout and mental health challenges among healthcare workers (with disproportionate effects by type of worker), reduced medication supplies, and reduced frequency of clinic visits by patients (e.g., due to financial constraints). The most reported interventions included remote care strategies (e.g., smartphone applications, virtual meeting platforms) and mental health programs for healthcare workers. Remote care strategies were deemed feasible for care delivery, triaging, and clinical support for non-physicians. Patients were generally satisfied with telemedicine, whereas providers had mixed perceptions. Robust evidence on the effectiveness of remote care strategies for diabetes and hypertension care was unavailable in LAC.Interpretation Hypertension and diabetes control appeared to worsen in LAC during the pandemic. Major reported causes of care disruptions were workforce issues, reduced medication supply, and changes in patient perceptions of seeking and receiving primary healthcare. Remote care strategies were feasible for various purposes and were well received by patients. However, the lack of data on intervention effectiveness underscores the importance of strengthening research capacity to generate robust evidence during future pandemics. Developing resilient healthcare systems able to provide care for hypertension and diabetes during future pandemics will depend on investment in the healthcare workforce, medical supply chain, health data and research infrastructure, and technology readiness.Funding This work was supported by funding from the World Bank to Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences.

The best way to screen for colorectal cancer (CRC) is with a colonoscopy, which has been shown to lower the risk of the disease. As a result, Computer-aided polyp classification technique is applied to identify colorectal cancer. But visually categorizing polyps is difficult since different polyps have different lighting conditions.Different from previous works, this article presents Enhanced Scattering Wavelet Convolutional Neural Network (ESWCNN), a polyp classification technique that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Scattering Wavelet Transform (SWT) to improve polyp classification performance. This method concatenates simultaneously learnable image filters and wavelet filters on each input channel. The scattering wavelet filters can extract common spectral features with various scales and orientations, while the learnable filters can capture image spatial features that wavelet filters may miss.A network architecture for ESWCNN is designed based on these principles and trained and tested using colonoscopy datasets (two public datasets and one private dataset). An n-fold cross-validation experiment was conducted for three classes (adenoma, hyperplastic, serrated) achieving a classification accuracy of 96.4%, and 94.8% accuracy in two-class polyp classification (positive and negative). In the three-class classification, correct classification rates of 96.2% for adenomas, 98.71% for hyperplastic polyps, and 97.9% for serrated polyps were achieved. The proposed method in the two-class experiment reached an average sensitivity of 96.7% with 93.1% specificity.Furthermore, we compare the performance of our model with the state-of-the-art general classification models and commonly used CNNs. Six end-to-end models based on CNNs were trained using 2 dataset of video sequences. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ESWCNN method can effectively classify polyps with higher accuracy and efficacy compared to the state-of-the-art CNN models. These findings can provide guidance for future research in polyp classification."

However, their use raises ethical concerns due to the potential for inaccurate medical advice that could harm patients. Previous studies in dermatological machine-learning have highlighted that the underrepresentation of diverse skin types in research could lead to bias and reduced performance in evaluating skin lesions in darker skin tones. This study aims to assess the accuracy of GPT-4 in generating appropriate differential diagnoses and arriving at the correct diagnoses for common skin lesions. Additionally, we investigate any differences in its diagnostic accuracy between darker and lighter skin tones.Method Fifty images were randomly selected from the Fitzpatrick 17k dataset, a publicly available online collection of clinical images labelled with the appropriate diagnoses and skin types based on the Fitzpatrick scoring system. Half of the images selected represented darker skin tones, Fitzpatrick IV-VI, and the other half represented lighter skin tones, Fitzpatrick I-II. For each selected dermatological condition, GPT-4 was presented with pairs of images - one from a lighter skin tone and another from a darker skin tone. GPT-4 was then asked to provide its top three differential diagnoses and a final diagnosis for each pair. The responses generated by GPT-4 were transcribed and compared against the labels provided in the dataset to evaluate accuracy. Subsequently, a univariate linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between Fitzpatrick skin type and diagnostic accuracy of GPT-4.Results Out of the 50 selected images, the distribution of Fitzpatrick skin types was as follows: 40% were Fitzpatrick type I, 10% were type II, 4% were type IV, 26% were type V, and 20% were type VI. Overall, GPT-4 correctly diagnosed the condition in 28% of the images (n=14/50), while the correct diagnosis was included in its list of top differentials for 48% of the images (n=24/50). GPT-4 exhibited better performance in providing the correct diagnosis for lighter skin tones (44%, n=11/25) compared to darker skin tones (12%, n=3/25), and this was statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). Furthermore, with each unit increase in the Fitzpatrick scale, GPT-4s performance decreased by 11.4% in accurately providing a differential diagnosis and by 7.1% in accurately providing the correct diagnosis.Conclusion GPT-4 exhibited significantly lower overall accuracy compared to previous studies reporting accuracies as high as 90%. This discrepancy highlights GPT-4s potential limitations in providing accurate information without sufficient clinical context. While GPT-4 could serve as a valuable learning tool for medical students and dermatology residents, it may not be suitable for patients seeking clinical input to self-diagnose lesions at home. It is important to note that this study is limited by its relatively small sample size, which could impact the generalizability of the findings. If GPT-4 is to be considered for use by patients in a clinical setting, it is important to ensure that it demonstrates high accuracy and remains unbiased across all patient demographics and skin types."

A mixed methods study of community-led HIV self-testing programmes in rural Zimbabwe","ABSTRACTCommunity-led interventions, where communities plan and lead implementation, are increasingly adopted in public health. We explore what factors may be associated with successful community-led distribution of HIV self-test (HIVST) kits to guide future service delivery.Twenty rural communities were supported to implement month-long HIVST kit distribution programmes from January-September/2019. Participant observation was conducted to document distribution models. Three months post-intervention, a population-based survey measured: self-reported new HIV diagnosis; self-reported HIVST uptake; self-reported linkage to post-test services; and viral load. The survey included questions for a composite measure of ‗community cohesion‘. Communities were grouped into low/medium/high based on community cohesion scores. We used mixed effect logistic regression to assess how outcomes differed by community cohesion. In total, 27,812 kits were distributed by 348 distributors. Two kit distribution models were implemented: door-to-door distribution only or distribution at venues/events within communities. Of 5,683 participants surveyed, 1,831 (32.2%) received kits and 1,229 (67.1%) reported using it; overall HIVST uptake was 1,229/5,683 (21.6%). Self-reported new HIV diagnosis increased with community cohesion, from 32/1,770 (1.8%) in the lowest cohesion group to 40/1,871 (2.1%) in the medium group, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.94 (1.41-6.12, p=0.004) and 66/2,042 (3.2%) in the highest cohesion group, aOR 7.20 (2.31-22.50, p=0.001). Other outcomes did not differ by extent of cohesion.HIVST kit distribution in high-cohesion communities was associated with seven times higher odds of identifying people with new HIV diagnoses, suggesting more cohesive communities may better identify those most at risk of undiagnosed HIV. Communities can learn from and adopt these participatory community-led approaches to intervention planning and implementation, which may foster cohesion and benefit public health programmes."

They are also at risk for psychological problems, including anxiety, depression, and inattention. The current study examines associations between exercise capacity and psychological functioning in a clinical sample of pediatric patients with FC.Methods A multidisciplinary team evaluated participants in a dedicated clinic for pediatric patients with FC. Patients completed cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); metrics selected for analyses included peak oxygen consumption (VO2), maximum achieved heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation at peak exercise, ventilatory anaerobic threshold, work rate, respiratory exchange ratio, and HR recovery at 1-, 3-, and 8-minutes after exercise. Parent and child were administered a standardized questionnaire to measure depression, anxiety, and inattention symptoms. Patients who completed CPET with adequate effort and a psychological measure were eligible for inclusion. Clinical data were extracted from medical records and analyzed using Pearson correlations.Results Clinical sample (n = 51) was 55% male with a mean age of 13.6 years (SD=2.5). A majority had hypoplastic left heart syndrome (51%). There was a significant negative correlation between parent-report of inattention and peak VO2 (R= -.307, 95% CI -.549/-.018, P= 0.038). Self-report of anxiety was positively correlated with HR recovery at 3 (R= .438, 95% CI .155/.655, P= 0.004) and 8 (R= .432, 95% CI .147/.651, P= 0.004) minutes post exercise. Depression was positively correlated with HR recovery at 3 minutes for parent report (R= .294, 95% CI .004/.538, P= 0.047) and 8 minutes for self-report (R= .410, 95% CI .122/.635, P= 0.007).Conclusions Inattention, depression, and anxiety symptoms were correlated with some CPET metrics in our clinical sample of pediatric patients with FC. Greater inattention symptoms were associated with lower peak VO2. Those with greater depression and anxiety symptoms showed a more rapid decline from max HR to recovery period.What is KnownMany patients with Fontan circulation (FC) have some degree of diminished exercise capacity.The risk for mental health problems in pediatric patients with FC is very high, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 65%.What the Study AddsThere may be a link between mental health symptoms and exercise capacity metrics obtained during CPET for children and adolescents with FC.Our study found that greater inattention symptoms were linked to lower observed peak VO2 during CPET.Participants with higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms exhibited a more dramatic decline in HR after exercise, contrary to findings in other cardiac patient samples that report an attenuated HR response for those with depression and anxiety."

By providing immediate positive feedback when tics are suppressed, games can counteract negative reinforcement processes that reinforce tics, which assumingly alleviates unpleasant premonitory urges. We developed a gamified protocol (XTics), which leverages this potential by combining gamified tic triggers with immediate reinforcement of tic suppression. We evaluate the clinical value of immediate reward contingency in enhancing tic suppression performance.Methods XTics comprises two conditions: tic-contingent and non-contingent. In the tic-contingent version, game progression was determined by real-time input from an experimenter who monitored the participant’s tics, rewarding tic suppression with favorable outcomes. Conversely, in the non-contingent version, game events occurred randomly. Using a crossover design, we trained 35 participants (aged 7-15) in both versions, with each participant undergoing a preliminary behavioral training and three hourly sessions for each condition. We both evaluated the overall protocol’s four-week impact on tic severity measures and compared contingent and non-contingent conditions.Results We achieved complete adherence to the protocol, while the participants increased their tic-free intervals by an average of 558% from the first to the last training day. YGTSS, a clinical measure of tic severity, showed an average clinically meaningful reduction of 25.69±23.39%, which was larger than that observed in control interventions and comparable to the effects of longer non-pharmacological treatments. Parent-reported tic severity decreased by 42.99±31.69% from baseline to three months post-treatment. When contrasting the tic-contingent with the tic-non-contingent training versions, we observed a larger improvement in tic-free interval duration in the former case (t(67)=3.15, p=.0025). Additionally, Rush, another measure of tic severity, demonstrated a greater reduction following training with the contingent compared to the non-contingent version (t(47)=3.47, p=.002).Conclusion The combination of gamified tic triggering with immediate and contingent rewards demonstrates a promising approach for enhancing treatment efficacy in TDs, offering an engaging boost to traditional therapeutic methods."

However, how metabolites relate to the adiposity-EC relationship remains unclear.Methods We have brought together evidence from Mendelian randomization (MR) and observational analyses to evaluate the effect of i) adiposity traits on endometrial cancer, ii) adiposity traits on circulating metabolites and iii) adiposity-associated metabolites on EC. We have also evaluated the potential role of metabolites in the adiposity-EC relationship using multivariable MR. Observational analyses were conducted using individual level data from UK Biobank (N = 1,005 cases and 215,339 controls). MR analyses were performed using female-specific summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of body mass index (BMI; N up to 434,794), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; N up to 381,152), 249 metabolites and ratios from targeted nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics (N up to 140,768) and EC risk (12,906 cases and 108,979 controls).Results In observational analyses, higher BMI and WHR were associated with elevated odds of overall EC (odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) increase in BMI = 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19, 1.57; OR per SD increase in WHR= 1.15; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.32). In MR analysis, higher BMI was associated with elevated odds of overall EC risk (OR per SD increase in BMI = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.56, 2.07), endometrioid cancer (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.45, 2.02) and non-endometrioid cancer (OR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.55, 3.12). There was weaker evidence for a causal relationship with WHR. BMI was associated with 165 metabolites and ratios after Bonferroni-correction in MR analyses, several of which were associated with EC and 25 of which were directionally consistent with an intermediate role in the effect of BMI on EC risk from two-step MR and observational analyses. In MVMR analyses, there was evidence suggesting that the effect of BMI on non-endometrioid EC was mediated by several lipid metabolites; for example, the univariable MR OR for non-endometrioid EC per 1 SD increase in BMI was 2.51 (95%CI = 1.47, 4.29), whereas on adjusting for free cholesterol to total lipids ratio in medium LDL, the MVMR OR for non-endometrioid EC per 1 SD increase in BMI was 1.18 (95%CI = 0.53, 2.66). Further bioinformatic analyses highlighted a mixture of other potential shared pathways (including height, adiposity traits and blood cell traits) that could influence the risk of EC.Conclusion Evidence here suggests that higher BMI causes a higher risk of overall and all histological subtypes of EC and variation in numerous circulating metabolites. Several of these metabolites showed relationships consistent with an intermediate role between BMI and non-endometrioid EC, however, further bioinformatic analyses highlighted other potential shared mechanisms that could influence the risk of EC."

A Comparative Study on Large Language Model Understanding of Emergency Medical Scenarios in Resource-Constrained Settings,"AbstractThe capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced since their popularization a few years ago. The healthcare sector operates on, and generates a large volume of data annually and thus, there is a growing focus on the applications of LLMs within this sector. There are a few medicine-oriented evaluation datasets and benchmarks for assessing the performance of various LLMs in clinical scenarios; however, there is a paucity of information on the real-world usefulness of LLMs in context-specific scenarios in resourceconstrained settings. In this study, 16 iterations of a decision support tool for medical emergencies using 4 distinct generalized LLMs were constructed, alongside a combination of 4 Prompt Engineering techniques: In-Context Learning with 5-shot prompting (5SP), chain-of-thought prompting (CoT), self-questioning prompting (SQP), and a stacking of self-questioning prompting and chain-of-thought (SQCT). In total 428 model responses were quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated by 22 clinicians familiar with the medical scenarios and background contexts. Our study highlights the benefits of In-Context Learning with few-shot prompting, and the utility of the relatively novel self-questioning prompting technique. We also demonstrate the benefits of combining various prompting techniques to elicit the best performance of LLMs in providing contextually applicable health information. We also highlight the need for continuous human expert verification in the development and deployment of LLM-based health applications, especially in use cases where context is paramount."

Many of these models have been operationalized into malaria early warning systems (MEWSs), which provide predictions of malaria dynamics several months in advance at national and regional levels. However, MEWSs do not generally produce predictions at the village-level, the operational scale of community health systems and the first point of contact for the majority of rural populations in malaria-endemic countries.Methods We developed a hyper-local MEWS for use within a health-system strengthening intervention in rural Madagascar. It combined bias-corrected, village-level case notification data with remotely sensed environmental variables at spatial scales as fine as a 10m resolution. A spatio-temporal hierarchical generalized linear regression model was trained on monthly malaria case data from 195 communities from 2017-2020 and evaluated via cross- validation. The model was then integrated into an automated workflow with environmental data updated monthly to create a continuously updating MEWS capable of predicting malaria cases up to three months in advance at the village-level. Predictions were transformed into indicators relevant to health system actors by estimating the quantities of medical supplies required at each health clinic and the number of cases remaining untreated at the community level.Results The statistical model was able to accurately reproduce village-level case data, performing nearly five times as well as a null model during cross-validation. The dynamic environmental variables, particularly those associated with standing water and rice field dynamics, were strongly associated with malaria incidence, allowing the model to accurately predict future incidence rates. When compared to historical stock data, the MEWS predicted stock requirements within 50 units of reported stock requirements 68% of the time.Conclusion We demonstrate the feasibility of developing an automatic, hyper-local MEWS leveraging remotely-sensed environmental data at fine spatial scales. As health system data become increasingly digitized, this method can be easily applied to other regions and be updated with near real-time health data to further increase performance."

While several qualitative studies have investigated this issue, there has been no effort to synthesize this literature.Purpose This study aimed to utilize qualitative thematic synthesis to employ an intersectionality framework in synthesizing existing published qualitative studies on barriers to and facilitators of physical activity for Black women and reflect constructs related to (a) all American women, (b) Black Americans, and (c) Black women. This qualitative thematic synthesis included 18 studies published from 2011 to the present. Studies were coded for quality and then reviewed with their themes identified and inductively integrated across the studies. The resulting themes were then deductively placed within a broader structure of an intersectionality framework. Reflecting this framework, three categories were identified: (1) general experience of physical activity for women, regardless of race, with themes of (a) motivation, (b) structured support, (c) overall health, (d) environment; (2) general experiences of physical activity for Black Americans, with a sub-theme of (a) low access; and (3) specific, intersectional experiences of physical activity for Black women, with sub-themes of (a) black hair, and (b) body ideal. Our synthesis of the existing qualitative research revealed that Black women experience PA related to being a woman, to being Black, and to the intersectional nature of being a Black woman. Interventions might target these intersectional themes to tailor interventions to support PA in Black women."

Recent studies suggest that ketogenic diet may be therapeutically effective for subgroups of people with schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BPD) and possibly major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite this promise, there is currently limited information regarding brain energy metabolism pathways across these disorders, limiting our understanding of how brain metabolic pathways are altered and who may benefit from ketogenic diets. We conducted gene expression profiling on the amygdala, a key region involved in in the regulation of mood and appetitive behaviors, to test the hypothesis that amygdala metabolic pathways are differentially altered between these disorders.Study Design We used a cohort of subjects diagnosed with SCZ, BPD or MDD, and non-psychiatrically ill control subjects (n=15/group), together with our bioinformatic 3-pod analysis consisting of full transcriptome pathway analysis, targeted pathway analysis, leading-edge gene analysis and iLINCS perturbagen analysis.Study Results We identified differential expression of metabolic pathways in each disorder. Subjects with SCZ displayed downregulation of mitochondrial respiration and nucleotide metabolism pathways. In comparison, we observed upregulation of mitochondrial respiration pathways in subjects with MDD, while subjects with BPD displayed enrichment of pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Several pathways associated with brain metabolism including immune system processes and calcium ion transport were also differentially altered between diagnosis groups.Conclusion Our findings suggest metabolic pathways are differentially altered in the amygdala in these disorders, which may impact approaches for therapeutic strategies."

Using existing concentration-response functions, particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution, population estimates at the tract level, and county-level mortality data, we estimated the degree to which these mortality discrepancies can be attributed to differences in exposure and susceptibility to PM2.5. We show that differences in mortality attributable to PM2.5 were consistently more pronounced between racial/ethnic groups than by education, rurality, or social vulnerability index, with the Black American population having by far the highest proportion of deaths attributable to PM2.5 in all years from 1990 to 2016. Over half of the difference in age-adjusted all-cause mortality between the Black American and non-Hispanic White population was attributable to PM2.5 in the years 2000 to 2011."

Simulations used a SEIIS spreadsheet model that ran two parallel subpopulations: one that accepted vaccination, and another that refused it. The two subpopulations could transmit infections to one another. Using data from the United States (US), the simulated vaccine was tested against limiting factors such as vaccine hesitancy, slow vaccination distribution, and the development of high-transmission variants. The vaccine was often successful at reducing cases, but high-transmission variants and discontinuation of non-pharaceutical interventsions (NPIs) such as masking greatly elevated cases. A puzzling outcome was that if NPIs are discontinued and high-transmission variants become common, the model predicted consistently higher rates of disease than are actually observed in the US in 2024. However, if cumulative exposure to virus antigens increases the duration of immunity or decreases the infectivity of the virus, the model predictions were brought back into a more realistic range. The major finding was that even when a COVID vaccine always produces sterilizing immunity against every SARS-CoV-2 variant, its ability to control the epidemic can be compromised by multiple common conditions."

However, the increase in infections was not accompanied by increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and mortality commensurate with prior waves. To understand shifts in COVID-19 epidemiology associated with JN.1 emergence, we compared characteristics and clinical outcomes of time-matched cases infected with BA.2.86- derived lineages (predominantly representing JN.1) versus co-circulating XBB-derived lineages in December, 2023 and January, 2024. Cases infected with BA.2.86-derived lineages received greater numbers of COVID-19 vaccine doses, including XBB.1.5-targeted and BA.4/BA.5-targeted boosters, in comparison to cases infected with XBB-derived lineages. Additionally, cases infected with BA.2.86-derived lineages experienced greater numbers of documented prior SARS-CoV-2 infections. These associations of BA.2.86-derived lineages with immune escape were confirmed when comparing cases diagnosed during periods when JN.1 was the predominant circulating lineage to cases diagnosed during November, 2023. Cases infected with BA.2.86-derived lineages, or during periods when JN.1 was the predominant circulating lineage, also experienced lower risk of progression to severe clinical outcomes requiring emergency department consultations or hospital admission. Sensitivity analyses suggested under-ascertainment of prior infections, even if differential between cases infected with BA.2.86-derived lineages and non-BA.2.86 lineages, could not explain this apparent attenuation of severity. Our findings implicate escape from immunity acquired from prior vaccination or infection in the emergence of the JN.1 lineage and suggest infections with this lineage are less likely to experience clinically-severe disease. Monitoring of immune escape and clinical severity in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants remains a priority to inform responses."

Our aim was therefore to develop and implement an ACD resource for Black people who have previously been involuntarily hospitalised and the people that support them.Methods Resource co-production workshops were held to inform the development of the ACD template and two types of training for all stakeholders, comprising a Recovery College course and simulation training. An ACD facilitator developed ACDs with service users and mental health staff over a series of meetings. Interviews with service user and staff participants were conducted after ACD completion and analysed to document their experience of the process and opinions on ACDs. Other implementation strategies were also employed alongside to support and optimise the development of ACDs.Results Nine ACDs were completed and were largely reported as appropriate, acceptable, and feasible to staff and service users. Both reported it being an empowering process that encouraged hope for better future treatment and therefore better wellbeing. Uncertainty was also expressed about the confidence people had that ACDs would be adhered to/honoured, primarily due to staff workload. The information provision training and the skills training were generally considered to be informative by attendees.Conclusions The project has developed an ACD development resource that was reported as agreeable to all stakeholders; however, the generalisability of the findings is limited due to the small sample size. The project also highlights the importance of staff and ACD facilitator capacity and good therapeutic relationships in ACD completion. Further research is needed to determine the adjustments needed for large scale use, including for those under age 18 and those under the care of forensic mental health services; and how to include carers/supporters more in the process."

Despite accumulating evidence on the clinical prognostic value of tau PET in typical late-onset amnestic AD, its utility in predicting clinical decline in individuals with atypical forms of AD remains unclear. In this study, we examined the relationship between baseline tau PET signal and the rate of subsequent clinical decline in a sample of 48 A+/T+/N+ patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD with atypical clinical phenotypes (Posterior Cortical Atrophy, logopenic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia, and amnestic syndrome with multi-domain impairment and age of onset < 65 years). All patients underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tau (18F-Flortaucipir) PET, and amyloid (either 18F-Florbetaben or 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B) PET scans at baseline. Each patient’s longitudinal clinical decline was assessed by calculating the annualized change in the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) scores from baseline to follow-up (mean time interval = 14.55 ± 3.97 months). Our sample of early atypical AD patients showed an increase in CDR-SB by 1.18 ± 1.25 points per year: t(47) = 6.56, p < .001, d = 0.95. These AD patients showed prominent baseline tau burden in posterior cortical regions including the major nodes of the default mode network, including the angular gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and lateral temporal cortex. Greater baseline tau in the broader default mode network predicted faster clinical decline. Tau in the default mode network was the strongest predictor of clinical decline, outperforming baseline clinical impairment, tau in other functional networks, and the magnitude of cortical atrophy and amyloid burden in the default mode network. Overall, these findings point to the contribution of baseline tau burden within the default mode network of the cerebral cortex to predicting the magnitude of clinical decline in a sample of atypical early AD patients one year later. This simple measure based on a tau PET scan could aid the development of a personalized prognostic, monitoring, and treatment plan tailored to each individual patient, which would help clinicians not only predict the natural evolution of the disease but also estimate the effect of disease-modifying therapies on slowing subsequent clinical decline given the patient’s tau burden while still early in the disease course."

We studied the aggregation of 50 parental AIDs with T1D in offspring and the contribution of a shared genetic background, which was partitioned into HLA and non-HLA variation. Leveraging nationwide registers of 7.2M Finns, including 58,284 family trios, we observed that 15 parental AIDs, such as coeliac disease and rheumatoid arthritis, were associated with an increased risk of T1D in offspring. The identified epidemiological associations were then tested by comprehensive genetic analyses performed on 470K Finns genotyped in the FinnGen study (12,563 trios). The within-family genetic transmission analysis further demonstrated that the aggregation of parental AIDs with offspring T1D could be partially explained by HLA and non-HLA polymorphisms in a disease-dependent manner. For example, the associations with offspring T1D for coeliac disease and psoriasis were mainly driven by HLA while autoimmune hypothyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis also had non-HLA contributors. We, therefore, proposed a novel parental polygenic score (PGS), integrating variations in both HLA and non-HLA genes, to understand the cumulative risk pattern of T1D in offspring. This raises an intriguing possibility of considering parental PGS, in conjunction with clinical diagnoses, to inform individuals about T1D risk in their offspring."

Reliable, continuous methods are needed.Objective We hypothesized that our computer vision method to track movement, pose AI, could predict neurologic changes.Design Retrospective observational study from 2021–2022.Setting A level four urban neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).Participants Infants with corrected age ≤1 year, comprising 115 patients with 4,705 hours of video data linked to electroencephalograms (EEG), including 46% female and 25.2% white non-Hispanic.Exposures Pose AI prediction of anatomic landmark position and an XGBoost classifier trained on one-minute variance in pose.Main outcomes and measures Outcomes were cerebral dysfunction, diagnosed from EEG readings by an epileptologist, and sedation, defined by the administration of sedative medications. Measures of algorithm performance were receiver operating characteristic-area under the curves (ROC-AUCs) on cross-validation and on two test datasets comprised of held-out infants and held-out video frames from infants used in training.Results Infant pose was accurately predicted in cross-validation, held-out frames, and held-out infants (respective ROC-AUCs 0.94, 0.83, 0.89). Median movement increased with age and, after accounting for age, was lower with sedative medications and in infants with cerebral dysfunction (all P<5−10-3, 10,000 permutations). Sedation prediction had high performance on cross-validation, held-out frames, and held-out infants (ROC-AUCs 0.90, 0.91, 0.87), as did prediction of cerebral dysfunction (ROC-AUCs 0.91, 0.90, 0.76).Conclusions and Relevance We used pose AI to predict sedation and cerebral dysfunction in 4,705 hours of video from a large, diverse cohort of infants. Pose AI may offer a scalable, minimally invasive method for neuro-telemetry in the NICU.Key PointsQuestion: Can computer vision track infant movement and use movement patterns to predict neurologic changes in critically ill infants?Findings: In this retrospective study of 115 infants less than 1 year old, we trained a computer vision algorithm to track movement from video data and predict sedation and cerebral dysfunction.Meaning: Computer vision can monitor alertness and relevant neurologic changes in critically ill infants."

The IVD test combines an ELISA test kit to quantify CA125 and BDNF concentrations in serum and a data treatment algorithm hosted in medical software processing results from the ELISA test and responses to six clinical variables. Serum samples and clinical variables extracted from psychometric questionnaires from 77 patients were collected from the Oxford Endometriosis CaRe Centre biobank (UK). Case/control classification was performed based on laparoscopy and histological verification of the excised lesions. Biomarkers serum concentrations and clinical variables were introduced to the software, which generates the qualitative diagnostic result (“positive” or “negative”). This test allowed the detection of 32% of cases with superficial endometriosis, which is an added value given the limited efficacy of existing imaging techniques. Even in the presence of various confounding medical conditions, the test maintained a specificity of 100%, supporting its suitability for use in patients with underlying medical conditions."

The Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE) was developed over 20 years ago. In a rapidly changing society, where new generations of adolescents are growing up in an increasingly digital world, it is crucial to ensure high reliability and validity of the questionnaire.Methods In this observational validation study, we used unique transgenerational questionnaire and health registry data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort, a population-based pregnancy cohort. Adolescents, aged ∼14 years, responded to the CAPE-16 (n = 18,835) and fathers to the CAPE-9 questionnaire (n = 28,793). We investigated the psychometric properties of CAPE-16 through factor analyses, measurement invariance testing across biological sex, response before/during the COVID-19 pandemic, and generations (comparison with fathers), and examined associations with later psychiatric diagnoses.Outcomes One third (33·4%) of adolescents reported lifetime psychotic experiences. We confirmed a three-factor structure (paranoia, bizarre thoughts, and hallucinations) of CAPE-16, and observed good scale reliability of the distress and frequency subscales (ω = ·86 and ·90). CAPE-16 measured psychotic experiences were invariant to biological sex and pandemic status. CAPE-9 was non-invariant across generations, with items related to understanding of the digital world (electrical influences) prone to bias. CAPE-16 sum scores were associated with a subsequent psychiatric diagnosis, particularly psychotic disorders (frequency: OR = 2·06; 97·5% CI = 1·70–2·46; distress: OR = 1·93; 97·5% CI = 1·63–2·26).Interpretation CAPE-16 showed robust psychometric properties across sex and pandemic status, and sum scores were associated with subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, particularly psychotic disorders. These findings suggest that with certain adjustments, CAPE-16 could have value as a screening tool for adolescents in the modern, digital world.Funding European Union’s Horizon 2020 Programme, Research Council of Norway, South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, NIMH, and the KG Jebsen Stiftelsen."

However, we have recently shown that weight loss induced prediabetes remission reduces relative T2D risk by 73% within the following two years. Therefore, we investigated relative T2D risk reduction in people with weight loss vs those with weight loss and prediabetes remission in an independent cohort: the randomized controlled Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).Methods Individuals who lost >7% of their body weight over the first year were included in this analysis. Of these, 416 were assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention and 64 received placebo. Remission of prediabetes was defined by normalization of fasting and 2h glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test and a normalized HbA1c according to ADA criteria. Non-remission was given when at least one of these criteria was not met. We computed Kaplan-Meier curves and compared them using log-rank tests and future T2D risk was assessed by computing the relative risk between groups.Results In DPP, 480 individuals achieved a weight loss of >7% and of these 114 additionally achieved prediabetes remission. Over the period of 6 years, those who achieved weight loss and remission had a 66% lower relative risk to develop T2D compared to those who only met the 7% weight loss goal [RR=0.34, 95% CI (0.15, 0.76)]. Similarly, weight loss responders had a lower relative future T2D risk compared to weight loss non-responders [RR=0.28, 95% CI (0.13, 0.64)]. Importantly, there was only a single T2D case in weight loss responders for up to 4 years after the intervention.Conclusions/interpretation The combination of achieving weight loss goals and prediabetes remission is most effective in reducing future T2D risk. Thus, beside weight loss goals, interventions in individuals with prediabetes should be continued until prediabetes remission is achieved and this ought to be adapted in current clinical praxis guidelines."

Symptom propagation may dramatically affect epidemiological outcomes, potentially causing clusters of severe disease. Conversely, it could result in chains of mild infection, generating widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health.Despite accumulating evidence that symptom propagation occurs for many respiratory pathogens, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we conducted a scoping literature review for 14 respiratory pathogens to ascertain the extent of evidence for symptom propagation by two mechanisms: dose-severity relationships and route-severity relationships.We identify considerable heterogeneity between pathogens in the relative importance of the two mechanisms, highlighting the importance of pathogen-specific investigations. For almost all pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, we found support for at least one of the two mechanisms. For some pathogens, including influenza, we found convincing evidence that both mechanisms contribute to symptom propagation.Furthermore, infectious disease models traditionally do not include symptom propagation. We summarise the present state of modelling advancements to address the methodological gap. We then investigate a simplified disease outbreak scenario, finding that under strong symptom propagation, quarantining mildly infected individuals can have negative epidemiological implications."

Here, we apply three statistical approaches to quantify and distinguish three different types of GxE interaction for a given trait and E variable. First, we detect locus-specific GxE interaction by testing for genetic correlation (rg) < 1 across E bins. Second, we detect genome-wide effects of the E variable on genetic variance by leveraging polygenic risk scores (PRS) to test for significant PRSxE in a regression of phenotypes on PRS, E, and PRSxE, together with differences in SNP-heritability across E bins. Third, we detect genome-wide proportional amplification of genetic and environmental effects as a function of the E variable by testing for significant PRSxE with no differences in SNP-heritability across E bins. Simulations show that these approaches achieve high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing these three GxE scenarios. We applied our framework to 33 UK Biobank traits (25 quantitative traits and 8 diseases; average N=325K) and 10 E variables spanning lifestyle, diet, and other environmental exposures. First, we identified 19 trait-E pairs with rg significantly < 1 (FDR<5%) (average rg=0.95); for example, white blood cell count had rg=0.95 (s.e. 0.01) between smokers and non-smokers. Second, we identified 28 trait-E pairs with significant PRSxE and significant SNP-heritability differences across E bins; for example, BMI had a significant PRSxE for physical activity (P=4.6e-5) with 5% larger SNP-heritability in the largest versus smallest quintiles of physical activity (P=7e-4). Third, we identified 15 trait-E pairs with significant PRSxE with no SNP-heritability differences across E bins; for example, waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI had a significant PRSxE effect for time spent watching television (P=5e-3) with no SNP-heritability differences. Across the three scenarios, 8 of the trait-E pairs involved disease traits, whose interpretation is complicated by scale effects. Analyses using biological sex as the E variable produced additional significant findings in each of the three scenarios. Overall, we infer a significant contribution of GxE and GxSex effects to complex trait and disease variance."

In this consensus workshop, we identified patient and caregiver priorities for recruitment, intervention delivery, and outcomes of a clinical trial of cilastatin to prevent nephrotoxic AKI.Methods We included adults with lived experience of AKI, chronic kidney disease, or risk factors for AKI (e.g., critical care hospitalization), and their caregivers. Using a modified nominal group technique approach, we conducted a series of hybrid in-person/virtual discussions covering 3 clinical trial topic areas: (1) consent and recruitment; (2) intervention delivery; and (3) trial outcomes. Participants voted on their top preferences in each topic area, and discussion transcripts were analyzed inductively using conventional content analysis.Results Thirteen individuals (11 patients, 2 caregivers) participated in the workshop. For consent and recruitment, participants prioritized technology enabled pre-screening and involvement of family members in the consent process. For intervention delivery, participants prioritized measures to facilitate intervention administration and return visits. For trial outcomes, participants identified kidney-related and other clinical outcomes (e.g., AKI, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular events) as top priorities. Analysis of transcripts provided insight into care team and family involvement in trial-related decisions, implications of allocation to a placebo arm, and impact of participants’ experiences of AKI and critical illness.Conclusion Findings from our workshop will directly inform development of a clinical trial protocol of cilastatin for nephrotoxic AKI prevention and can assist others in patient-centered approaches to AKI trial design."

Current approaches to evaluating LLMs make it difficult to identify the most impactful LLM application areas.Objective To summarize the current evaluation of LLMs in healthcare in terms of 5 components: evaluation data type, healthcare task, Natural Language Processing (NLP)/Natural Language Understanding (NLU) task, dimension of evaluation, and medical specialty.Data Sources A systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science was performed for studies published between 01-01-2022 and 02-19-2024.Study Selection Studies evaluating one or more LLMs in healthcare.Data Extraction and Synthesis Three independent reviewers categorized 519 studies in terms of data used in the evaluation, the healthcare tasks (the what) and the NLP/NLU tasks (the how) examined, the dimension(s) of evaluation, and the medical specialty studied.Results Only 5% of reviewed studies utilized real patient care data for LLM evaluation. The most popular healthcare tasks were assessing medical knowledge (e.g. answering medical licensing exam questions, 44.5%), followed by making diagnoses (19.5%), and educating patients (17.7%). Administrative tasks such as assigning provider billing codes (0.2%), writing prescriptions (0.2%), generating clinical referrals (0.6%) and clinical notetaking (0.8%) were less studied. For NLP/NLU tasks, the vast majority of studies examined question answering (84.2%). Other tasks such as summarization (8.9%), conversational dialogue (3.3%), and translation (3.1%) were infrequent. Almost all studies (95.4%) used accuracy as the primary dimension of evaluation; fairness, bias and toxicity (15.8%), robustness (14.8%), deployment considerations (4.6%), and calibration and uncertainty (1.2%) were infrequently measured. Finally, in terms of medical specialty area, most studies were in internal medicine (42%), surgery (11.4%) and ophthalmology (6.9%), with nuclear medicine (0.6%), physical medicine (0.4%) and medical genetics (0.2%) being the least represented.Conclusions and Relevance Existing evaluations of LLMs mostly focused on accuracy of question answering for medical exams, without consideration of real patient care data. Dimensions like fairness, bias and toxicity, robustness, and deployment considerations received limited attention. To draw meaningful conclusions and improve LLM adoption, future studies need to establish a standardized set of LLM applications and evaluation dimensions, perform evaluations using data from routine care, and broaden testing to include administrative tasks as well as multiple medical specialties.0. Key PointsQuestion: How are healthcare applications of large language models (LLMs) currently evaluated?Findings: Studies rarely used real patient care data for LLM evaluation. Administrative tasks such as generating provider billing codes and writing prescriptions were understudied. Natural Language Processing (NLP)/Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks like summarization, conversational dialogue, and translation were infrequently explored. Accuracy was the predominant dimension of evaluation, while fairness, bias and toxicity assessments were neglected. Evaluations in specialized fields, such as nuclear medicine and medical genetics were rare.Meaning: Current LLM assessments in healthcare remain shallow and fragmented. To draw concrete insights on their performance, evaluations need to use real patient care data across a broad range of healthcare and NLP/NLU tasks and medical specialties with standardized dimensions of evaluation."

This may cause reluctance to go to the clinic, inaccurate diagnosis, or inappropriate treatment for children with sore throat.Objective Determine the efficacy of using CandyCollect, a lollipop-inspired open-microfluidic pathogen collection device, to capture Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and compare user preference for CandyCollect, conventional pharyngeal swabs, or mouth swabs among children with pharyngitis and their caregivers.Design Participants of this cohort study were recruited over a 7-month period in 2022 – 2023.Setting This study was conducted at an ambulatory care clinic that serves pediatric patients in the Madison, Wisconsin, metropolitan area.Participants Study participants were diagnosed with GAS pharyngitis using a traditional pharyngeal swab via rapid antigen detection test (RADT); those testing positive were approached or reached out to about participation in the study. A total of 74 caregiver/children dyads were contacted about the study: 23 declined to participate; 21 were not eligible; and 30 willing and eligible participants were admitted into the study. A caregiver provided verbal consent and parental permission, and all children provided verbal assent. Immediately after the standard of care visit in which the throat swab was obtained, a research nurse guided participants through collecting oral samples: CandyCollect device and mouth swab (ESwabTM). CandyCollect and mouth swab samples were analyzed for GAS by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) at the University of Washington.Exposure Detection of salivary GAS using qPCR analysis of samples obtained from CandyCollect devices and mouth swabs.Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) The proportion of pediatric patients with GAS pharyngitis, as determined by a positive pharyngeal swab tested via a RADT, who were also positive using a CandyCollect and mouth swab analyzed by qPCR.Results All child participants (30/30) were positive for GAS by qPCR on both the mouth swab and CandyCollect. Caregivers ranked CandyCollect as a good sampling method overall (27/30), and all caregivers (30/30) would recommend the CandyCollect for children 5 years and older. Twenty-three of 30 children “really like” the taste and 24/30 would prefer to use the CandyCollect if a future test was needed. All caregivers (30/30) and most children (28/30) would be willing to use the CandyCollect device at home.Conclusion and relevance All participants tested positive for GAS on all three collection methods (pharyngeal swab, mouth swab, and CandyCollect). While both caregivers and children like the CandyCollect device, some caregivers would prefer a shorter collection time. Future work includes additional studies with larger cohorts presenting with pharyngitis of unknown etiology and shortening collection time, while maintaining the attractive form of the device.Trial Registration Registry name: ClinicalTrials.govClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05175196Weblink: https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05175196Question In pediatric patients with Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis, how do test results and user experience compare across three sampling methods—CandyCollect devices, mouth swabs, and pharyngeal swabs?Findings In this cohort study of 30 children, aged 5-14 years, saliva samples were collected with CandyCollect devices and mouth swabs and analyzed via qPCR. The results show CandyCollect, a pathogen collection tool preferred by children, had 100% concordance with the results from pharyngeal swabs positive with a rapid antigen detection test performed as part of their clinical care.Meaning With further development and testing, the CandyCollect device may potentially become an alternative sampling tool for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis."

Using a fully automated image processing pipeline, we extracted 17 different morphological vascular phenotypes, including median vessels diameter, diameter variability, main temporal angles, vascular density, central retinal equivalents, the number of bifurcations, and tortuosity, from over 130k fundus images of close to 72k UK Biobank subjects. We performed Genome-Wide Association Studies of these phenotypes. From this, we estimated their heritabilities, ranging between 5 and 25%, and genetic cross-phenotype correlations, which mostly mirrored the corresponding phenotypic correlations, but tended to be slightly larger. Projecting our genetic association signals onto genes and pathways revealed remarkably low overlap suggesting largely decoupled mechanisms modulating the different phenotypes. Our disease phenotype associations confirmed some previously known findings and revealed many novel connections. Notably, diameter variability, especially for the veins, seems to have new and interesting associations with diseases, including heart attack, pulmonary embolism, and age of death. Mendelian Randomization analysis suggests a causal influence of blood pressure and body mass index on retinal vessel morphology, among other results. We validated key findings in two independent smaller cohorts. Our analyses provide evidence that large-scale analysis of image-derived vascular phenotypes has sufficient power for obtaining functional, as well as some initial causal insights into the processes modulating the retinal vasculature."

We describe prescribing volumes and patient characteristics over time, by medication, and by FDA-labeled use. Among the subset of patients for whom post-prescription dispensing data are available, we describe the proportion and characteristics of patients who were and were not dispensed a GLP-1 RA following their prescription.Results 1,055,900 patients were prescribed a GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and March 2024, with 4,161,731 total prescriptions during this period. Among first-time prescriptions for which labeled use could be established, ADMs accounted for 85.0% and AOMs accounted for 15.0%. The most common first-time medication was semaglutide (n = 569,413). Among those with available data, 70.4% of first-time ADM prescriptions overall and 74.1% in December 2023 had a fill within 60 days. By comparison, 43.3% of first-time AOM prescriptions overall and 34.9% in December 2023 had a fill within 60 days."

The disease is most prevalent in rural populations with poor access to clean water, health care, and poor environmental hygiene. Current effective efforts to curb the disease include SAFE (surgery, antibiotic treatment, facial hygiene and environmental change) interventions which have shown evidence of real-world effectiveness in the control of trachoma. With the use of SAFE, WHO, governments and other stakeholders vowed to eliminate trachoma by 2020. Though by 2020 people at risk of trachoma had dropped by 90%, few countries including Tanzania were yet to achieve the 2020 goal. Tanzania remained with ten districts highly endemic to trachoma despite regular implementation of the SAFE interventions, suggesting wicked trachoma implementation problems that demand taking different approach to address its complexity. Such an approach will be design thinking to enable identification of effective novel SAFE implementation strategy that is human centered that enables the understanding of those at risk of Trachoma consequently improving access and the utilization of SAFE interventions.Aim This study aims to gain an understanding of the challenges experienced by communities to access SAFE interventions in the Trachoma endemic areas including stakeholders enabling the understanding of their perceptions, feelings, and behaviors regarding the trachoma implementation interventions. Consequently enabling the designing of effective and innovative human-centered approaches to enhance the implementation of SAFE strategies in the endemic communities.Methods the study will be implemented in two villages in Manyara region where Trachoma is persistent despite several rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) over several years. It is a design think approach with five phases iteratively. The study will be in two main phases staring with rapid assessment which will employe Trachoma implementation documents and qualitative interviews of selected stakeholders. Its aim will be to understand the ongoing implementation of SAFE interventions performance, promoting and also impeding contexts. Phase two will then follow and will employ five-phased design thinking approach to comprehend the SAFE target population. The design thinking will start with empathy phase, followed with define, ideation, prototyping and finally testing the resulting innovations. As an iterative process each of the subsequent phases will be informed by the previous phase.The rapid assessment will identify challenges that need exploration, refine research methods and tools, and finalize selection of teams and stakeholders to be involved in the study. The empathy phase will involve obtaining information to gain a deeper understanding of the SAFE target population. Data collection methods during this phase will include qualitative interview, observations, workshops, taking photos and videos. The define phase will involve analyzing information obtained from the empathy phase to develop actionable problem statements that will provide guidance to the next phases. During the ideation phase, in collaboration with the SAFE target population and stakeholders, the research team will formulate possible solutions to address each of the identified problem statements from the define phase. In the prototype phase, the researchers, the SAFE target population and other stakeholders will work together to create an innovative product identified from possible solutions in the ideation phase, which has a high probability of solving SAFE implementation challenges. The final test phase will involve testing the innovative interventions identified in the prototype phase to assess desirability, feasibility, and viability among the SAFE target population follow-up interviews, and observations. A product with such with such qualities of desirability, feasibility, and viability of the innovative product would then passed for future roll out.Ethical clearance will be obtained from the Hubert Kairuki Memorial University (HKMU) Institutional Research Ethics Committee and permission to conduct the study will be obtained from relevant local authorities. Informed consent will be sought from local authorities and participants before any data collection round. Anonymity and confidentiality will be observed during and after data collection round.Author summary Trachoma is leading causes of blindness affecting approximately 8 million people globally. The disease is most prevalent in rural populations with poor access to clean water, health care, and poor environmental hygiene. It is an eye infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis which is transmitted from eye to eye through direct or indirect transfer of eye and nose discharges of infected person to uninfected persons. Most of the infection among children 1-9 years and their mothers, however blindness occurs among those 20 years and above. Efforts to control trachoma were intensified in 1996 when Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 (GET2020) was declared through surgery for people with eye trachomatous trichiasis, mass drug administration for those at risk of infection living in endemic districts, face washing and adequate environmental hygiene with acronym SAFE.Assessments at the end of the time frame in 2020 there was around 92% reduction in the number of people at risk of Trachoma. Thus, about ten percent of the countries had not achieved the goal including Tanzania where ten districts were experiencing Trachoma recrudescence or persistence as global problem despite several rounds of mass administration of Azithromycin. Thus, there was an implementation failure which by using design thinking approach will lead to identification of an innovative strategy that will address this implementation problem. It is funded by Bill and Melinda foundation and ethical clearance will be obtained from the Hubert Kairuki Memorial University in Dar es Salaam Tanzania."

With rapid development in deep learning for image analysis in the last decade and the well-known association between micro- and macrovascular complications, some recent studies focused on the prediction of cardiovascular risk using retinal fundus images. The objective of this scoping review is to identify and describe studies using retinal fundus images and deep learning to predict cardiovascular risk markers and diseases.Methods We searched MEDLINE and Embase for peer-reviewed articles on 17 November 2023. Abstracts and relevant full-text articles were independently screened by two reviewers. We included studies that used deep learning for the analysis of retinal fundus images to predict cardiovascular risk markers (e.g. blood pressure, coronary artery calcification, intima-media thickness) or cardiovascular diseases (prevalent or incident). Studies that used only predefined characteristics of retinal fundus images (e.g. tortuosity, fractal dimension) were not considered. Study characteristics were extracted by the first author and verified by the senior author. Results are presented using descriptive statistics.Results We included 24 articles in the review, published between 2018 and 2023. Among these, 21 (88%) were cross-sectional studies and eight (33%) were follow-up studies with outcome of clinical CVD. Five studies included a combination of both designs. Most studies (n=23, 96%) used convolutional neural networks to process images. We found nine (38%) studies that incorporated clinical risk factors in the prediction and four (17%) that compared the results to commonly used clinical risk scores in a prospective setting. Three of these reported improved discriminative performance. External validation of models was rare (n=5, 21%). Only four (17%) studies made their code publicly available.Conclusions There is an increasing interest in using retinal fundus images in cardiovascular risk assessment. However, there is a need for more prospective studies, comparisons of results to clinical risk scores and models augmented with traditional risk factors. Moreover, more extensive code sharing is necessary to make findings reproducible and more impactful beyond a specific study."

In this study we propose a novel statistical method, Mendelian Randomization analysis based on Z-scores (MRZ), to conduct robust and accurate MR analysis in the presence of pleiotropy. MRZ models the IV-outcome association z-score as a mixture distribution, separating the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome from pleiotropic effects specific to each IV. By classifying IVs into distinct categories (valid, uncorrelated pleiotropic, and correlated pleiotropic), MRZ constructs a likelihood function to estimate both causal and pleiotropic effects. Simulation studies demonstrate MRZ’s robustness, power, and accuracy in identifying causal effects under diverse pleiotropic scenarios and overlapped samples. In a bidirectional MR analysis of appendicular lean mass (ALM) and four lipid traits using both the UK Biobank (UKB)-internal datasets and the UKB-Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) joint datasets, MRZ consistently identified a causal effect of ALM on total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Conversely, existing methods often detected mutual causal relationship between lipid traits and ALM, highlighting their susceptibility to confounding by horizontal pleiotropy. A randomized controlled experiment conducted in mice validated the absence of causal effect of TC on ALM, corroborating the MRZ findings and further emphasizing its resilience against pleiotropic biases."

KE is hypothesized to have beneficial metabolic effects on health and performance, especially in older adults. Whilst many studies have investigated the ketogenic effect of KE in young adults, they have not been studied in an exclusively older adult population, for whom age-related differences in body composition and metabolism may alter the effects. This randomized, observational, open-label study in healthy older adults (n = 30, 50% male, age = 76.5 years, BMI = 25.2 kg/m2) aimed to elucidate acute tolerance, blood BHB and blood glucose concentrations for 4 hours following consumption of either 12.5 or 25 g of BO-BD formulated firstly as a ready-to-drink beverage (n = 30), then as a re-constituted powder (n = 21), taken with a standard meal. Both serving sizes and formulations of BO-BD were well tolerated, and increased blood BHB, inducing nutritional ketosis (≥ 0.5mM) that lasted until the end of the study. Ketosis was dose responsive; peak BHB concentration (Cmax) and incremental area under the curve (iAUC) were significantly greater with 25 g compared to 12.5 g of BO-BD in both formulations. There were no significant differences in Cmax or iAUC between formulations. Blood glucose increased in all conditions following the meal; there were no consistent significant differences in glucose response between conditions. These results demonstrate that both powder and beverage formulations of the novel KE, BO-BD, induce ketosis in healthy older adults, facilitating future research on functional effects of this ingredient in aging."

Achieving guideline-recommended LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) targets remains challenging for patients with and without diabetes. This study aims to compare clinical differences between STEMI patients with and without diabetes and evaluate lipid-lowering strategies on admission and on discharge.METHODS Retrospective study on STEMI patients admitted to our center between 2021 and 2023. Data included anthropometric details, lipid profiles, cardiovascular risk scores and drug therapy. Theoretical LLT potency allowed computation of LDL-C levels as if they hadn’t undergone any LLT therapy (wild LDL-C).RESULTS Of 467 screened patients, 443 were included, with 72 having diabetes. Statistically significant differences were observed in hypertension (72.2% vs. 56.3%, p < 0.001) and peripheral arterial disease prevalence (15.2% vs. 6.2%, p = 0.01). Non-diabetic patients had higher total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels but similar wild LDL-C (110.7 mg/dL vs. 117.5 mg/dL, p = 0.30). At admission, 50.0% (diabetic) and 81.1% (non-diabetic) did not achieve LDL-C targets (p < 0.001). At discharge, 31.9% (diabetic) and 36.6% (non-diabetic) were discharged without sufficient LLT to achieve target cholesterol levels (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION A significant proportion of patients, especially those with diabetes, failed to attain recommended LDL-C targets at STEMI admission. Aggressive lipid-lowering interventions, in particular with the support of electronic tools to assess LLT potency, are crucial for prompt LDL-C target attainment.HighlightsAt admission significant proportion of STEMI patients, including those with diabetes, fail to achieve LDL-C targets for their risk class in primary prevention.Limited adoption of combination therapies with ezetimibe.High-potency statins commonly prescribed at discharge, but many patients forecasted not to achieve LDL-C targets.Tailored treatment regimens utilizing electronic tools crucial for prompt attainment of LDL-C targets post-STEMI."

Driver mutations in mitotic cell cycle genes and cell cycle upregulation have been reported as the major molecular underpinnings of WGD tumors. However, the underlying genomic signatures and regulatory networks involved in gene transcription and kinase phosphorylation remain unclear. Here, we aimed to comprehensively decipher the molecular landscape underlying WGD tumors.Methods We performed a pan-cancer proteogenomic analysis and compared 10 cancer types by integrating genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic datasets from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). We also integrated the cancer dependency data of each cancer cell line and the survival properties of each cancer patient to propose promising therapeutic targets for patients with WGD.Results Our study delineated distinct copy number signatures characterizing WGD-positive tumors into three major groups: highly unstable genome, focal instability, and tetraploidy. Furthermore, the analysis revealed the heterogeneous mechanisms underlying WGD across cancer types with specific structural variation patterns. Upregulation of the cell cycle and downregulation of the immune response were found to be specific to certain WGD tumor types. Transcription factors (TFs) and kinases exhibit cancer-specific activities, emphasizing the need for tailored therapeutic approaches.Conclusion This study introduces an integrative approach to identify potential TF targets for drug development, highlighting BPTF as a promising candidate for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, drug repurposing strategies have been proposed, suggesting potential drugs for the treatment of WGD-associated cancers. Our findings offer insights into the heterogeneity of WGD and have implications for precision medicine approaches for cancer treatment."

Medical records and other relevant data were collected for each participant. To evaluate participants’ adaptive functioning, trained professionals conducted assessments using the Vineland–3 Adaptive Behavior Scales. The assessment compared individuals with epilepsy to those without seizures and covered the domains of communication, daily living skills, socialization, and maladaptive behaviors. Further comparisons were drawn based on insights from interviews and information extracted from participants’ medical records.RESULTS Thirty-nine individuals (22 males, 17 females) with KBG syndrome, confirmed through genetic analysis, were interviewed via videoconferencing by a single physician, followed by Vineland-3 assessment by trained raters. Individuals with KBG syndrome came from 36 unique families spanning 11 countries. While the KBG cohort displayed lower overall adaptive behavior composite scores compared to the average population, several members displayed standard scores at or higher than average, as well as higher scores compared to those with the neurodevelopmental disorder Ogden syndrome. Within the KBG cohort, males consistently scored lower than females across all domains, but none of these categories reached statistical significance. While the group with epilepsy exhibited overall lower scores than the non-seizure group in every category, statistical significance was only reached in the written communication subdomain. We predict this lack of significance is limited by low sample size, reducing study power.CONCLUSIONS Due to the rarity of KBG syndrome, our research provides valuable insights that can aid in epilepsy screening and inform assessment strategies for neurocognitive functioning in those with this condition. The cohort performed overall higher than expected with outliers existing in both directions. Although our results suggest that seizures might influence the trajectory of KBG syndrome, the approaching but overall absence of statistical significance between study groups underscores the necessity for a more extensive cohort to discern subtle variations in functioning. Conducting Vineland–3 assessments in the KBG syndrome population can enhance research insights regarding differences between those with and without epilepsy. Given the data collected, we recommend vigilant monitoring for seizures following a KBG diagnosis, with consideration for performing baseline EEG assessments."

One way to address this is through the identification of epigenomic biomarkers associated with exposures. There is increasing evidence suggesting that exposure to toxic substances may result in alterations to DNA methylation and resultant gene expression. These epigenomic changes may lead to adverse health effects for exposed individuals and their offspring. While the development of epigenomic biomarkers for exposures could facilitate understanding of these exposure-related health effects, such testing could also provide unwanted information.Objectives Explore Veterans’ attitudes toward epigenomic biomarker research and the potential to test for past exposures that could pose intergenerational risk.Methods Semi-structured interviews with Veterans (n=22) who experienced potentially harmful exposures during their military service.Results Twenty Veterans said they would hypothetically want to receive epigenomic information related to their toxic exposures and potential health impacts as part of a research study. Veterans identified nine potential benefits of this research, including promoting insights concerning intergenerational health, identification of early health interventions to mitigate the impact of exposures, and additional knowledge or explanation for their experiences. At the same time, 16 participants noted potential risks, including psychological distress in response to results, concerns about receiving non-actionable, uncertain, or inaccurate results, and issues related to privacy and discrimination. Ten participants also identified at least one condition in their children that they thought could be related to their exposure and most said they would be interested in receiving research results related to their children’s and grandchildren’s risk of developing a health condition associated with their exposure.Discussion Results suggest that Veterans might welcome benefits of epigenomic research related to military exposures yet have some concerns about potential negative impacts."

However, uncertainties about patient adherence and the significant resource requirements needed create challenges to adoption of remote monitoring into clinical care. Here we aim to determine the impact of a novel digital application to overcome these barriers. The Rehabilitation Remote Monitoring Application (RRMA) automatically extracts data about physical activity collected via a Fitbit device, screens the data for adherence, and contacts the participant if adherence is low. We compare adherence and estimate the resources required (i.e., time and financial) to perform remote monitoring of physical activity with and without the RRMA in two patient groups. Seventy-three individuals with stroke or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease completed 28 days of monitoring physical activity with the RRMA, while 62 individuals completed 28 days with the data flow processes being completed manually. Adherence (i.e., the average percentage of the day that the device was worn) was similar between groups (p=0.85). However, the RRMA saved an estimated 123.8 minutes or $50.24 per participant month when compared to manual processes. These results demonstrate that automated technologies like the RRMA can maintain patient adherence to remote monitoring of physical activity while reducing the time and financial resources needed. Applications like the RRMA can facilitate the adoption of remote monitoring in rehabilitation by reducing barriers related to adherence and resource requirements."

The incorporation of LMMs into clinical medicine presents unique challenges, including accuracy, reliability, and clinical relevance. Here, we explore clinical applications of GPT-4V, an LMM that has been proposed for use in medicine, in gastroenterology, radiology, dermatology, and United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) test questions. We used standardized robust datasets with thousands of endoscopy images, chest x-ray, and skin lesions to benchmark GPT-4V’s ability to predict diagnoses. To assess bias, we also explored GPT-4V’s ability to determine Fitzpatrick skin tones with dermatology images. We found that GPT-4V is limited in performance across all four domains, resulting in decreased performance compared to previously published baseline models. The macro-average precision, recall, and F1-score for gastroenterology were 11.2%, 9.1% and 6.8% respectively. For radiology, the best performing task of identifying cardiomegaly had precision, recall, and F1-score of 28%, 94%, and 43% respectively. In dermatology, GPT-4V had an overall top-1 and top-3 diagnostic accuracy of 6.2% and 21% respectively. There was a significant accuracy drop when predicting images of darker skin tones (p<0.001). GPT-4V accurately identified Fitzpatrick skin tones for 56.5% of images. For the multiple-choice-styled USMLE image-based test questions, GPT-4V had an accuracy of 59%. Our findings demonstrate that the current version of GPT-4V is limited in its diagnostic abilities across multiple image-based medical specialties. Future work should be done to explore LMM’s sensitivity to prompting as well as hybrid models that can combine LMM’s capabilities with other robust models."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and estimated effect sizes of the AMPA-R antagonist, perampanel, on intraoperative electrophysiologic hyperexcitability and clinical outcomes.Methods An open-label trial was performed comparing perampanel to standard of care (SOC) in patients undergoing resection of newly-diagnosed radiologic high-grade glioma. Perampanel was administered as a pre-operative loading dose followed by maintenance therapy until progressive disease or up to 12-months. SOC treatment involved levetiracetam for 7-days or as clinically indicated. The primary outcome of hyperexcitability was defined by intra-operative electrocorticography high frequency oscillation (HFO) rates. Seizure-freedom and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Tissue concentrations of perampanel, levetiracetam, and metabolites were measured by mass spectrometry.Results HFO rates were similar between perampanel-treated and SOC cohorts. The trial was terminated early after interim analysis for futility, and outcomes assessed in 11 patients (7 perampanel-treated, 4 SOC). Over a median 281 days of post-enrollment follow-up, 27% of patients had seizures, including 14% treated with perampanel and 50% treated with SOC. OS in perampanel-treated patients was similar to a glioblastoma reference cohort (p=0.81). Glutamate concentrations in surface biopsies were positively correlated with HFO rates in adjacent electrode contacts and were not significantly associated with treatment assignment or drug concentrations.Conclusions A peri-operative loading regimen of perampanel was safe and well-tolerated, with similar peritumoral hyperexcitability as in levetiracetam-treated patients. Maintenance anti-glutamatergic therapy was not observed to impact survival outcomes."

In a randomized trial, participants offered community health worker (CHW) support and primary care provider (PCP) education had higher tobacco abstinence rates at two years, partly through increased tobacco cessation pharmacotherapy initiation. This study determined the association between participant-CHW engagement and tobacco abstinence outcomes.Methods This was a secondary, mixed-methods analysis of 196 participants in the trial’s intervention arm. Effects of CHW visit number and duration, CHW co-led smoking cessation group sessions attended, and CHW-attended PCP visit number on tobacco use disorder pharmacotherapy initiation and tobacco abstinence were modeled using logistic regression. Interviews with 12 CHWs, 16 participants, and 17 PCPs were analyzed thematically.Results Year-two tobacco abstinence was associated with CHW visit number (OR=1.85, 95% CI=[1.29, 2.66]) and duration (OR=1.85, 95% CI=[1.33, 2.58]) and number of groups attended (OR=1.51, 95% CI=[1.00, 2.28]); effects on pharmacotherapy initiation were similar. 1-3 CHW visits per month over two years was optimal for achieving abstinence. Interviews identified engagement facilitators, including CHWs establishing trust, providing goal accountability, skills reinforcement, and assistance overcoming barriers to treatment access and adherence related to social determinants of health and illness factors. Robust training and supervision facilitated CHW effectiveness. Barriers included PCPs’ and care teams’ limited understanding of the CHW role.Conclusions Feasible CHW engagement was associated with tobacco abstinence in adults with serious mental illness. CHW implementation may benefit from promoting CHW training and integration within clinical teams.HighlightsGreater participant engagement with community health workers (CHWs) (e.g., visit number, duration) was associated with higher tobacco abstinence rates in a two-year intervention for adults with serious mental illness and tobacco use disorder.Interviews with participants, CHWs, and primary care providers (PCPs) indicated that CHWs built trust, facilitated health behavior change, helped participants overcome adverse social determinants of health and other barriers to obtaining effective tobacco use disorder treatment.Training and supervision were perceived to be essential to CHW effectiveness; CHWs and PCPs suggested insufficient integration of CHWs into psychiatric rehabilitation and healthcare teams as an addressable implementation barrier."

Methods to mitigate bias involve approaches after training leading to tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. There have been limited efforts to address bias at the level of the data for algorithm generation.Methods We generate a data-centric, but algorithm-agnostic approach to evaluate dataset bias by investigating how the relationships between different groups are learned at different sample sizes. We name this method AEquity and define a metric AEq. We then apply a systematic analysis of AEq values across subpopulations to identify and mitigate manifestations of racial bias.Findings We demonstrate that AEquity helps mitigate different biases in three different chest radiograph datasets, a healthcare costs dataset, and when using tabularized electronic health record data for mortality prediction. In the healthcare costs dataset, we show that AEquity is a more sensitive metric of label bias than model performance. AEquity can be utilized for label selection when standard fairness metrics fail. In the chest radiographs dataset, we show that AEquity can help optimize dataset selection to mitigate bias, as measured by nine different fairness metrics across nine of the most frequent diagnoses and four different protected categories (race, sex, insurance status, age) and the intersections of race and sex. We benchmark against approaches currently used after algorithm training including recalibration and balanced empirical risk minimization. Finally, we utilize AEquity to characterize and mitigate a previously unreported bias in mortality prediction with the widely used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, showing that AEquity outperforms currently used approaches, and is effective at both small and large sample sizes.Interpretation AEquity can identify and mitigate bias in known biased datasets through different strategies and an unreported bias in a widely used dataset.Summary AEquity, a machine learning approach can identify and mitigate bias the level of datasets used to train algorithms. We demonstrate it can mitigate known cases of bias better than existing methods, and detect and mitigate bias that was previously unreported.Evidence before this study Methods to mitigate algorithmic bias typically involve adjustments made after training, leading to a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. There have been limited efforts to mitigate bias at the level of the data.Added value of this study This study introduces a machine learning based method, AEquity, which analyzes the learnability of data from subpopulations at different sample sizes, which can then be used to intervene on the larger dataset to mitigate bias. The study demonstrates the detection and mitigation of bias in two scenarios where bias had been previously reported. It also demonstrates the detection and mitigation of bias the widely used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, which was previously unknown.Implications of all available evidence AEquity is a complementary approach that can be used early in the algorithm lifecycle to characterize and mitigate bias and thus prevent perpetuation of algorithmic disparities."

Temporal network analysis can detect causal dependence between and within prodromal features by representing prodromal features as nodes, with their connections (edges) indicating the likelihood of one feature preceding the other. In SMD, node centrality could reveal insights into important prodromal features and potential intervention targets. Community analysis can identify commonly occurring feature groups to define SMD at-risk states.Objective To develop a global transdiagnostic SMD network of the temporal relationships between prodromal features, and to examine within-group differences with sub-networks specific to UMD, BMD and PSYDesign Retrospective (2-year), real-world, electronic health records (EHR) cohort study. Validated natural language processing algorithms extracted the occurrence of 61 prodromal features every three months from two years to six months prior to SMD onset. To construct temporal networks of prodromal features, we employed generalized vector autoregression panel analysis, adjusting for covariates.Setting South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust EHRs.Participants 7,049 individuals with an SMD diagnosis (UMD:2,306; BMD:817; PSY:3,926).Main Outcomes Edge weights (correlation coefficients, z) in autocorrelative, unidirectional and bidirectional relationships. Centrality was calculated as the sum of connections leaving (out-centrality, cout) or entering (in-centrality, cin) a node. The three sub-networks (UMD, BMD, PSY) were compared using permutation analysis. Community analysis was performed using Spinglass.Results The SMD network was characterised by unidirectional positive relationships, with aggression (cout=.082) and tearfulness (cin=.124) as the most central features. The PSY sub-network showed few significant differences compared to UMD (3.9%) and BMD (1.6%), and UMD-BMD showed even fewer (0.4%). Two positive psychotic (delusional thinking-hallucinations-paranoia, and aggression-agitation-hostility) and one depressive community (guilt-poor insight-tearfulness) were the most common.Conclusions and Relevance This study represents the most extensive temporal network analysis conducted on the longitudinal interplay of SMD prodromal features. These findings provide further evidence to support transdiagnostic early detection services across SMD, refine assessments to detect individuals at risk and identify central features as potential intervention targets.Question How does the dynamic evolution of the prodrome differ across severe mental disorder (SMD) diagnostic groups (unipolar mood disorders, bipolar mood disorders and psychotic disorders) in secondary mental healthcare?Findings This large temporal network analysis study (n=7,049) highlights a transdiagnostic overlap in the pattern of progression of prodromal symptoms of different SMD diagnostic groups in secondary mental healthcare.Meaning Transdiagnostic early detection services for SMD may be beneficial in extending the benefits of preventive psychiatry. We have identified prodromal symptoms that are central to SMD onset, which could be useful targets for preventive interventions to disrupt the progression of SMD."

High hereditary rates (50-80%) of CL/P indicate a strong genetic cause. The concept of strong genetic causes has been well-demonstrated in previous studies such as GWAS studies that identified IRF6 for Van der Woode syndrome. Since the risk for genetic factors is strongly associated with CL/P, we hypothesized that RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from CL/P patients may reveal enriched genes. Differential expression analysis examined changes in gene expression in CL/P patients compared to healthy controls, and gene-enrichment in relevant pathways. To explore the relationship between variants driving the observed changes in gene expression, we performed variant analysis and reported all CL/P-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our findings demonstrate that the normally upregulated MUC7 gene is significantly downregulated in CL/P patients. Using our list of prioritized differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we observed significantly enriched pathways for biological processes related to cornification, skin and epidermis development, and keratinocyte and epidermal cell differentiation. By performing variant analyses, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in MUC7, and 47 SNPs in 20 additional genes (CLCA4, ETNK2, ERLNC1, HAL, HOPX, IVL, KLK11, LIPK, LY6D, MUC21, NCCRP1, NEBL, PHYH, SERPINB11, SERPINB4, SORD, SPINK5, SULT2B1, TMEM154, TMPRSS11A) were revealed. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the potential role of MUC7 in contributing to CL/P. Together, these findings provide further insight into the genetic causes of CL/P."

In particular, these algorithms can be very helpful in delineating brain abnormalities (lesions, tumors, lacunas, etc), enabling the extraction of information such as volume and location, that can inform doctors or feed predictive models. Here, we describe ResectVol DL, a fully automatic tool developed to segment resective lacunas in brain images of patients with epilepsy. ResectVol DL relies on the nnU-Net framework that leverages the 3D U-Net deep learning architecture. T1-weighted MRI datasets from 120 patients (57 women; 31.5 ± 15.9 years old at surgery) were used to train (n=78) and test (n=48) our tool. Manual segmentations were carried out by five different raters and were considered as ground truth for performance assessment. We compared ResectVol DL with two other fully automatic methods: ResectVol 1.1.2 and DeepResection, using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and relative difference to manual segmentation. ResectVol DL presented the highest median DSC (0.92 vs. 0.78 and 0.90), the highest correlation coefficient (0.99 vs. 0.63 and 0.94), and the lowest median relative difference (9 vs. 44 and 12 %). Overall, we demonstrate that ResectVol DL accurately segments brain lacunas, which has the potential to assist in the development of predictive models for postoperative cognitive and seizure outcomes."

While imaging the retina may provide insights on central nervous system-related disorders such as schizophrenia, a typical challenge are confounders often present in schizophrenia which may negatively impact retinal health. Here, we therefore aimed to investigate retinal changes in the context of common genetic variations conveying a risk of schizophrenia as measured by polygenic risk scores. We used population data from the UK Biobank, including White British and Irish individuals without diagnosed schizophrenia, and estimated a polygenic risk score for schizophrenia based on the newest genome-wide association study (PGC release 2022). We hypothesized that greater genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia is associated with retinal thinning, especially within the macula. To gain additional mechanistic insights, we conducted pathway-specific polygenic risk score associations analyses, focusing on gene pathways that are related to schizophrenia. Of 65484 individuals recruited, 48208 participants with available matching imaging-genetic data were included in the analysis of whom 22427 (53.48%) were female and 25781 (46.52%) were male. Our robust principal component regression results showed that polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia were associated with retinal thinning while controlling for confounding factors (b = −0.03, p = 0.007, pFWER = 0.01). Similarly, we found that polygenic risk for schizophrenia specific to neuroinflammation gene sets revealed significant associations with retinal thinning (b = −0.03, self-contained p = 0.041 (reflecting the level of association), competitive p = 0.05 (reflecting the level of enrichment)). These results go beyond previous studies suggesting a relationship between manifested schizophrenia and retinal phenotypes. They indicate that the retina is a mirror reflecting the genetic complexities of schizophrenia and that alterations observed in the retina of individuals with schizophrenia may be connected to an inherent genetic predisposition to neurodegenerative aspects of the condition. These associations also suggest the potential involvement of the neuroinflammatory pathway, with indications of genetic overlap with specific retinal phenotypes. The findings further indicate that this gene pathway in individuals with a high polygenic risk for schizophrenia could contribute through acute-phase proteins to structural changes in the retina."

The intervention was designed to increase the difficulty of the bicycle BC task in a stepwise fashion, gradually approaching the difficulty of bicycle BC on the public roads. The intervention lasted 11 weeks and involved three components: (1) training on an exercise bicycle, (2) BC training on a bicycle simulator, and (3) cycling on the public roads with a safe start-and-stop technique that was practiced on the bicycle simulator. This intervention produced a very large improvement (Cohen’s d = 1.8) in BC skills and confidence on the public roads. The fact that bicycle BC skills and confidence can be drastically improved over a relatively short period does not rule out the likely role of the slower process of acquiring a sufficient lower body strength."

Manual curation efforts are slow and often disease specific, while efforts relying on single sources are too inaccurate and may result in false-positive or false-negative genes.Methods We established the MorbidGenes panel based on a list of publicly available databases: OMIM, PanelApp, SysNDD, ClinVar, HGMD and GenCC. A simple logic allows inclusion of genes that are supported by at least one of these sources, providing a list of all genes with diagnostic relevance.Results The panel is freely available at https://morbidgenes.uni-leipzig.de and currently includes 4960 genes (as of March 2024) with minimally sufficient evidence on disease causality to classify them as diagnostically relevant.Conclusion The MorbidGenes panel is an open and comprehensive overview of diagnostically relevant rare disease genes based on a diverse set of resources.

This systematic review aimed to identify and synthesise findings across qualitative studies exploring the impact of gender on this transition process.Methods Peer-reviewed literature was drawn from a multi-database search, limited to qualitative studies. The studies included either female veterans or both male and female veterans aged 18 years or older who had previously served in the Armed Forces within the Five Eyes (FVEY) countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States). We used a Framework Analysis approach to guide the synthesis of the qualitative data. An assessment of study quality was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Qualitative Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Studies. The study protocol is registered with the Open Science Framework (osf.io/5stuj).Results In total, 10,113 articles were screened after the removal of duplicates, 161 underwent full-text review, with 19 meeting the eligibility criteria. The review identified twelve themes split across individual’s experience whilst serving and after transitioning out of the military service. Both male and female veterans discussed a period of acculturation when they joined service and adapted to military norms, culture and identity. Female veterans faced additional challenges at this stage centred on the conflict between feminine norms and the military masculine ideal. Upon leaving service both male and female veterans experienced a loss of military identity and purpose, and dissonance with civilian norms illustrating a military-civilian divide. For female veterans, adjustments and adaptations learned in the military clashed with civilian feminine norms and stereotypically male veteran culture. Female veterans also struggled with the legacies of gender inequality, discrimination, and sexual assault which affected their development of a female veteran identity and affected the provision of services designed to meet their needs as a female. Despite these challenges, female veterans’ expressed pride in their service and accomplishments.Conclusions Any effort to improve the military-to-civilian transition should take account of the legacy of gender discrimination, especially within the military service, and the potential mismatch between historical civilian female norms and the more traditionally masculine norms of military life.Disclosures This project was supported by a grant from the Forces in Mind Trust (FiMT) 2202.

We have previously leveraged the pleiotropic genetic relationships between schizophrenia and two cognitive phenotypes (educational attainment and cognitive task performance) to differentiate two subsets of illness-relevant SNPs: (1) those with “concordant” alleles, which are associated with reduced cognitive ability/education and increased schizophrenia risk; and (2) those with “discordant” alleles linked to reduced educational and/or cognitive levels but lower schizophrenia susceptibility. In the present study, we extend our prior work, utilizing larger input GWAS datasets and a more powerful statistical approach to pleiotropic meta-analysis, the Pleiotropic Locus Exploration and Interpretation using Optimal test (PLEIO). Our pleiotropic meta-analysis of schizophrenia and the two cognitive phenotypes revealed 768 significant loci (159 novel). Among these, 347 loci harbored concordant SNPs, 270 encompassed discordant SNPs, and 151 “dual” loci contained concordant and discordant SNPs. Competitive gene-set analysis using MAGMA related concordant SNP loci with neurodevelopmental pathways (e.g., neurogenesis), whereas discordant loci were associated with mature neuronal synaptic functions. These distinctions were also observed in BrainSpan analysis of temporal enrichment patterns across developmental periods, with concordant loci containing more prenatally expressed genes than discordant loci. Dual loci were enriched for genes related to mRNA translation initiation, representing a novel finding in the schizophrenia literature."

Yet, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir failed as post-exposure prophylaxis in a trial, and frequent viral rebound has been observed in subsequent cohorts. We developed a mathematical model capturing viral-immune dynamics and nirmatrelvir pharmacokinetics that recapitulated viral loads from this and another clinical trial (PLATCOV). Our results suggest that nirmatrelvir’s in vivo potency is significantly lower than in vitro assays predict. According to our model, a maximally potent agent would reduce the viral load by approximately 3.5 logs relative to placebo at 5 days. The model identifies that earlier initiation and shorter treatment duration are key predictors of post-treatment rebound. Extension of treatment to 10 days for Omicron variant infection in vaccinated individuals, rather than increasing dose or dosing frequency, is predicted to lower the incidence of viral rebound significantly."

We provide new estimates of the proportions of AD and all-cause dementia attributable to carriage of the ε3 and ε4 APOE alleles.METHODS We conducted a cohort study using genetic and electronic health record data from 171,128 participants of UK Biobank, aged ≥60 years at baseline. AD and all-cause dementia were ascertained at baseline and during follow-up for up to 16.8 years.RESULTS 74.0% (95% CI: 37.8, 89.1) of AD and 38.1% (95% CI: 9.8, 57.6%) of all-cause dementia burden were attributable to a combination of ε3 and ε4 carriage. Approximately 30% of AD was attributable to ε3 carriage specifically.DISCUSSION Differences in apolipoprotein E are responsible for most AD and a large fraction of all dementia. Research into this pathway should be prioritised to facilitate dementia prevention."

To date, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has identified five unique clades of C. auris, with some strains displaying resistance to all primary antifungal drug classes. In this study, we presented the first WGS analysis of C. auris from Bangladesh, describing its origins, transmission dynamics, and antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) profile. Ten C. auris isolates collected from hospital settings in Bangladesh were initially identified by CHROMagar™ Candida Plus, followed by VITEK®2 system and later sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 550 system. Reference-based phylogenetic analysis and variant calling pipelines were used to classify the isolates in different clades. All isolates aligned ∼90% with the Clade I C. auris B11205 reference genome. Of the ten isolates, eight clustered with Clade I isolates, highlighting a South Asian lineage prevalent in Bangladesh. Remarkably, the remaining two isolates formed a distinct cluster, exhibiting >42,447 SNP differences compared to their closest Clade IV counterparts. This significant variation corroborates the emergence of a sixth clade (Clade VI) of C. auris in Bangladesh, with potential for international transmission. AFST results showed that 80% of the C. auris isolates were resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole, whereas Clade VI isolates were susceptible to azoles, echinocandins, and pyrimidine analogue. Genomic sequencing revealed ERG11_Y132F mutation conferring azole resistance while FCY1_S70R mutation found inconsequential in describing 5-flucytosine resistance. Our study underscores the pressing need for comprehensive genomic surveillance in Bangladesh to better understand the emergence, transmission dynamics, and resistance profiles of C. auris infections. Unveiling the discovery of a sixth clade (Clade VI) accentuates the indispensable role of advanced sequencing methodologies.IMPORTANCE Candida auris is a nosocomial fungal pathogen which is commonly misidentified as other Candida species. Since its emergence in 2009, this multi-drug resistant fungus has become one of the five urgent antimicrobial threat by 2019. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) has proven to be the most accurate identification technique of C. auris which also played a crucial role in the initial discovery of this pathogen. WGS analysis of C. auris has revealed five distinct clades where isolates of each clade differ among themselves based on pathogenicity, colonization, infection mechanism as well as other phenotypic characteristics. In Bangladesh, C. auris was 1st reported in 2019 from clinical samples of a large hospital of Dhaka city. To understand the origin, transmission dynamics and antifungal resistance profile of C. auris isolates circulating in Bangladesh, we conducted WGS based surveillance study on two of the largest hospital settings in Dhaka, Bangladesh."

Here, we further explore how tobacco exposure contributes to cancer development by mutational signature analysis of 265 whole-genome sequenced HNC from eight countries. Six tobacco-associated mutational signatures were detected, including some not previously reported. Differences in HNC incidence between countries corresponded with differences in mutation burdens of tobacco-associated signatures, consistent with the dominant role of tobacco in HNC causation. Differences were found in the burden of tobacco-associated signatures between anatomical subsites, suggesting that tissue-specific factors modulate mutagenesis. We identified an association between tobacco smoking and three additional alcohol-related signatures indicating synergism between the two exposures. Tobacco smoking was associated with differences in the mutational spectra and repertoire of driver mutations in cancer genes, and in patterns of copy number change. Together, the results demonstrate the multiple pathways by which tobacco smoke can influence the evolution of cancer cell clones."

Latent class analysis (LCA) can identify unrecognized morbidity patterns for decedents with COVID-19.Methods Data were collected from 23 U.S. jurisdictions about decedents with COVID-19 early in the COVID-19 pandemic (February 12–May 12, 2020). LCA identified groups of individuals based upon pre-existing comorbidities: cardiovascular, renal, lung, neurologic, and liver disease; obesity; diabetes; and immunocompromised state. Results were stratified by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and location of death.Results Of 12,340 decedents, LCA identified three classes, which included classes with prominent cardiovascular disease and diabetes (32%), prominent cardiovascular disease without diabetes (19%), and a “minimal prevalence” class (49%) with a low frequency of comorbidities. Individuals in the “minimal prevalence” class had risk factors in <2 comorbidity groups, where cardiovascular disease was the most common for individuals with a single comorbidity.Conclusions LCA analysis reaffirms the importance of diabetes and cardiovascular disease as risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and indicates that about half of decedents were in the “minimal prevalence” group. Results could guide vaccination and treatment messaging to groups with no or few underlying conditions.Disclaimer The conclusions, findings, and opinions expressed by the authors do not necessarily reflect the offical position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the authors’ affililated institutions."

The use of systematic screening has the potential to enhance detection rates; however, there is currently no consensus on the most effective approach. This study ai med to assess the diagnostic test accuracy of five simple sarcopenia screening tools and determine which test has the highest accuracy.Objective To assess and compare the accuracy of five screening tools for sarcopenia in community older adults.Design A systematic review and a network meta analysis.Methods A systematic search was conducted in various databases including Pubmed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and Sinomed up to September 2023. Studies reporting on the accuracy of diagnostic testing for sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults using one or more of the following sarcopenia screening tools were included: Sarcopenia Simple Five-Item Rati ng Scale (SARC-F), SARC-F combined with calf circumference (SA RC-CalF), SARC-F combined with older adults and BMI (SARC-F+ EBM), Mini sarcopenia risk assessment-5 (MSRA-5), and Mini sarcopenia risk assessment-7 (MSRA-7). The reference standard was the Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia (AWGS), the European Working Group on Sarcopenia on Older People (EWGSOP), the Foundation for National Institutes of Health (FNIH), or the International Working Group on Sarcopenia (IWGS). Random-effects bivariate binomial model meta-analyses, meta-regressions and a network meta-analysis were used to estimate the pooled and relative sensitivities and specificities.Results We identified and evaluated 22 papers focused on SARC-F, S ARC-CalF, MSRA-5, and MSRA-7. Traditional meta-analysis sorting results showed summary sensitivities of 0.25, 0.59, 0.43, 0.82, and 0.51, summary specificities of 0.94, 0.82, 0.81, 0.39, and 0.85, summary AUC of 0.80, 0.76, 0.70, 0.68, and 0.75, and summary DOR of 5, 7, 3, 3, and 6. The network meta-analysis ranking results showed that MRSA-5 had the highest sensitivity (92.27) and SARC-F had the highest specificity (99.81) under the cumulative ranking.Linking evidence to action The MSRA can be used as a tool for screening sarcopenia in community older adults, while the SARC-F can be used for first-time diagnosis of sarcopenia in this population. However, it is important to interpret the results with caution due to the variability among different studies analyzing the accuracy of this diagnostic test. Future research should focus on obtaining additional evidence from large sample sizes and high-quality studies."

Similarly, healthcare workers were particularly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, and high levels of distress and mental ill health have been reported.Aim To examine and synthesise qualitative research findings regarding the stressors, and their psychosocial impacts, that healthcare staff faced in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to provide lessons for future support.Method A systematic review, pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022304235), was carried out on papers reporting qualitative research published between January 2021 and January 2022 that focused on the impact of COVID-19 on UK healthcare workers. Findings from 27 qualitative papers were integrated using thematic synthesis.Results Several types of stressors were identified including the SARS-CoV-2 virus, problems related to personal protective equipment, leadership, and communication processes, high workloads, and issues stemming from uncertainty and a lack of knowledge. These stressors were related to a range of adverse psychosocial outcomes including worrying about oneself and others, fatigue, lack of confidence in oneself and in senior managers, impacts on teamwork, and feeling unappreciated or that one’s needs are not recognised.Conclusions Apart from COVID-19 itself (the primary stressor), healthcare staff experienced distress due to ineffective policies, practices and administrative arrangements that were in place before the pandemic, or from insufficient or ineffective responses to the pandemic (secondary stressors). However, secondary stressors can be modified to mitigate their negative effects, thus workforce planning should shift from focusing on individuals towards amending healthcare staff’s psychosocial working environments."

There is a paucity of evidence on the determinants of healthcare insurance coverage among women of reproductive age in Tanzania, therefore this study aimed at assessing factors associated with access to health care insurance among women of reproductive age in Tanzania using national Demographic and health survey dataset.Methodology This study was an analytical cross-sectional study that utilized nationally representative secondary data sourced from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys (TDHS) of 2022.A weighted sample of 15,254 women of reproductive age (15–49) was included in the study. A multilevel regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with health care insurance coverage. These results were presented using adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval.Results In Tanzania the proportion of health insurance coverage among women of reproductive age was 5.8% whereby majority of women subscribing to employer’s insurance (3.9%). Older women (35–49) were more likely to be covered with health insurance compared those aged 15-24 (AOR =2.75, 95% CI: 2.19, 3.45). Similarly, married women had higher likelihood of health insurance coverage compared to unmarried (AOR=1.60, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.92). Furthermore, educated women were more likely to be covered with health insurance than uneducated women (AOR=6.96, 95% CI: 4.74, 10.22). Similarly, women who were exposed to mass media were more likely to be covered with health care insurance compared to unexposed (AOR=1.43, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.78).Conclusion Less than ten percent of Tanzanian women of reproductive age (WRA) are registered in health insurance, which is an unacceptably low coverage. This highlights the urgent need to eliminate barriers preventing this population’s access to healthcare in order to achieve Standard Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. The interplay of socioeconomic factors and access to information underscores the need for multifaceted approaches to enhance healthcare coverage among women of reproductive age in Tanzania."

Attempts for medical growth abrogation have failed. This study aims to elucidate the heterogeneity of AAA based on histomorphology in correlation to individual patient data and aneurysm metrics.Patients and Methods Aneurysm samples from the left anterior wall from four university center biobanks underwent histologic analysis including angiogenesis, calcification, fibrosis, type and grade of inflammation in adventitia and media. Clinical information included age, comorbidities, etc. as well as type of aneurysm (intact, symptomatic, ruptured, inflammatory). Aneurysm morphology included diameter and semi-automated geometric analysis using Endosize© (Therenva) segmentation. Additionally, aneurysm growth was assessed.Results 364 patients’ samples (85.4% male, median age 69 years) demonstrated acute (mix/granulocytes) or chronic (monocytes/plasma cells) type inflammation and score, coherent in adventitia and media (p < 0.001), not associated with the type of aneurysm (52x ruptured; 37x symptomatic; p = 0.51) or diameter (57 [52–69] mm; p = 0.87). The degree of fibrosis and the presence of angiogenesis were significantly higher (both p < 0.001) with increasing inflammation score, which significantly decreased with patient age (est = - 0.015/year, p = 0.017). No significant differences in inflammation, fibrosis or angiogenesis were seen for ruptured (vs. intact), acute (vs. elective), male (vs. female) of diabetic (vs. non) patients, while current smoking was associated with more chronic inflammation (p = 0.007) and a higher degree of fibrosis (p = 0.03). Aneurysm geometric morphology (n=252) or differing annual growth rates (n=142) were not significantly associated with histologic characteristics.Conclusion Type and degree of inflammation are the most distinguishable histologic characteristics in the AAA wall between individual patients. Despite the association to age and smoking status, no significant correlation to any patient or aneurysm specific feature, especially not diameter or rupture exists."

Dementia is characterised by progressive impairment to several cognitive functions including memory and orientation, practical abilities and mood changes, all of which can impact personality and social relationships. The theory of social death has been explored for people living with dementia as the ability to maintain social interactions are threatened leading to a loss of social identity and exclusion and withdrawal from the wider community.A relationship-centred care approach has been recommended to improve care for older people in long-term care, aiming to create environments conducive to relationships, considering the needs of the person living with dementia and also the staff and family members involved in their care. The ‘Senses Framework’ by Nolan was designed to promote relationships, acknowledging the experiences of all parties across six senses: security, continuity, belonging, purpose, fulfilment and significance. Utilising the Senses Framework has the potential to sustain meaningful relationships by fostering a sense of value and empowerment.This Rapid Evidence Summary aims to explore the evidence assessing the benefits of a relationship triad approach (Senses Framework and other relationship-centred care approaches) in long term care settings (including care homes) for people living with dementia. Nine primary studies and one systematic review were identified.The benefits of using a relationship-centred approach were mapped under each of the senses described within the Senses Framework, detailed separately for people living with dementia, relatives and care home staff. For people living with dementia, interventions using touch and music increased the sense of security and belonging reducing neuropsychiatric conditions such as agitation and aggression. Memory boxes were used to support a sense of significance and continuity and significant moments from the past brought pleasure and enabled meaningful conversations. For relatives and staff, improved communication and relationships increased confidence and trust and by working together they found that they could exert more influence and could develop into a powerful force for change."

With the advent of machine learning (ML), promising predictive models have been developed. This study evaluates their performance through a systematic review and meta-analysis.Methods We performed a comprehensive systematic review across multiple databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Eligible studies focused on BSIs within any hospital setting, employing ML models as the diagnostic test. We evaluated the risk of bias with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist and assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Models reporting the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were included in the meta-analysis to identify key performance drivers.Results After screening, a total of 30 studies were eligible for synthesis, from which 41 models and 8 data types were extracted. Most of the studies were carried out in the inpatient settings (n=17; 56%), followed by the emergency department (ED) settings (n=7; 23%), and followed by the ICU settings (n=6; 20%). The reported AUROCs in the hospital inpatients settings, ranged from 0.51-0.866, in the ICU settings AUROCs ranged from 0.668-0.970, and in the emergency department (ED) settings the AUROCs of the models ranged from 0.728-0.844. One study reported prospective cohort study, while two prospectively validated their models. In the meta-analysis, laboratory tests, Complete Blood Count/Differential Count (CBC/DC), and ML model type contributed the most to model performance.Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis show that on retrospective data, individual ML models can accurately predict BSIs at different stages of patient trajectory. Although they enable early prediction of BSI, a comprehensive approach to integrate data types and models is necessary. Systematic reporting, externally validated, and clinical implementation studies are needed to establish clinical confidence."

A survey of treatment priorities for patients with hip-spine syndrome among spine and hip surgeons,"AbstractBackground The optimal sequence of hip and spine surgeries for managing hip-spine syndrome remains controversial.Objective This study aimed to investigate the preferences and rationale for the sequence of surgical treatment of different hip-spine syndrome scenarios among potentially interviewed specialists.Design A questionnaire survey was designed, featuring five fictional clinical presentations of hip-spine syndrome was established. These scenarios included symptomatic hip osteoarthritis and: 1) lumbar spinal stenosis with neurological claudication, 2) lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis with leg pain, 3) lumbar disc herniation with leg weakness, 4) lumbar scoliosis with back pain, and 5) thoracolumbar disc herniation with myelopathy.Methods The survey was conducted among German hip and spine surgeons to inquire their preferred surgical sequence and treatment rationale. Additionally, a cross-nation comparison of the German findings was made with the previous same questionnaire conducted in the United States.Results German hip and spine surgeons demonstrated a surgical order preference paradigm characterized by prioritizing spine-first for spinal disease with neurological deficits (scenario 1, 3, 5), otherwise hip-first preferred without neurological deficits (scenario 2, 4). US surgeons had different patterns of surgical order preference, consistent with German surgeons in some scenarios and not in others. There was also a certain tendency of surgical order preference in different specialists. The surgeons’ preference decision was primarily influenced by the severity and time urgency of symptoms, spine-pelvis-hip biomechanics, and ease and therapeutic effect of hip and spine surgery.Conclusion The sequence of hip and spine surgery in different hip-spine syndrome scenarios has different preference patterns, with professional preferences and cross-nation differences, affected by many factors including disease and treatment regimen."

Genetic variants influencing mean blood cell phenotypes have been used to understand disease aetiology and improve prediction; however, additional information may be captured by genetic effects on observed variance. Here, we mapped variance quantitative trait loci (vQTL), i.e. genetic loci associated with trait variance, for 29 blood cell phenotypes from the UK Biobank (N∼408,111). We discovered 176 independent blood cell vQTLs, of which 147 were not found by additive QTL mapping. vQTLs displayed on average 1.8-fold stronger negative selection than additive QTL, highlighting that selection acts to reduce extreme blood cell phenotypes. Variance polygenic scores (vPGSs) were constructed to stratify individuals in the INTERVAL cohort (N∼40,466), where genetically less variable individuals (low vPGS) had increased conventional PGS accuracy (by ∼19%) than genetically more variable individuals. Genetic prediction of blood cell traits improved by ∼10% on average combining PGS with vPGS. Using Mendelian randomisation and vPGS association analyses, we found that alcohol consumption significantly increased blood cell trait variances highlighting the utility of blood cell vQTLs and vPGSs to provide novel insight into phenotype aetiology as well as improve prediction."

It’s important to train health care professionals on rational use of antimicrobials to curb AMR.Methods This is a prospective interventional study conducted for the clinical practitioners, Undergraduates [MBBS/Interns], Post graduates and Pharmacy Students. A total of 50 participants were included in the study. The innovative games were administered for management of infections of all the different systems of the body in accordance with the ICMR treatment guidelines 2022 and latest IDSA guidelines involving different components. Pre-test and Post-test questionnaires were administered and evaluated.Results After the intervention, the knowledge on differentiating between bacterial and viral symptoms in respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis improved from 48% to 94%. The practice of using right empirical choice of antimicrobials in the right dose for the right duration, based on the severity of the infection improved from 34 % to 82 %. The awareness/practice of using the right and rational combination of antibiotics improved from 44% to 84%. The knowledge on suspecting multi-drug resistant gram negative infections and other priority pathogens such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] and Candida infection improved from 32% to 78%. The practice of using certain antibiotics in specific infection sites based on their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics improved from 20% to 76%. The knowledge on intrinsic resistance of certain microorganisms to specific antimicrobial agents improved from 15 % to 80%.Conclusion The gamified intervention successfully improved participants’ knowledge and awareness on rational antimicrobial use. The substantial improvements in all the aforementioned components highlight the positive impact of the intervention in promoting optimal antimicrobial use and curbing AMR. Innovative gamified interventions create better and long-lasting awareness ensuring the appropriate use of antimicrobials."

Here, we utilize an unconstrained 2-pool quantitative MT (qMT) approach that quantifies the longitudinal relaxation rates  of free water and semi-solids separately, and investigate its sensitivity to amyloid accumulation in preclinical subjects.Methods We recruited 15 cognitively normal subjects, of which nine were amyloid positive by [18F]Florbetaben PET. A 12 min qMT scan was used to estimate the unconstrained 2-pool qMT parameters. Group comparisons and correlations were analyzed at the lobar level.Results The exchange rate and semi-solid pool’s  were sensitive to the amyloid concentration. The former finding is consistent with previous reports in clinical AD, but the latter is novel as its value is typically constrained.Discussion qMT MRI may be a promising surrogate marker of amyloid beta without the need for contrast agents or radiotracers."

However, existing approaches fail to reflect shared genetic architectures. To solve this limitation, we present the Sum of Shared Single Effects (SuShiE) model, which leverages LD heterogeneity to improve fine-mapping precision, infer cross-ancestry effect size correlations, and estimate ancestry-specific expression prediction weights. We apply SuShiE to mRNA expression measured in PBMCs (n=956) and LCLs (n=814) together with plasma protein levels (n=854) from individuals of diverse ancestries in the TOPMed MESA and GENOA studies. We find SuShiE fine-maps cis-molQTLs for 16% more genes compared with baselines while prioritizing fewer variants with greater functional enrichment. SuShiE infers highly consistent cis-molQTL architectures across ancestries on average; however, we also find evidence of heterogeneity at genes with predicted loss-of-function intolerance, suggesting that environmental interactions may partially explain differences in cis-molQTL effect sizes across ancestries. Lastly, we leverage estimated cis-molQTL effect-sizes to perform individual-level TWAS and PWAS on six white blood cell-related traits in AOU Biobank individuals (n=86k), and identify 44 more genes compared with baselines, further highlighting its benefits in identifying genes relevant for complex disease risk. Overall, SuShiE provides new insights into the cis-genetic architecture of molecular traits."

One major clinical need is to accurately predict clinically significant PCa (csPCa). A proteomics based 19-biomarker model (19-BM) was previously developed using Capillary Electrophoresis-Mass Spectrometry (CE-MS) and validated in 1000 patients at risk for PCa. Here, our objective was to validate 19-BM in a multicentre prospective cohort of 101 biopsy-naive patients using current diagnostic pathways.Materials and Methods Urine samples from 101 PCa patients were analysed through CE-MS. All patients underwent MRI using a 3-T system. The 19-BM score was estimated via a support vector machine-based software (MosaCluster; v1.7.0), employing previously established cut-off criterion of -0.07. Previously developed diagnostic nomograms were calculated along with MRI.Results Independent validation of the 19-BM yielded a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 85% (AUC:0.81). This performance surpasses that of PSA (AUC:0.56), and PSA density (AUC:0.69). For PI-RADS≤ 3 patients, the 19-BM showed a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 88%. Integrating the 19-BM with MRI resulted in significantly better accuracy (AUC:0.90) compared to the individual investigations alone (AUC19BM=0.81; p=0.004 and AUCMRI:0.79; p=0.001). Examining the decision curve analysis, the 19-BM with MRI surpassed other approaches for the prevailing risk interval from 30% cut-off.Conclusions 19-BM exhibited favourable reproducibility for prediction of csPCa. In PI-RADS≤3 patients the 19-BM correctly classified 88% of the patients with insignificant PCa at the cost of one csPCa patient that was missed. Utilising 19-BM test could prove valuable complementing MRI and reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies."

We introduce a task-oriented predictive (Top)-BERT architecture, which is a unique end-to-end training and evaluation framework utilizing sequential input structure, embedding layer, and encoder stacks inherent to BERT. This enhanced architecture trains and evaluates the model across multiple learning tasks simultaneously, enhancing the model’s ability to learn from a limited amount of data. Our findings demonstrate that this approach can outperform both traditional pretraining-finetuning BERT models and conventional machine learning methods, offering a promising tool for early identification of patients at risk of diabetes-related complications. We also investigate how different temporal embedding strategies affect the model’s predictive capabilities, with simpler designs yielding better performance. The use of Integrated Gradients (IG) augments the explainability of our predictive models, yielding feature attributions that substantiate the clinical significance of this study. Finally, this study also highlights the essential role of proactive symptom assessment and the management of comorbid conditions in preventing the advancement of complications in patients with diabetes."

This study established the levels of exclusive breastfeeding, alternate feeding patterns, health and growth impacts, among 10 weeks old infants in a remote, understudied village in East Africa.Subject and methods This was a secondary cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort data. Data of 457 out of the 529 mother-newborn pairs recruited from birth were obtained and analysed at 10 weeks post-delivery in the postnatal clinic. Infant feeding patterns were recorded and anthropometry were measured and assessed using NICE criteria for static weight growth. Mothers were interviewed using the Edinburgh postpartum depression score to assess emotional status. Both parametric and non-parametric statistics and binary logistic regression model were applied to examine the relationship between maternal/infant characteristics, feeding patterns and infant weight growth. The results were presented in p-values, Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.Results Clinic attendance had declined below and prevalence of infant weight faltering had increased above the 6 weeks records. The prevalence of infant weight faltering was 3.7% on NICE criteria, higher than the 2.8% with WHO criteria, but there was 93% concordance between the 2 growth assessment tools. Exclusive breastfeeding rate was still high at 96.3%, however, 10.3% of these infants were being breastfed infrequently. The 3 infants that were not exclusively breastfed were offered infant formula (1) using bottle, maize (1) and millet porridge (1) using cup. Infrequent breastfeeding was the major predictor of infant weight faltering, OR 5.59; 95%CI 1.94, 16.14; p=0.001. For every unit increase in frequency of breastfeeding, the infant weight-for-age z-score is likely to increase by 0.15 z-score. To maintain the infant weight z-score at 0 (median), baby should be breastfed on the average of 10times a day consistently. The head circumference and then length were more deficient than the weight in this cohort, despite high level of EBF rate. Maternal depression score was high in the groups of infants that were adequately breastfed and weight thriving, compared to their counterparts.Conclusion Both the practice of EBF and the daily frequency of breastfeeding should be closely monitored; infant head circumference and length assessments should be integrated into the routine growth monitoring programs in these rural MCH clinics. Lactational and mental support programs should be strengthened in the rural MCH systems, to assist mothers to achieve full exclusive breastfeeding easily. The factors contributing to decline in clinic visits need to be identified and mitigated. Home visits should be intensified for infants lost to follow up."

The Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (EYFSP) is a routinely recorded measure of a child’s development completed at the end of their first school year, for all children attending school in England and Wales. Despite widespread use for research and educational purposes, the measurement properties are unknown. This study examined the internal consistency and structural validity of the EYFSP, investigating whether the summed item-level scores, which we refer to as the ‘total score’, can be used as a summary of children’s developmental health. It also examined predictive validity of the total score with respect to later academic attainment and behavioural, social, and emotional difficulties.The data source was the longitudinal prospective birth cohort, Born in Bradford (BiB), and routine education data were obtained from Local Authorities. The internal consistency and structural validity of the EYFSP total score were investigated using Confirmatory Factor Analysis and a Rasch model. Predictive validity was assessed using linear mixed effects models for Key Stage 2 (Maths, Reading, Grammar/Punctuation/Spelling), and behavioural, social, and emotional difficulties (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire).We found that the EYFSP items demonstrated internal consistency, however, an Item Response model suggested weak structural validity (n=10,589). Mixed effects regression found the EYFSP total score to predict later academic outcomes (n=2711), and behavioural, social, and emotional difficulties (n=984). The EYFSP total score appears to be a reasonable measure of child developmental health, due to having internal consistency and predictive validity. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting scores of children with very close to ‘average’ ability levels."

The endpoint is a composite outcome including ischemic stroke or major bleeding or mortality.Results More patients belonged to stage 1 and 2 CKD using the MDRD and CKD-EPI equations. In subgroups of patients with eGFR-MDRD or eGFR-CKD-EPI ≥ 60 mL/min, a 17-18% increase of event was observed in patients with eGFR-CG < 60 mL/min compared to those ≥ 60 mL/min. Compared to no oral anticoagulant (OAC), OAC use was associated with a significantly lower risk of event across stage 1 to 4 CKD but not in stage 5 CKD. Both warfarin and NOACs exhibited better outcome compared to no OAC across stage 1 to 4 CKD while NOACs was associated with more risk reduction compared to warfarin. Among patients on OACs, there was a trend toward better outcome with NOAC than warfarin across stage 2-4 CKD but not in stage 1 and 5 CKD.Conclusions OAC should be used in stage 1 to 4 CKD with NOAC exhibiting the trend of better outcome through stage 2 to 4 CKD than warfarin. For stage 5 CKD, optimal strategy remains undetermined.Clinical PerspectiveWhat Is New? The stages of renal function of AF patients varied significantly with different renal equations, and tthe CG equation remained effective in differentiating clnical outcomes for patients with eGFR-MDRD ≥ 60 mL/min or eGFR-CKD-EPI ≥ 60 mL/minWhat Are the Clinical Implications? OAC should be used in stage 1 to 4 CKD with NOAC exhibiting the trend of better outcome through stage 2 to 4 CKD than warfarin."

However, NTHi can also be found in the upper respiratory tracts of healthy individuals and may not cause any symptoms. The transition of NTHi from a commensal to a pathogenic state is still not well understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the genomic differences between NTHi isolated from healthy children and those with acute or chronic community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to better understand the mechanisms underlying this transition. Genomic differences between NTHi isolated from the nasopharynx swabs of healthy children and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of children with acute or chronic community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were analyzed and compared. The study used bGWAS (Bacterial Genome-Wide Association Study) analysis to identify phenotype convergence genes among the three groups and conducted gene enrichment, antibiotic resistance, and virulence factor analyses. Findings showed heterogeneity in the NTHi genomes among the three groups, and various phenotype transition genes that represent the evolution from a healthy to an acute or chronic clinical phenotype were identified. Multiple pathways were found to be involved in the pathogenicity and chronic adaptation of NTHi, including metabolism, synthetic, mismatch repair, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that antibiotic resistance genes against cephalosporin were commonly present in NTHi isolated from acute and chronic pneumonia patients. Overall, this genomic analysis of NTHi offers promising contributions toward precise clinical diagnosis and treatment.Importance Understanding the transition of Non-typeable Hemophilus Influenzae (NTHi) from a harmless commensal organism to a dangerous pathogen responsible for respiratory infections such as pneumonia in children is crucial for developing more effective diagnostic and treatment strategies. The importance of this study lies in its comprehensive examination of the genomic differences between NTHi strains found in healthy individuals and those causing acute or chronic community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). By employing advanced techniques like bGWAS (Bacterial Genome-Wide Association Study), the research sheds light on the complex genetic underpinnings that facilitate NTHi’s shift towards pathogenicity. Identifying specific genes associated with phenotype transitions, antibiotic resistance, and virulence factors not only deepens our understanding of NTHi’s biology but also paves the way for targeted therapies that could mitigate the impact of this pathogen on public health. Furthermore, the discovery of multiple pathways involved in NTHi’s adaptation to chronic infection states highlights the multifaceted nature of bacterial pathogenesis and underscores the necessity of a nuanced approach to combating these infections. This study’s findings are particularly significant given the growing concern over antibiotic resistance, as evidenced by the prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant genes in strains isolated from pneumonia patients. Thus, this research contributes importantly to the ongoing efforts to refine our approach to diagnosing and treating respiratory infections caused by NTHi, with potential implications for reducing the burden of these diseases on affected populations worldwide."

It occurs when abnormal lung cells multiply out of control and form a tumor in the outer region of the lungs. Adenocarcinoma of the lung is a serious and life-threatening condition that requires effective and timely management to improve the survival and quality of life of the patients. One of the challenges in this cancer treatment is finding the optimal combination of drugs that can target the genes or proteins that are involved in the disease process.Method In this article, we propose a novel method to recommend combinations of trending drugs to target its associated proteins/genes, using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under the RAIN protocol. The RAIN protocol is a three-step framework that consists of: 1) Applying graph neural networks to recommend drug combinations by passing messages between trending drugs for managing disease and genes that act as potential targets for disease; 2) Retrieving relevant articles with clinical trials that include those proposed drugs in previous step using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The search queries include “Adenocarcinoma of the lung”, “Gefitinib”, “Paclitaxel”, “Icotinib” that searched context based in databases using NLP; 3) Analyzing the network meta-analysis to measure the comparative efficacy of the drug combinations.Result We applied our method to a dataset of nodes and edges that represent the network, where each node is a drug or a gene, and each edge is a p-value between them. We found that the graph neural network recommends combining Gefitinib, Paclitaxel, and Icotinib as the most effective drug combination to target this cancer associated proteins/genes. We reviewed the clinical trials and expert opinions on these medications and found that they support our claim. The network meta-analysis also confirmed the effectiveness of these drugs on associated genes.Conclusion Our method is a novel and promising approach to recommend trending drugs combination to target cancer associated proteins/genes, using graph neural networks under the RAIN protocol. It can help clinicians and researchers to find the best treatment options for patients, and also provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of the disease.HighlightsProposing the combination of medicinal compounds together for the treatment of lung adenocarcinomaachieved a p-value of 0.002858 between lung adenocarcinoma and targeted proteins/genes3-Leveraging GraphSAGE for Suggesting an Optimal Drug Combinations.Download figureOpen in new tab"

Patients eligible for the study were undergoing regular hemodialysis for ≥3 months, without residual renal function, and with IDWG (as a percentage of IDWG/dry body weight) ≥2.5%. Treatments were administered at the patient’s home. The primary performance endpoint was differences in weight gain over long interdialytic period with the device compared to the control period. Secondary exploratory endpoints included the need for ultrafiltration (UF) rate > 10 mL/kg/h in the post-interval dialysis.Results Five patients were enrolled into the pilot study (age range 26 to 69 years, 3 women). The hourly mean weight loss from sweat was 186 ± 45 gr/h. The average procedure length was 4.5 hours with an average fluid loss of 899 ± 283 gr per procedure. The average least-squares mean absolute difference between the control and treatment periods was -2.0%; (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.9% to -1.2%, P<0001). The reduction in IDWG was associated a reduction in UF rates, with a least-squares mean difference of -3.2 mL/Kg/min [95% CI -4.6 to -1.8] between the control and treatment periods (P<0.001), resulting in a safe UF rate (<10 mL/Kg/min) in all post-treatment sessions.Conclusion Enhancing sweat rate mitigated IDWG in hemodialysis patients. Together with trice weekly HD, this therapy more closely approximates the capacity of the native kidney to regulate extracellular volume and solute composition, similar to patients with substantial residual kidney function."

Here, we train classification models to predict the first sampled isolates in Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission clusters from demographic and disease data. We find that supervised learning models, in particular balanced random forests, can be used to develop predictive models that discriminate between individuals with TB that are more likely to form transmission clusters and individuals that are likely not to transmit further, with good model performance and AUCs of ≥ 0.75. We also identified the most important patient and disease characteristics in the best performing classification model, including patient demographics, site of infection, TB lineage, and age at diagnosis. This framework can be used to develop predictive tools for the early assessment of a patient’s transmission risk to prioritise individuals for enhanced follow-up with the aim of reducing further transmission."

The classic clinical presentation includes infantile-onset chronic diarrhea, juvenile-onset bilateral cataracts, with development of tendon xanthomas and progressive neurological dysfunction. These multisystem clinical features typically appear in different decades of life often confounding diagnosis of CTX. Further complicating diagnosis is the generally held belief that the clinical presentation of CTX varies highly between individuals and even within families. CTX is a treatable disorder and treatment is most effective when started in the first two decades of life, rendering a particular urgency to diagnosis.In this study we bring a novel approach to detecting genotype phenotype associations in CTX. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify all functional analyses of pathogenic CYP27A1 variants at the level of mRNA, protein and enzyme activity. We identified missense variants that result in complete loss of function (LOF) as well as missense variants that are have some partial function (hypomorphs). Next, we identified every CTX patient in the medical literature whose genotype and clinical phenotype were reported, and binned them according to functional genotype: LOF vs hypomorph. Analysis of these clinical, biochemical and molecular genetics data revealed a clear genotype phenotype association for CTX based on individuals who had two LOF variants vs two hypomorphs. The prevalence of each clinical feature was significantly higher in individuals with two LOF variants for every feature except tendon xanthoma and pyramidal signs. CTX had a detrimental effect on cognition for almost everyone with two LOF variants (96%), while tendon xanthomas were the most common feature in individuals with two hypomorphs (88%). We suspect this is due to ascertainment bias; individuals with a milder form of CTX may not get diagnosed with CTX unless they have this unusual hallmark of the disease. We studied the population genetics of the pathogenic CYP27A1 alleles in gnomAD (N∼800,000). Estimated disease incidence based on carrier frequencies was consistent across the African/African American, Admixed American and European populations (1/308,000). However, no African/African American individuals have been reported in the medical literature as having CTX. Analyses of the pathogenic alleles in each population showed that the frequency of hypomorph pathogenic CYP27A1 alleles was twice as high in African/African Americans (p=3.6E-4) vs Europeans (p=1.2E-4). Conversely, LOF alleles had a lower frequency in African/African Americans than in Europeans, p=6.1E-4 vs p=8.6E-4, respectively. By combining clinical, molecular, functional and populations genetics we uncovered a large health disparity in the diagnosis and treatment of CTX in African Americans and point to the milder clinical presentation of hypomorphs as an underlying component. The results of this study reveal specific opportunities for mitigating this disparity through recognition of the milder form of CTX as a clinical entity that is driven by hypomorph genetic alleles and broad adoption of biochemical testing that utilizes more sensitive biomarkers. Applying the framework and concepts leveraged in this study to the diagnosis of all monogenic disorders will likely result in improved diagnosis and health equity for the rare disease community.Key findingsJoint analysis of clinical, functional, molecular, and population genetic data reveals health disparity in African Americans in a rare monogenic disorder, CTX.The gene that causes CTX, CYP27A1, harbors pathogenic missense variants that are loss of function and other pathogenic missense variants that are hypomorphs.Genotype phenotype analyses based on functional genotype - loss of function vs hypomorph - revealed a phenotype x functional genotype association for CTX.Individuals with loss of function genotype have a significantly more severe clinical presentation than those with a hypomorph genotype.Nearly all individuals with CTX who have a loss of function genotype have detrimental effects to their cognition (96%). The only exceptions to this received treatment with CDCA in the first decade of life.Population genetic analyses estimate that incidence of CTX is consistent across Blacks and Whites but systematic review of the medical literature returned no Black individuals having been reported to have CTX.Hypomorph pathogenic variants in CYP27A1 occur more frequently in African/African Americans (p=3.6E-4) than Europeans (p=1.2E-4). The milder clinical presentation of the hypomorph genotype likely contributes to the under-diagnosis and misdiagnosis of African/African Americans with CTX."

To study whether this reflects a difference in genetic predisposition attributed to autosomal rare variants, we evaluated the sex differences in effect size of damaging protein-truncating and missense variants on autism predisposition in 47,061 autistic individuals, then compared effect sizes between individuals with and without cognitive impairment or motor delay. Although these variants mediated differential likelihood of autism with versus without motor or cognitive impairment, their effect sizes on the liability scale did not differ significantly by sex exome-wide or in genes sex-differentially expressed in the cortex. Although de novo mutations were enriched in genes with male-biased expression in the fetal cortex, the liability they conferred did not differ significantly from other genes with similar loss-of-function intolerance and sex-averaged cortical expression. In summary, autosomal rare coding variants confer similar liability for autism in females and males."

They commonly suffer from malaria, malnutrition, diarrhoea, and respiratory infections, along with mental health issues like depression and PTSD. Severe malnutrition poses significant health risks in the short and long term, especially in developing countries.METHODS To assess IDPs’ health, we conducted interviews. Out of 574 participants aged 10 and above, many reported physical and mental health problems using questionnaires. Additionally, 226 children under five were surveyed for malnutrition using a questionnaire and measurements of mid-upper arm circumference.RESULTS The findings revealed that 45% of IDPs experienced poor physical health, with prevalent ailments among adults including minor colds (67%), respiratory infections (43%), prolonged flu episodes (36%), insomnia (38%), headaches (42%), upset stomachs (44%), nausea (35%), and gastrointestinal issues (40%). Depression, PTSD, and anxiety were prevalent among adults at rates of 18%, 20%, and 14% respectively. Moreover, a staggering 72% of children under five suffered from malnutrition, with males accounting for 44% and females 56%.CONCLUSION In conclusion, the well-being of IDPs residing in camps is detrimentally impacted by the inadequate management, treatment, and prevention of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Government authorities must recognise and address the complexities associated with multiple agencies involved in delivering healthcare services to IDPs. The implementation of efficient systems to monitor, track, and support IDP healthcare could represent a cost-effective strategy to enhance overall health outcomes."

Septic patients with mental health illness may not receive optimal care, being unable to explain symptoms, understand/accept their condition/care, or remain calm. We compare characteristics of ED septic patients with vs without mental health illnesses in their demographics, insurance, housing status, comorbidities, and infected organs, part of a larger, retrospective study seeking to compare such patients’ sepsis care quality (bundle adherence, length-of-stay (LOS)).Methods Patients with sepsis (and their infection source) between 2017-2019 were identified from a health system sepsis reporting database. Their characteristics of history of mental health illness (cognitive, mood, personality, schizophrenia, psychosis, substance use), demographics, insurance, housing status, and comorbidities were obtained via electronic health record query. Such characteristics were compared among patients with vs without mental illness.Results A greater percent of septic patients than the overall U.S. population had a mental illness (26.9% vs 21%). In univariate analysis, patients with mental illnesses were older (77.9 vs 67.6 years), more-likely to be from a psychiatric facility/group home (32.5% vs 2.1%; p<0.0001), have Medicare (58% vs 47.1%; p=0.0201), have ≥1 comorbidity (72.6% vs 0.6%; p<0.0001), and have a respiratory source of sepsis. People without mental illnesses were more-often from either a private home/nursing home (75.2% vs 56.7%; p<0.0001) or clinic (8.9% vs 3.2%; p=0.0191), have private insurance (15.2% vs 7.6%; p=0.0167), and have immune-modifying medications or cancer (20.7% vs 7%; p<0.0001).Discussion Compared with national rates of mental health illness, a higher percent of septic patients (26.9% vs. 21%) had mental illness (mostly neurocognitive). Septic patients with mental illnesses tended to be older, from a psychiatric facility/group home, have Medicare, have ≥1 comorbidity, and have a respiratory source of sepsis. Patients without mental illnesses more-often had immune-modifying medications and malignancy. Patients with mental health illnesses were more-likely to have a respiratory source of their sepsis, perhaps due to higher risk for aspiration or respiratory contagion in group homes/psychiatric facilities. Clinicians may want to specifically test or empirically treat for respiratory sources in this population. Future analyses (multivariate) will determine whether differences in quality of care, mortality, or length of stay exist, and if specific characteristics above were associated with these different outcomes.Limitations The study was based on data from a single hospital system, which might limit generalizability. Additionally, the study relied on data collected for sepsis management, which might not capture all patients with sepsis or those who did not receive the sepsis bundle. Furthermore, all data collected pertaining to this study was only in the timeframe between 2018-2019. The proportion of septic patients with vs. without mental health disorders during and following the COVID pandemic may differ from the earlier time frame represented in this study."

It’s important to create awareness of the rational use of antibiotics to curb AMR.Objective To improve the awareness of the rational use of antibiotics through innovative games for High School Students.Design Prospective interventional studySetting Twelve High Schools in the city of Mysuru, South India.Participants 2195 Students between 13 and 16 years.Intervention Innovative gamified interventions to educate on the rational use of antibiotics. Use of antibiotics only in bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, gut, urinary tract and skin was introduced through black blackboard. An animated video was shown on the effects of irrational antibiotic use. Situations in which antibiotics can be avoided in respiratory infections and gastroenteritis were taught through Bucketing the Ball and Monkeying with Donkey games. Pre-test and Post-test questionnaires were administered and evaluated.Main outcome measures To assess the improvement in awareness of the rational use of antibiotics.Results After the intervention, knowledge of the use of antibiotics only for bacterial infections improved from 11.5% to 82.5% and ill-effects of antibiotics improved from 2.5% to 82.5%. Awareness of when not to use and when to use antibiotics for respiratory infections and gastroenteritis improved from 5.1% to 96.77%, awareness of better use of antibiotics for urinary and skin infections improved from 19.6% to 90.38% and not buying antibiotics directly from the pharmacy without prescription, and completing the antibiotic course improved from 20.3% to 91.92%. p-value < 0.05 for all components.Conclusions Awareness of the rational use of antibiotics is very poor among the general public. The need of the hour is to create awareness not only among healthcare providers but also among the general public. Innovative gamified interventions create better and long-lasting awareness of this.Strength and Limitations of the studyThe strength was using gamified interventions to create knowledge and awareness about rational use of antibiotics.The limitation is, awareness about adverse effects of antibiotics could not be converted to gamified intervention, and it was shown as an animated video since adverse effects of antibiotics include long term complications.Though the students may not be able to remember in the long run the difference between viral and bacterial infections, they will definitely be able to remember that not all respiratory tract infections and gastro enteritis require antibiotics and henceforth they will not pressurize the physicians to prescribe antibiotics."

They arose from the co-evolution of the vertically inherited core genome and horizontal gene transfers by plasmids, which has not been systematically explored.Results We designed KleTy, which consists of dedicated typing schemes for both the core genome and plasmids in Klebsiella. We demonstrated the superior performance of KleTy over many state-of-the-art pipelines using both simulated and real data. We used both schemes to genotype 33,272 Klebsiella genomes, categorising them into 1,773 distinct populations and predicting the presence of 87,410 plasmids from 837 clusters (PCs). Notably, Klebsiella is the center of the plasmid-exchange network within Enterobacteriaceae. Our results associated the international emergence of prevalent Klebsiella populations with only four carbapenem-resistance (CR) PCs, two hypervirulent PCs, and two hvCR-PCs encoding both carbapenemase and hypervirulence. Furthermore, we observed the ongoing international emergence of blaNDM, accompanied by the replacement of the previously dominant population, blaKPC-encoding HC1360_8 (CC258), during 2003-2018, with the emerging blaNDM-encoding HC1360_3 (CC147) thereafter. Additionally, expansions of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvCRKP) were evidenced in both populations, driven by plasmids of MDR-hypervirulence convergences.Conclusions The study illuminates how the global genetic landscape of Klebsiella has been shaped by the co-evolution of both the core genome and the plasmids, underscoring the importance of surveillance and control of the dissemination of plasmids for curtailing the emergence of hvCRKPs."

The model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, monitors the temporal dynamics of the disease, as well as changes in viral RNA concentration in the county’s wastewater system (which consists of three sewage treatment plants). The model was calibrated using the wastewater data during the third wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Miami-Dade (specifically, the time period from July 3, 2021 to October 9, 2021). The calibrated model was used to predict SARS-CoV-2 case and hospitalization trends in the county during the aforementioned time period, showing a strong correlation (with a correlation coefficient r = 0.99) between the observed (detected) weekly case data and the corresponding weekly data predicted by the calibrated model. The model’s prediction of the week when maximum number of SARS-CoV-2 cases will be recorded in the county during the simulation period precisely matches the time when the maximum observed/reported cases were recorded (which was August 14, 2021). Furthermore, the model’s projection of the maximum number of cases for the week of August 14, 2021 is about 15 times higher than the maximum observed weekly case count for the county on that day (i.e., the maximum case count estimated by the model was 15 times higher than the actual/observed count for confirmed cases). This result is consistent with the result of numerous SARS-CoV-2 modeling studies (including other wastewater-based modeling, as well as statistical models) in the literature. Furthermore, the model accurately predicts a one-week lag between the peak in weekly COVID-19 case and hospitalization data during the time period of the study in Miami-Dade, with the model-predicted hospitalizations peaking on August 21, 2021. Detailed time-varying global sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the parameters (wastewater-based, epidemiological and biological) that have the most influence on the chosen response function - the cumulative viral load in the wastewater. This analysis revealed that the transmission rate of infectious individuals, shedding rate of infectious individuals, recovery rate of infectious individuals, average fecal load per person per unit time and the proportion of shed viral RNA that is not lost in sewage before measurement at the wastewater treatment plant were most influential to the response function during the entire time period of the study. This study shows, conclusively, that wastewater surveillance data can be a very powerful indicator for measuring (i.e., providing early-warning signal and current burden) and predicting the future trajectory and burden (e.g., number of cases and hospitalizations) of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS-CoV-2, in a community."

Here, we decipher the expression and function of SH3D21 in human hepatocellular carcinoma. The expression level and clinical significance of SH3D21 in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, the relationship between SH3D21 and the features of tumor microenvironment (TME) and role of SH3D21 in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma progression were analyzed based on the bulk samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases. Single-cell sequencing samples from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were employed to verify the prediction mechanism. Additionally, different biological effects of SH3D21 on hepatocellular carcinoma cells were investigated by qRT-PCR, CCK-8 assay, colony forming assay and Western blot analysis. Bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments revealed that the expression level of SH3D21 was up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and correlated with the poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. SH3D21 effectively promoted the proliferation, invasion, and migration as well as the formation of immunosuppressive microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, SH3D21 can activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. SH3D21 stimulates the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and SH3D21 can serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma."

However, no large-scale studies have been conducted in Mexico or Latin America examining these associations.METHODS We analyzed data from 115,919 adults without diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed) aged 35-84 years who participated in the Mexico City Prospective Study between 1998 and 2004. Participants were followed until January 1st, 2021 for cause-specific mortality. We defined prediabetes according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA, HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4%) and the International Expert Committee (IEC, HbA1c 6.0-6.4%) definitions. Cox regression adjusted for confounders was used to estimate all-cause and cause-specific mortality rate ratios (RR) at ages 35-74 years associated with prediabetes.FINDINGS During 2,085,392 person-years of follow-up (median in survivors 19 years), there were 6,810 deaths at ages 35-74, including 1,742 from cardiovascular disease, 892 from renal disease and 108 from acute diabetic crises. Of 110,405 participants aged 35-74 years at recruitment, 28,852 (26%) had ADA-defined prediabetes and 7,203 (7%) had IEC-defined prediabetes. Compared with those without prediabetes, individuals with prediabetes had higher risk of all-cause mortality at ages 35-74 years (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.19 for ADA-defined prediabetes and RR 1.28, 1.18-1.39 for IEC-defined prediabetes), as well as increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.22 [1.10-1.35] and 1.42 [1.22-1.65], respectively), renal mortality (RR 1.35 [1.08-1.68] and 1.69 [1.24-2.31], respectively), and death from an acute diabetic crisis (RR 2.63 [1.76-3.94] and 3.43 [2.09-5.62], respectively). RRs were larger at younger than at older ages, and similar for men compared to women. The absolute excess risk associated with ADA and IEC-defined prediabetes at ages 35-74 accounted for6% and 3% of cardiovascular deaths respectively, 10% and 5% of renal deaths respectively, and 31% and 14% of acute diabetic deaths respectively.INTERPRETATION Prediabetes is a significant risk factor for all-cause, cardiovascular, renal, and acute diabetic deaths in Mexican adults. Identification and timely management of individuals with prediabetes for targeted risk reduction could contribute to reducing premature mortality from cardiometabolic causes in this population.FUNDING Wellcome Trust, the Mexican Health Ministry, the National Council of Science and Technology for Mexico, Cancer Research UK, British Heart Foundation, UK Medical Research Council. Instituto Nacional de Geriatría (Mexico City).Evidence before this study We conducted a literature search in PubMed to identify articles published in English before February 27th, 2024 that reported on prospective studies examining the association between prediabetes with all-cause or cause-specific mortality or progression to diabetes in a Mexican or Latin American population, using the terms (“prediabetes” OR “impaired fasting glucose” OR “impaired glucose tolerance”) AND (“mortality” OR “death”) AND (“Mexico” OR “Mexican” OR “Latin America” OR “Latin American”). There were no studies examining risk associated with prediabetes definitions and mortality among adults in Mexico. We identified one study from Peru that included 988 participants and investigated only all-cause mortality for impaired fasting glucose and HbA1c-based definitions of prediabetes from ADA and IEC; this study reported increased mortality risk related to ADA-defined prediabetes based on HbA1c measures. Generalizability of these findings to other Latin American countries and regions with distinct cardiometabolic profiles in unclear.Added value of this study Our study included 115,919 participants without diabetes from Mexico City, of whom (26%) had ADA-defined prediabetes and 7,203 (7%) had IEC-defined prediabetes. We found that prediabetes is associated with higher risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular, renal, and acute diabetic causes) than among participants without prediabetes. We found RRs to be larger at younger than at older ages, and largely similar for men compared to women. Among those without previously diagnosed diabetes, we found that the excess risk associated with ADA- and IEC-defined prediabetes at ages 35-74 years accounted for 6% and 3% of cardiovascular deaths, 10% and 5% of renal deaths, and 31% and 14% of acute diabetic deaths, respectively. .Implications of all the available evidence Our results show that prediabetes is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular, kidney, and acute diabetic deaths among Mexican adults and accounts for a notable fraction of such deaths. Identification of individuals with prediabetes should be prioritized for optimized management to improve cardiometabolic outcomes in Mexican adults."

Our understanding of the mechanisms by which indirect genetic effects operate is limited. Here, we hypothesize that one mechanism is via the offspring methylome. To test this hypothesis polygenic scores (PGSs) for schizophrenia, smoking initiation, educational attainment (EA), social deprivation, body mass index (BMI), and height were analyzed in a cohort of 1,528 offspring and their parents (51.5% boys, mean [SD] age = 10 [2.8] years). We modelled parent and offspring PGSs on offspring DNA methylation, accounting for the own PGS of offspring, and found significant associations between parental PGSs for schizophrenia, EA, BMI, and height, and offspring methylation sites, comprising 16, 2, 1, and 6 sites, respectively (alpha = 2.7 × 10−5). More DNA methylation sites were associated with maternal than paternal PGSs, possibly reflecting the maternal pre- or periconceptional environment during critical embryonic development."

Here we employed the massively parallel reporter assay ChIP-STARR-seq to functionally annotate activity of >140 thousand non-coding regulatory elements (NCREs) in human neural stem cells (NSCs) as a model for early brain development. Highly active NCREs show an increasing sequence constraint and harbour de novo variants in individuals affected by neurodevelopmental disorders. They are enriched for transcription factor (TF) motifs including YY1 and p53 family members and for the presence of primate-specific transposable elements, providing insights on gene regulatory mechanisms in NSCs. Examining episomal NCRE activity of the same sequences in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) identified cell type differential activity and primed NCREs, accompanied by a rewiring of the epigenome landscape. Leveraging on the experimentally measured NCRE activity and nucleotide composition of the assessed sequences, we build BRAIN-MAGNET, a convolutional neural network that allows the prediction of NCRE activity based on DNA sequence composition, and which identifies functionally relevant nucleotides and TF motifs within each NCRE that are required for NCRE function. The application of BRAIN-MAGNET including its functional validation allows fine-mapping of GWAS loci identified for common neurological traits, and prioritization of possible disease causing rare non-coding variants in currently genetically unexplained individuals with neurogenetic disorders, including those from the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes project. We foresee that this NCRE atlas and BRAIN-MAGNET will help reducing missing heritability in human genetics, by limiting the search space for functional relevant non-coding genetic variation.

However, the role of de novo retroelements (DNRTs) in birth defects and childhood cancers has not been well characterized due to the lack of adequate data and efficient computational tools. Here, we examine whole-genome sequencing data of 3,244 trios from 12 birth defect and childhood cancer cohorts in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program. Using an improved version of our tool xTea (x-Transposable element analyzer) that incorporates a deep-learning module, we identified 162 DNRTs, as well as 2 pseudogene insertions. Several variants are likely to be causal, such as a de novo Alu insertion that led to the ablation of a whole exon in the NF1 gene in a proband with brain tumor. We observe a high de novo SVA insertion burden in both high-intolerance loss-of-function genes and exons as well as more frequent de novo Alu insertions of paternal origin. We also identify potential mosaic DNRTs from embryonic stages. Our study reveals the important roles of DNRTs in causing birth defects and predisposition to childhood cancers."

The updated model is called MANC-RISK-SCREEN and assumes a life-time horizon, the UK health service perspective to identify costs (using £; 2022) and measures health consequences using life-years and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The original data sources used for the Gray-model were assessed for current relevance and updated where feasible. Updated data sources included: cancer and all-cause mortality; breast cancer incidence; breast cancer risk data; tumour staging; recall rate; mammographic sensitivity by breast density group; costs; and utilities. Model parameter uncertainty was assessed using Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA) and one-way sensitivity analysis.Results The base case analysis, supported by PSA, suggested that there was always a risk-stratified approach to breast cancer screening that was superior to universal screening. In the base case analysis, a strategy of dividing women into three equal groups based on risk was the most cost-effective. In the PSA, a strategy based on that used in the BC-PREDICT study was the most cost-effective. There was uncertainty in whether the addition of reduced screening for women at lower risk was cost-effective.Conclusion The results of this study suggest that risk-stratified approaches to breast cancer screening are more cost-effective than both 3-yearly and 2-yearly universal screening.HighlightsA published early decision-analytic model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, using discrete event simulation (the ‘Gray model’), produced indicative results suggesting all included exemplars of a stratified national breast screening programme (stratified-NBSP) were cost-effective compared with no screening but a fully incremental analysis indicated only risk-based stratified-NBSP were cost-effective.This study uses a subsequently validated version of the Gray-model to produce a cost-effectiveness analysis with an updated model called MANC-RISK-SCREEN using revised descriptions of the relevant stratified-NBSP and new values for cancer and all-cause mortality; breast cancer incidence; breast cancer risk data; tumour staging; recall rate; mammographic sensitivity by breast density group; costs; and utilities.This analysis builds on the indicative estimates of the healthcare costs and health consequences of stratified-NBSP and suggests, with the current level of evidence, they are a cost-effective use of the NHS budget in the United Kingdom but uncertainty remains in the value of reducing screening for those at lower risk."

However, it remains uncertain whether these children are predisposed to both conditions or if early-life RIs induce alterations in airway function, immune responses, or other human biology that contribute to the development of asthma. Puerto Rican children experience a disproportionate burden of early-life RIs and asthma, making them an important population for investigating this complex interplay. PRIMERO, the Puerto Rican Infant Metagenomics and Epidemiologic Study of Respiratory Outcomes, recruited pregnant women and their newborns to investigate how the airways develop in early life among infants exposed to different viral RIs, and will thus provide a critical understanding of childhood asthma development. As the first asthma birth cohort in Puerto Rico, PRIMERO will prospectively follow 2,100 term healthy infants. Collected samples include post-term maternal peripheral blood, infant cord blood, the child’s peripheral blood at the year two visit, and the child’s nasal airway epithelium, collected using minimally invasive nasal swabs, at birth, during RIs over the first two years of life, and at annual healthy visits until age five. Herein, we describe the study’s design, population, recruitment strategy, study visits and procedures, and primary outcomes."

This study aims to assess the association between adherence to antihypertensive medications and total medical costs, health care utilization, and productivity-related outcomes.Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using MarketScan databases, which included individuals aged 18–64 with non-capitated health insurance plans in 2019. Adherence was defined as ≥80% Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) for prescribed antihypertensive medications. We used a generalized linear model to estimate total medical costs, a negative binomial model to estimate health care utilization (emergency department visits and inpatient admissions), an exponential hurdle model to estimate productivity-related outcomes (number of sick absences, short-term disability [STD], long-term disability [LTD]), and a two-part model to estimate productivity-related costs in 2019 U.S. dollars. All models were adjusted for age, sex, urbanicity, census region, and comorbidities. We reported average marginal effects for outcomes related to antihypertensive medication adherence.Results Among 379,503 individuals with hypertension in 2019, 54.4% adhered to antihypertensives. Per-person, antihypertensive medication adherence was associated with $1,441 lower total medical costs, $11 lower sick absence costs, $291 lower STD costs, and $69 lower LTD costs. Per 1,000 individuals, medication adherence was associated with lower healthcare utilization, including 200 fewer ED visits and 90 fewer inpatient admissions, and productivity-related outcomes, including 20 fewer sick absence days and 442 fewer STD days.Conclusions Adherence to antihypertensives was consistently associated with lower total medical costs, reduced healthcare utilization, and improved productivity-related outcomes."

Generation of mucosal immune responses, including mucosal IgA, could be of potential benefit to vaccine efficacy, yet limited evidence exists regarding the production of mucosal antibodies following the administration of current mRNA vaccines to young children.Methods We measured the levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from a cohort of children under 5 years of age undergoing SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination (serially collected, matched serum and saliva samples, N=116) or on convenience samples of children under 5 years of age presenting to a pediatric emergency department (nasal swabs, N=103). Further, we assessed salivary and nasal samples for the ability to induce SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation.Results Longitudinal analysis of post-vaccine responses in saliva revealed the induction of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG but not IgA. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA was only observed in nasal samples obtained from previously infected children with or without vaccination, but not in vaccinated children without a history of infection. In addition, oronasopharyngeal samples obtained from children with prior infection were able to trigger enhanced spike-mediated NET formation, and IgA played a key role in driving this process.Conclusions Despite the induction of specific IgG in the oronasal mucosa, current intramuscular vaccines have limited ability to generate mucosal IgA in young children. These results confirm the independence of mucosal IgA responses from systemic humoral responses following mRNA vaccination and suggest potential future vaccination strategies for enhancing mucosal protection in this young age group."

This study also provides valuable insight into two at-risk populations: infants and children (age 0-4) and older adults (age 65 and over).Methods Using a subset of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from Truveta, a growing collective of health systems that provide more than 18% of all daily clinical care in the US, we identified people who were hospitalized between October 01, 2019 and March 31, 2024. We identified people who tested positive for any of the six respiratory viruses within 14 days of the hospitalization. We report weekly trends in the rate of hospitalizations associated with each virus per all hospitalizations for the overall population and the two high-risk sub populations: infants and children and older adults.Results We included 497,047 hospitalizations of 461,039 unique patients who tested positive for a respiratory virus between October 01, 2019 and March 31, 2024.Overall, the rate of hospitalizations associated with respiratory viruses has decreased throughout March 2024 (-32.4%) compared to February 2024.

The extent to which dietary modification can contribute to disease prevention and treatment however remains unclear. Here, we addressed the effects of a dietary pattern, involving periodic animal product restriction (APR), on markers of human health. We compared blood biomarkers, complete blood counts, anthropometric traits and blood pressure between two dietary states for a unique group of 200 individuals from Greece, who alternate between omnivory and APR, for religious reasons. We used linear mixed effects models to report changes in measured traits between dietary states. Short-term APR was linked to a reduction in levels of total and LDL cholesterol [both β=-0.3, p<0.0001], to a 72% decrease in CRP concentration [β=-1.3, p=0.001], to reduced platelet counts [β=-9.8, p<0.0001] and to a concurrent reduction in CVD risk (5.3% to 4.9%, p=0.02), shifting APR-practicing individuals from a high to a low-to-moderate risk group. Beneficial changes were recorded for markers of renal and liver function, with the exception of ALP [β=2.5, p<0.0001]. These changes were not detected in a control group of 211 continuously omnivorous individuals. Overall, short-term APR was linked to a biomarker profile associated with positive effects on health, suggesting that even modest dietary modifications can be harnessed towards disease prevention."

Poorer midlife cognitive function is associated with increased dementia and stroke risk. The mechanisms underlying variation in cognitive function are uncertain. Here, we assessed associations between 1160 proteins’ plasma levels and two measures of cognitive function, the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in 1198 PURE-MIND participants. We identified five DSST performance-associated proteins (NCAN, BCAN, CA14, MOG, CDCP1), with NCAN and CDCP1 showing replicated association in an independent cohort, GS (N=1053). MRI-assessed structural brain phenotypes partially mediated (8-19%) associations between NCAN, BCAN, and MOG, and DSST performance. Mendelian randomisation analyses suggested higher CA14 levels might cause larger hippocampal volume and increased stroke risk, whilst higher CDCP1 levels might increase intracranial aneurysm risk.

It built on an existing underutilised database of people after brain injury and their carers who were interested in engaging with PPI and utilised video-calling software. It was led by a Brain injury Survivor acting as Facilitator with admin support from the MedTech Cooperative.Results To date 14 PPI sessions were completed supporting a total of 17 projects. The diversity of the panel members was comparable to that of the population at large. However, further work is needed, especially in engaging people experiencing homelessness, people living outside of England and those with communication impairments. Feedback from researchers was positive and specific impacts are stated.Conclusion Through the leadership of a facilitator who has an understanding of the lived experience of brain injury a PPI programme has been developed.

Olfactory dysfunction can therefore lead to changes in various aspects of eating behavior, such as food choice, appetite, and food intake. In light of the increasing prevalence of persistent olfactory dysfunction among patients affected by Covid-19, providing proper care and dietary advice to individuals with olfactory dysfunction is imperative. Therefore, this scoping review seeks to gain a better understanding of the impact of olfactory dysfunction on eating behavior. Following the PRISMA guidelines, 49 papers were included, the outcomes were presented by dividing them into two categories: 1) anticipatory eating behavior, including (anticipatory) food liking, appetite and craving, food preferences, food neophobia, and cooking habits; and 2) consummatory behavior, including, food intake, consumption frequency, adherence to dietary guidelines, (experienced) food liking, food enjoyment, and eating habits. Our results show that in the anticipatory phase of eating behavior, food liking and, food preferences and in the consummatory phase, food enjoyment is most affected in people who experienced a sudden change in olfactory function rather than a gradual decline. Moreover, changes in food flavor perception due to olfactory dysfunction, result in a shift of food preferences towards more taste-based preferences, such as salty or savory (i.e., umami) foods. Subsequently, changes in preferences can affect food intake and adherence to dietary guidelines, but only to a limited extent. Appetite is more likely to be low in individuals with short-term olfactory dysfunction compared to those with long-term changes. Generally, eating behavior is more impacted in individuals with a distorted sense of smell than in those with smell loss, and the effect becomes more pronounced over time. Due to the heterogeneity of methods used to measure different aspects of eating behavior, this review stresses the importance of more research on olfaction and eating behavior using standardized and validated assessments. Such research is essential to better understand the effects of olfactory dysfunction on each aspect of eating behavior and provide effective interventions.HighlightsFood liking, preferences, and enjoyment are the most affected by olfactory dysfunctionImpact on eating behavior is more pronounced in qualitative vs. quantitative smell lossEffects of olfactory dysfunction vary by duration and nature (qualitative vs. quantitative)Standardized, validated methods are needed to assess eating behavior in future studiesThere is a crucial need for effective interventions to enhance the eating experienceDownload figureOpen in new tab"

First, we empirically establish the existence and the causes of bias, specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. After that we investigate theoretically the effects of bias on well-being. In order to do this, we present a behavioral-epidemiological differential equation model derived from an agent-based model that combines rational choice behavior with infectious disease dynamics. In addition the model is evaluated normatively by an axiomatically characterized model of an ethical, impartial, eudaimonistic and individualist observer. These assumptions imply a new proof for the utilitarian principle. The result is that while increased fear improves purely epidemiological outcomes, the social welfare outcome shows mixed results; which shows that it is not enough to take only epidemiological measures into account when generating policy recommendations. Finally, we draw some practical consequences from the model, and point to some ethical considerations in modeling the interaction of policy making and public perception."

This study aims to validate Echo-Particle Image Velocimetry (echoPIV) for in-vivo left ventricular intracardiac flow imaging against 4D flow MRI.Methods and Results We acquired HFR contrast-enhanced ultrasound images from three standard apical views of 26 patients who required cardiac MRI. 4D flow MRI was obtained for each patient. Only echo image planes with sufficient quality and alignment with MRI were included for validation. Regional velocity, kinetic energy and viscous energy loss were compared between modalities using normalized mean absolute error, cosine similarity and Bland-Altman analysis.Among 24 included apical view acquisitions, we observed good correspondence between echoPIV and MRI regarding spatial flow patterns and vortex traces. The velocity profile at base-level (mitral valve) cross-section had cosine similarity of 0.92 ± 0.06 and normalized mean absolute error of 14 ± 5%. Peak spatial mean velocity differed by 3 ± 6 cm/s in systole and 6 ± 10 cm/s in diastole. The kinetic energy and rate of energy loss also revealed a high level of cosine similarity (0.89 ± 0.09 and 0.91 ± 0.06) with normalized mean absolute error of 23 ± 7% and 52 ± 16%.Conclusions Given good B-mode image quality, echoPIV provides a reliable estimation of left ventricular flow, exhibiting spatial-temporal velocity distributions comparable to 4D flow MRI. Both modalities present respective strengths and limitations: echoPIV captured inter-beat variability and had higher temporal resolution, while MRI was more robust to patient BMI and anatomy."

However, developing such models for rare diseases presents challenges due to the scarcity of affected patients for developing and calibrating models. Methods that pool information from multiple sources can help with these challenges.Methods We compared three approaches for developing clinical prediction models for population-screening based on an example of discriminating a rare form of diabetes (Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young - MODY) in insulin-treated patients from the more common Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Two datasets were used: a case-control dataset (278 T1D, 177 MODY) and a population-representative dataset (1418 patients, 96 MODY tested with biomarker testing, 7 MODY positive). To build a population-level prediction model, we compared three methods for recalibrating models developed in case-control data. These were prevalence adjustment (“offset”), shrinkage recalibration in the population-level dataset (“recalibration”), and a refitting of the model to the population-level dataset (“re-estimation”). We then developed a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model combining shrinkage recalibration with additional informative biomarker information only available in the population-representative dataset. We developed prior information from the literature and other data sources to deal with missing biomarker and outcome information and to ensure the clinical validity of predictions for certain biomarker combinations.Results The offset, re-estimation, and recalibration methods showed good calibration in the population-representative dataset. The offset and recalibration methods displayed the lowest predictive uncertainty due to borrowing information from the fitted case-control model. We demonstrate the potential of a mixture model for incorporating informative biomarkers, which significantly enhanced the model’s predictive accuracy, reduced uncertainty, and showed higher stability in all ranges of predictive outcome probabilities.Conclusion We have compared several approaches that could be used to develop prediction models for rare diseases. Our findings highlight the recalibration mixture model as the optimal strategy if a population-level dataset is available. This approach offers the flexibility to incorporate additional predictors and informed prior probabilities, contributing to enhanced prediction accuracy for rare diseases. It also allows predictions without these additional tests, providing additional information on whether a patient should undergo further biomarker testing before genetic testing."

Grit was measured using an 8-item short grit scale. Multidimensional eating behaviors were measured using the Japanese version of the 21-item Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R21, comprising uncontrolled eating, emotional eating, and cognitive restraint. Obesity was defined as a body mass index ≥25.0 kg/m2, which is the World Health Organization’s cutoff specific to Asian populations in the Asia-Pacific region. A series of logistic regression models were created to analyze the association between grit and obesity with and without eating behaviors. Mediation analyses using the Karlson Holm Breen method were performed to determine whether eating behavior mediated this association.Results Of the 1641 adults, 26.8% were obese. A higher grit level was associated with a lower likelihood of obesity, less uncontrolled and emotional eating, and higher cognitive restraint. Uncontrolled and emotional eating fully mediated the association between grit and obesity, whereas cognitive restraint only partially mediated this association.Conclusions The inverse association between grit and obesity was mediated by multidimensional eating behaviors. Identifying impairments in eating behaviors, rather than focusing on an individual’s lack of willpower, may contribute to dispelling the aforementioned stigma and facilitating a dialogue for the prevention and management of obesity."

In a retrospective case-control study, we developed a precision phenotyping algorithm for identifying research cohorts of PASC patients, defined as a diagnosis of exclusion. We used longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data from over 295 thousand patients from 14 hospitals and 20 community health centers in Massachusetts. The algorithm employs an attention mechanism to exclude sequelae that prior conditions can explain. We performed independent chart reviews to tune and validate our precision phenotyping algorithm. Our PASC phenotyping algorithm improves precision and prevalence estimation and reduces bias in identifying Long COVID patients compared to the U09.9 diagnosis code. Our algorithm identified a PASC research cohort of over 24 thousand patients (compared to about 6 thousand when using the U09.9 diagnosis code), with a 79.9 percent precision (compared to 77.8 percent from the U09.9 diagnosis code). Our estimated prevalence of PASC was 22.8 percent, which is close to the national estimates for the region. We also provide an in-depth analysis outlining the clinical attributes, encompassing identified lingering effects by organ, comorbidity profiles, and temporal differences in the risk of PASC. The PASC phenotyping method presented in this study boasts superior precision, accurately gauges the prevalence of PASC without underestimating it, and exhibits less bias in pinpointing Long COVID patients. The PASC cohort derived from our algorithm will serve as a springboard for delving into Long COVID’s genetic, metabolomic, and clinical intricacies, surmounting the constraints of recent PASC cohort studies, which were hampered by their limited size and available outcome data."

This study leverages independent patient cohorts in Florence and Liège gathered under the umbrella of the DRAGON consortium for the stratification of molecular phenotypes associated with COVID-19 using topological analysis of global blood gene expression. Whole blood from 173 patients was collected and RNA was sequenced on the Novaseq platform. Molecular phenotypes were defined through topological analysis of gene expression relative to the biological network using the TopMD algorithm. The two cohorts from Florence and Liège allowed for independent validation of the findings in this study. Clustering of the topological maps of differential pathway activation revealed three distinct molecular phenotypes of COVID-19 in the Florence patient cohort, which were also observed in the Liège cohort.Cluster 1 was characterised by high activation of pathways associated with ESC pluripotency, NRF2, and TGF-β receptor signalling. Cluster 2 displayed high activation of pathways including focal adhesion-PI3K-Akt-mTOR signalling and type I interferon induction and signalling, while Cluster 3 exhibited low IRF7-related pathway activation. TopMD was also used with the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb), revealing pharmaceutical interventions targeting mechanisms across multiple phenotypes and individuals.The data illustrates the utility of molecular phenotyping from topological analysis of blood gene expression, and holds promise for informing personalised therapeutic strategies not only for COVID-19 but also for Disease X. Its potential transferability across multiple diseases highlights the value in pandemic response efforts, offering insights before large-scale clinical studies are initiated."

However, financial and infrastructure requirements for whole genome sequencing (WGS) mean most surveillance data have come from higher-resource geographies, despite unprecedented investment in sequencing in low-middle income countries (LMICs) throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Consequently, the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in some LMICs is limited, and there is a need for more cost-accessible technologies to help close data gaps for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants. To address this, we have developed two high-resolution melt curve (HRM) assays that target key variant-defining mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which give unique signature profiles that define different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). Extracted RNA from SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected from 205 participants (112 in Burkina Faso, 93 in Kenya) on the day of enrolment in the MALCOV study (Malaria as a Risk Factor for COVID-19) between February 2021 and February 2022 were analysed using our optimised HRM assays and compared to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on Oxford Nanopore MinION . With NGS as a reference, two HRM assays, HRM-VOC-1 and HRM-VOC-2, demonstrated sensitivity/specificity of 100%/99.29% and 92.86/99.39%, respectively, for detecting Alpha, 90.08%/100% and 92.31%/100% for Delta and 93.75%/100% and 100%/99.38% for Omicron. The assays described here provide a lower-cost approach (<$1 per sample) to conducting molecular epidemiology, capable of high-throughput testing. We successfully scaled up the HRM-VOC-2 assay to screen a total of 506 samples from which we were able to show the replacement of Alpha with the introduction of Delta and the replacement of Delta by the Omicron variant in this community in Kisumu, Kenya. These assays are readily adaptable and can focus on local epidemiological surveillance questions or be updated quickly to accommodate the emergence of a novel variant or adapt to novel and emerging pathogens."

Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial for prompt and appropriate treatment as well as surveillance efforts, and the use of plasma biomarkers offers important advantages over parasitological examination of urine, including increased sensitivity and the possibility to use the same specimen for multiple investigations.The present study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of different plasma biomarkers in endemic populations from Burkina Faso, West Africa. Schistosoma spp. Circulating Anodic Antigen (CAA), cell free S. haematobium DNA (cfDNA), class M and G antibodies against S. haematobium Soluble Worm Antigen Preparation (SWAP) and Soluble Egg Antigen (SEA) were measured in 406 plasma samples. Results of each biomarker test were compared to those of CAA, a Composite Reference Standard (CRS) and Latent Class Analysis (LCA).An identical proportion of positive samples (29%) was observed as a result of CAA and cfDNA testing, with a substantial agreement (84%, Cohen k=0.62) between the results of the two tests, and a comparable agreement with the results of CRS and LCA. A higher positivity was observed, as expected, as a result of specific antibody testing (47%-72%), with IgG showing a higher agreement than IgM with the three references. Also, higher IgG levels were observed in current vs past infection, and ROC analysis identified optimal cutoff values for improved testing accuracy.This study provides compelling evidence that can inform the choice of the most appropriate diagnostic plasma biomarker for urogenital schistosomiasis in endemic areas, depending on the purpose, context, and available resources for testing. Either CAA or cfDNA testing can be used for the diagnosis of patients and for epidemiological investigations, even in absence of urine filtration microscopy, whereas anti-SWAP or anti-SEA IgG can be employed for surveillance and integrated monitoring of control interventions against poverty-associated diseases.Author summary Urogenital schistosomiasis is a chronic debilitating disease affecting populations living in Africa and the Middle East and showing a strong association with poverty. Accurate detection of infection is important both for disease treatment and surveillance. Several tests based on detection in plasma of parasite protein (CAA), parasite DNA or parasite-specific host antibodies (IgM and IgG against SWAP and SEA antigens) are available and this study aims at comparing them to evaluate their accuracy. The comparison showed that tests based on parasite CAA or DNA yield very similar results and therefore the test of choice for diagnosis or epidemiological investigations can be based on laboratory resources. Additionally, the comparison showed that IgG against SWAP and SEA outperform IgM, and that high accuracy can be achieved by identifying an optimal level to determine positivity (cut-off), making these antibody tests ideal for surveillance purposes."

Socioeconomic status, demographic factors, clinical parameters, and regional disparities have been associated with patterns of HIVDR across SSA. Understanding the interplay of these factors is crucial for designing effective interventions to mitigate the impact of HIVDR and improve treatment outcomes in the region.Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of the Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) HIV drug resistance datasets from Cameroon, Malawi, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. All recipients of care aged between 15+ years were included in this analysis. The outcome of interest was whether a person had HIVDR resistant strains or no HIVDR resistant strains. Predictive analysis, chi-square test, univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted in R. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.Results The total sample size across the nine countries was 1008. Tanzania had the highest representation (16.8%), followed by Zambia (16.3%) and Zimbabwe (14.2% while Rwanda had the lowest representation (5.1%). Significant associations were observed between ARV status, viral suppression, country of residence and HIVDR in SSA. Individuals residing in Rwanda had significantly higher odds of HIVDR (adjusted OR = 3.63, 95% CI: 1.22-11.0, p = 0.021) compared to other countries. Additionally, individuals with suppressed viral loads had significantly lower odds of HIVDR (adjusted OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.21-0.45, p < 0.001), while those on ART exhibited higher odds of HIVDR (adjusted OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.75-3.91, p < 0.001).Conclusion This study focused on how clinical and sociodemographic factors influence HIVDR patterns in SSA. To mitigate the effects of HIVDR and improve treatment outcomes in the region, it is critical to address barriers to treatment access and adherence and upgrade the healthcare system."

However, traditional measures have limitations, including susceptibility to non-glycemic factors. To address these limitations, there is a growing need for personalized metrics of glycemic control that take into account individual variability and provide a more comprehensive assessment of glycemic response.Objective To develop the Individualized Glycemic Index (IGI) as a new marker of glycemic control. Methods: A simulated dataset representing individuals with varied glycemic profiles, including fasting glucose levels, glycemic variability measures, glycemic response to foods, HbA1c, fructosamine, and other relevant factors, was created. An algorithm was implemented in the Python language using designated libraries. We evaluated: the algorithm’s performance using simulated data with known glycemic control outcomes; the algorithm’s ability to accurately predict glycemic control based on the provided data; the algorithm’s performance with glycemic control analyses.Results The IGI algorithm uses a comprehensive set of input data to provide a personalized assessment of glycemic control. A program in Python language was developed to calculate the IGI, with a comprehensive metric for evaluating glycemic control. The structured algorithm incorporated the most relevant factors to create a program taking into account each patient’s individuality.Conclusion The IGI provides a more comprehensive and personalized assessment of glycemic control, which may improve diabetes management and outcomes, becoming a promising marker of glycemic control that surpasses the limitations of traditional measures."

We aimed to describe associations between activation of a paediatric patient portal and patient race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status and markers of previous engagement with health care.Methods A retrospective single site cross-sectional study was undertaken to examine patient portal adoption amongst families of children receiving care for chronic or complex disorders within the United Kingdom. Descriptive and multivariable regression analysis was undertaken to describe associations between predictors (Race/Ethnicity, age, socio-economic deprivation status based on family residence, and previous non-attendance to outpatient consultations) and outcome.Results A sample of 3687 children, representative of the diverse ‘real world’ patient population, was identified. Of these 37% (1364) were from a White British background, 71% (2631) had English as the primary family spoken language (PSL), 14% (532) lived in areas of high deprivation, and 17% (643) had high (>33%) rates of non-attendance. The families of 73% (2682) had activated the portal. In adjusted analyses, English as a PSL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.66-2.36) was positively associated with portal activation, whilst families from British Black African backgrounds (aOR 0.58, 0.44-0.77), those living in areas of deprivation (aOR 0.81, 0.67-0.98) or with high rates of non-attendance (aOR 0.32, 0.27-0.39) were less likely to use the portal.Conclusions Socio-economic deprivation, race/ethnicity and previous low engagement with health care services are potentially key drivers of widening inequity in access to health care following the implementation of patient portals, a digital health innovation intended to inform and empower patients. Health care providers should be aware that innovative human-driven engagement approaches, targeted towards under-served communities, are needed to ensure equitable access to high quality patient-centred care.Author Summary From a retrospective cross-sectional study of 3687 children with complex health disorders within a specialist paediatric care centre, the families of 73% had adopted an electronic patient portal within 2.5 years of portal launch. Relative socio-economic deprivation, family ethnic backgrounds and previous poor engagement with health care services were independently associated with lower odds of family adoption There was evidence of a potential differential impact of socioeconomic deprivation and spoken language across different ethnic groups. We report that equitable uptake of digital health services by children’s families requires health care providers to implement engagement approaches developed in partnership with under-served communities. However, those underserved communities should also have access to alternative patient centred communication pathways to ensure true inclusion in health care provision. Care providers must be particularly careful to offer these alternative pathways to families who have struggled to interact with healthcare in the past."

Fatigue can significantly impact gait dynamics, especially in athletes engaged in low-intensity training sessions like university football players. This study aimed to investigate the sensitivity of wearable sensors in detecting fatigue induced by low-intensity football training among university players. Twenty healthy male university football players participated in the study, undergoing gait analysis using wearable sensors before and after a 90-minute football training session. Data were collected using shoe-type IMU sensors for gait analysis, GPS trackers for exercise monitoring, and heart rate monitors for heart rate assessment. Participants also reported their perceived exertion using the Borg RPE scale. Results showed significant changes in various gait parameters post-exercise, including decreased cadence, increased percentage of double support, decreased percentage of single support, and increased time of toe-off. However, parameters like stride length remained unchanged. Center of gravity parameters did not show significant differences except for an increase in the ML(Y) acceleration post-exercise. The study suggests that even low to moderate-intensity exercise can induce fatigue, impacting walking dynamics. Wearable IMU sensors proved highly sensitive in detecting accumulated fatigue, even in low-intensity exercises, providing valuable insights into athletes’ physical deterioration during daily activities. This method could be crucial for monitoring fatigue and preventing injuries among athletes engaged in various sports activities. Further research is recommended to explore the impact of fatigue on other gait features and to evaluate gender differences. Additionally, examining muscle phosphocreatine readings could provide further insights into fatigue-related changes in gait. Nonetheless, the study highlights the effectiveness of wearable IMU sensor gait tests in detecting fatigue induced by low to moderate-intensity exercises, emphasizing the importance of monitoring fatigue for injury prevention and performance optimization in athletes."

Dosing followed WHO weight-bands. The primary endpoint was viral load(VL) <400copies/mL at week-96, analysed using logistic regression, hypothesising that DTG and DRV/r would be superior (threshold p=0.03) to LPV/r and ATV/r arms combined and ATV/r would be non-inferior to LPV/r(12% margin). Secondary endpoints included immunology and safety. Analyses were intention-to-treat.Results 919 children, median(IQR) age 10(8-13) years, 54% male, baseline VL 17,573(5549,55700) copies/mL, CD4 669(413, 971) cells/mm3, weight-for-age Z-score -1.6(-2.4,-0.9), had spent median(IQR) 5.6(3.3,7.8) years on first-line ART. At week-96, DTG was superior (by 9.7%(95% CI 4.8%, 14.5%); p<0.0001) and DRV/r showed a trend to superiority(by 5.6%(0.3%, 11.0%); p=0.04) compared to LPV/r and ATV/r arms combined. ATV/r was non-inferior to LPV/r(+3.4%(-3.4%,+10.2%); p=0.33). CD4 counts increased with no differences between arms. Toxicity was lowest with DTG. All arms except LPV/r showed age-appropriate weight/height gains at week-96. DTG was not associated with excess absolute weight-gain(<1kg) vs. DRV/r or ATZ/r, irrespective of backbone randomisation.Conclusions DTG-based regimens are safe and cost-effective for second-line ART. DRV/r and ATV/r are also good options. Fixed-dose combinations of DTG, DRV/r or ATV/r with nucleoside/nucleotide-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors(NRTIs) would increase access to robust, essential second-line options for children.(ISRCTN22964075)"

CWAS-Plus, adapted from a Python package for category-wide association testing (CWAS) employs both whole-genome sequencing and user-provided functional data to enhance noncoding variant analysis, with a faster and more efficient execution of the CWAS workflow. Here, we used single-nuclei assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing to facilitate CWAS-guided noncoding variant analysis at cell-type specific enhancers and promoters. Examining autism spectrum disorder whole-genome sequencing data (n = 7,280), CWAS-Plus identified noncoding de novo variant associations in transcription factor binding sites within conserved loci. Independently, in Alzheimer’s disease whole-genome sequencing data (n = 1,087), CWAS-Plus detected rare noncoding variant associations in microglia-specific regulatory elements. These findings highlight CWAS-Plus’s utility in genomic disorders and scalability for processing large-scale whole-genome sequencing data and in multiple-testing corrections.

We sequenced over 6,500 SARS-CoV-2 Alpha genomes (B.1.1.7) across seven months within Thuringia while collecting patients’ isolation dates and postal codes. Our dataset is complemented by over 66,000 publicly available German Alpha genomes and mobile service data for Thuringia. We identified the existence and spread of nine persistent mutation variants within the Alpha lineage, seven of which formed separate phylogenetic clusters with different spreading patterns in Thuringia. The remaining two are sub-clusters. Mobile service data can indicate these clusters’ spread and highlight a potential sampling bias, especially of low-prevalence variants. Thereby, mobile service data can be used either retrospectively to assess surveillance coverage and efficiency from already collected data or to actively guide part of a surveillance sampling process to districts where these variants are expected to emerge. The latter concept proved successful as we introduced a mobility-guided sampling strategy for the surveillance of Omicron sublineage BQ.1.1. The combination of mobile service data and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance by genome sequencing is a valuable tool for more targeted and responsive surveillance."

Such a system could transform disease diagnosis, ecological preservation, and molecular surveillance of biothreats. Current storage systems use individual containers for nucleic acid samples, requiring single-sample retrieval that falls short compared with digital databases that allow complex and combinatorial data retrieval on aggregated data. Here, we leverage protective microcapsules with combinatorial DNA labeling that enables arbitrary retrieval on pooled biosamples analogous to Structured Query Languages. Ninety-six encapsulated pooled mock SARS-CoV-2 genomic samples barcoded with patient metadata are used to demonstrate queries with simultaneous matches to sample collection date ranges, locations, and patient health statuses, illustrating how such flexible queries can be used to yield immunological or epidemiological insights. The approach applies to any biosample database labeled with orthogonal barcodes, enabling complex post-hoc analysis, for example, to study global biothreat epidemiology."

Moreover, the underlying mediator between PA and IBDs remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the causal effect of PA on IBD and the role of BMI as a mediator between PA and IBD.Methods Instrumental variables for the main exposures, i.e., moderate to vigorous intense PA during leisure time (MVPA) and leisure screen time (LST), were extracted from the meta-analysis on genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Summary statistics of IBD, CD, and UC were retrieved from the GWASs on European populations. Univariable Mendelian randomization (UVMR) analysis was performed to investigate the net and individual effects of MVPA and LST on the risk of IBD. Multivariate MR analysis was performed to investigate the effect of mediators on the risk of IBD.Results MR analysis revealed a protective relationship between MVPA and the risk of IBD and CD. Higher genetically-predicted LST was associated with increased risk of IBD and CD. The proportion of the effect of LST on IBD/CD mediated by BMI was determined to be 0.8% and 3.7%. The proportion of the effect of MVPA on IBD/CD mediated by BMI was determined to be 3.5% and 11.0%.Conclusion Our findings indicate a causal relationship between PA and IBD/CD and elucidate the increased risk of IBD/CD due to reduced PA is partially mediated by increased BMI.What is already known?Observational studies have shown that occupations involving more physical labor are associated with a lower risk of IBD compared with sedentary occupations.What is new here?The causal effect of PA on IBD and the role of BMI as a mediator between PA and IBD were investigated.How can this study help patient care?The incidence of CD can be reduced by promoting lifestyle management, such as reducing recreational sedentary activities and encouraging proper exercise. In addition, individuals who are not physically active should monitor their BMI to prevent the development of CD."

We aimed to conduct a non-randomized comparative study between conservative surgical treatment of placenta accreta spectrum and classical caesarean hysterectomy, under the name of the “CMNT PAS” study. To determine the sample size and the expected difference between the two groups, we conduct this pilot study.Study design It was a monocentric prospective observational study from January 4, 2020, to August 17, 2022. Patients were allocated into two groups: Group Conservative Surgery (CSG) in which the method detailed in prior research by Palacios-Jaraquemada was slightly modified by our team, control group (CG) when the caesarean hysterectomy was performed.Results Our main goal is to determine the sample size for our principal study and provide adequate data for any other team wishing to study the conservative surgical treatment of placenta accreta spectrum. So, the sample size for a power of 90% and an alpha risk of 5%, the size of each group must be 22 patients. Regarding primary outcomes: estimated blood loss volume was lower in CG compared to CSG but not statistically significant.Conclusion Our pilot study found that the caesarean hysterectomy is similar to conservative surgical treatment for placenta accreta in estimated blood loss. However, the latter helps preserve uterus and possibly fertility.Why was this study conducted?Conducting a pilot study to determine the expected difference in estimated blood loss between conservative surgical treatment and caesarean hysterectomy in placenta accreta, as well as to ascertain the sample size required for a definitive study.What are the key findings?Regarding primary outcomes: estimated blood loss volume was lower in CG compared to CSG but not statistically significant. Our main goal is to determine the sample size for our principal study and provide adequate data for any other team wishing to study the conservative surgical treatment of placenta accreta. So, for our original study, the sample size for a power of 90% and an alpha risk of 5%, the size of each group must be 22 patients.What does this study add to what we already know?Enabling other teams to compare conservative surgical treatment for placenta accreta with caesarean hysterectomy."

We investigated whether physical fitness may explain sex differences in daily physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) among older people.Methods A population-based cohort of 75, 80, and 85-year-old men and women (n=409, 62 % women) underwent laboratory-based assessment of walking speed, maximal knee extension strength, and body fat percentage. Free-living physical activity was assessed as total PAEE, and light (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) using individually calibrated combined accelerometry and heart rate sensing. Path modelling was used to examine indirect associations between sex, physical fitness, and physical activity.Results Men had a more favourable physical fitness profile and higher overall PAEE (mean 34.0 (SD 10.8) kJ/kg/day) than women (28.3 (8.4) kJ/kg/day, p<0.001). The path model for PAEE explained 33 % of the variance. The direct association of sex on PAEE was non-significant, whereas the association between sex and PAEE through body fat (β=0.20, p<0.001) and walking speed (β=0.05, p=0.001) were statistically significant. Similarly, the associations between sex and MVPA through body fat (β=0.11, p=0.002) and walking speed (β=0.05, p=0.001) were significant, as were the associations between sex and LPA through body fat (β=0.24, p<0.001) and walking speed (β=0.03, p=0.019).Conclusion Differences in physical activity between men and women may reflect underlying differences in cardiorespiratory fitness and adiposity. These results highlight the importance of maintaining physical fitness to support active living in older adults."

Recently, the quantification of mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been gaining popularity. Targeted NGS approaches are preferable in ctDNA analysis as they provide greater sequencing depth and affordability compared to whole genome NGS. Targeted NGS can be achieved through various library preparation methods, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Here we introduce Bridge Capture, a novel technology that combines the advantages of market-leading liquid biopsy technologies while eliminating the need to compromise between scalability, cost-efficiency, sensitivity, or panel size. We compared Bridge Capture to leading commercial technologies currently available in cancer diagnostics; Archer™ LIQUIDPlex™ and AmpliSeq™ Cancer HotSpot Panel v2 for Illumina®. We found high mutant allele frequency (MAF) concordance as well as the lowest MAF among the three technologies on matched contrived colorectal biospecimens mimicking ctDNA. We showed the reproducibility of Bridge Capture by observing a high correlation between results from two independent laboratories. Additionally, we demonstrate the capability of Bridge Capture to affordably utilize bench-top sequencers for low MAF patient samples. Therefore, we believe that Bridge Capture will considerably enhance cancer diagnostics as a cost efficient, simple, rapid and sensitive precision diagnostic tool."

UK pharmaceutical industry self-regulatory bodies require member companies who sign up to their code of conduct to publish details of their payments. They are also required to publish the methodologies underlying these payments - methodological notes. This study aimed to analyse UK pharmaceutical companies’ methodological notes and their adherence to the relevant codes of conduct and guidance.Methods We conducted a content analysis of methodological notes for the years 2015, 2017 and 2019 and assessed companies’ adherence to self-regulatory bodies’ requirements and recommendations for methodology disclosure.Results Overall, 90 companies made payment disclosures in all three years, publishing 269 methodological notes. We found gaps in adherence to self-regulatory requirements. Only 3 (3.3%) companies provided clear information for all self-regulatory body recommendations and regulations in all of their notes. Companies also varied in their approaches to important areas. For example, of the 244 notes with clear information on VAT management, 36.1% (N=88) included VAT, 30.3% (N=74) excluded VAT, and 33.6% (N=82) had multiple rules for VAT.Conclusions There was evidence of widespread non-adherence to self-regulatory requirements. This suggests flaws with self-regulation and a need for greater enforcement of rules or consideration of a publicly mandated disclosure system."

Despite its importance, little is known about MHM in Malawi, particularly at a household level. Through a household survey of MHM within 2 districts, we evaluated the type of menstrual absorbents used by people who menstruate. Reusable cloths/rags were the most used menstrual absorbent, used by 79.5% of respondents, whilst disposable absorbents, such as tampons and sanitary pads, were used by 18.6% of respondents. Appropriate MHM also incorporates adequate management of MHM materials, including the washing and drying of reusable menstrual absorbents. We evaluated the cleaning of reusable menstrual absorbents; most respondents (90.1%) reported appropriate washing of menstrual absorbents using soap and water, however only 20.3% reported that menstrual absorbents were dried outside in the sun (as is best practise) with most reporting that reusable menstrual absorbents were dried inside their homes. Our findings highlight the need for improved MHM within Malawi, not only in the access and affordability of appropriate menstrual absorbents but also the promotion of appropriate washing and drying of menstrual absorbents."

Those with Long Covid may face epistemic injustice, where they are unjustifiably viewed as unreliable evaluators of their own illness experiences. Media articles both reflect and influence perception and subsequently how people regard children and young people (CYP) with Long Covid, and may contribute to epistemic injustice.We aimed to explore how the UK media characterises Long Covid in CYP through examining three key actor groups: parents, healthcare professionals, and CYP with Long Covid, through the lens of epistemic injustice. A systematic search strategy resulted in the inclusion of 103 UK media articles. We used an adapted corpus-assisted Critical Discourse Analysis in tandem with thematic analysis. Specifically, we utilised search terms to locate concordances of key actor groups.In the corpus, parents highlighted minimisation of Long Covid, barriers to care, and experiences of personal attacks. Mothers were presented as also having Long Covid. Fathers were not mentioned once. Healthcare professionals emphasised the rarity of Long Covid in CYP, avoided pathologizing Long Covid, and overemphasised psychological components. CYP rarely were consulted in media articles but were presented as formerly very able. Manifestations of Long Covid in CYP were validated or invalidated in relation to adults.Media characterisations contributed to epistemic injustice. The disempowering portrayal of parents promote stigma and barriers to care. Healthcare professionals’ narratives often contributed to negative healthcare experiences and enacted testimonial injustice, where CYP and parent’s credibility was diminished due to unfair identity prejudice, in their invalidation of Long Covid. Media characterisations reveal and maintain a lack of societal framework for understanding Long Covid in CYP. The findings of this study illustrate the discursive practices employed by journalists that contribute to experiences of epistemic injustice. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for journalists."

The novel compound RG7203 promotes reward learning via dopamine D1-dependent signaling and therefore holds promise to improve especially the apathy dimension of negative symptoms. When tested as add-on to antipsychotic medication apathy did not change significantly with RG7203 versus placebo. However, the response varied across patients, and a subset showed clinically relevant improvement of apathy. It remains unclear if these interindividual differences are related to neurobiological correlates. Due to the predominant binding of RG7203 in the striatum, we asked how apathy changes with RG7203 are related to changes in cortico-striatal connectivity. We focused on cortico-striatal circuits that have been associated with apathy and previously showed connectivity alterations in schizophrenia. In a double-blind, 3-way randomized crossover study, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 24 individuals with schizophrenia following a 3-week administration of placebo, 5mg or 15mg of RG7203 as add-on to antipsychotics. We found that 5mg or 15mg of RG7203 did not lead to significant changes in striatal connectivity. However, changes in the apathy response across individuals were reflected by striatal connectivity changes. Apathy improvement with 5mg RG7203 vs. placebo was associated with increased connectivity between ventral caudate (vCaud) and paracingulate gyrus (PCG) as well as anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The same trend was observed for 15mg RG7203 vs. placebo. Importantly, such associations were not observed for the negative symptom dimension of expressive deficits. These findings suggest that the relationship between vCaud-PCG/ACC connectivity and apathy response with RG7203 should be further explored in larger clinical studies. Replication and further elaboration of these findings could help to advance biologically informed treatment options for negative symptoms."

This study aims to determine whether plasma phosphorylated-Tau181 (pTau181) could be used as diagnostic biomarker of concurrent Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) or amyloidosis alone, as well as a prognostic, monitoring, and susceptibility/risk biomarker for clinical outcomes in LBD. Our sample comprised 565 Stanford research participants: 94 LBD with normal cognition, 83 LBD with abnormal cognition, 114 AD, and 274 who were cognitively normal. We measured plasma pTau181 levels with the Lumipulse G platform. Diagnostic accuracy for concurrent ADNC and amyloidosis was assessed with receiver-operating-characteristic curves in a subset of participants with CSF pTau181/Aβ42, and CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 or amyloid-β PET, respectively. We used linear mixed effects models to examine the associations between baseline and longitudinal plasma pTau181 levels and clinical outcomes. Plasma pTau181 predicted concurrent ADNC and amyloidosis in LBD with abnormal cognition with 87% and 72% accuracy, respectively. In the LBD with abnormal cognition, higher baseline plasma pTau181 was associated with worse baseline MoCA and CDR-SB, as well as accelerated decline in CDR-SB. Additionally, in this group rapid increases in plasma pTau181 over 3 years predicted a faster decline in CDR-SB and memory. In LBD with normal cognition, there was no association between baseline or longitudinal plasma pTau181 levels and clinical outcomes; however, elevated pTau181 at baseline increased the risk of conversion to cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that plasma pTau181 is a promising biomarker for concurrent ADNC and amyloidosis in LBD. Furthermore, plasma pTau181 holds potential as a prognostic, monitoring, and susceptibility/risk biomarker, predicting disease progression in LBD."

This study assessed the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of AMR organisms from drinking and wastewater.Materials and methods This cross-sectional study conducted randomly on 30 samples (15 drinking water samples from household places; 15 sewage lifts stations) and collected aseptically, filtered, inoculated and isolated from culture plates, identified biochemically of pathogenic bacteria, and disc diffusion tested for antibiotic susceptibility. The primers of the targeted antimicrobial resistance genes were used for molecular amplification.Results Twenty-five bacteria were isolated from 30 drinking and wastewater samples. Pseudomonas spp. (36%), Enterobacter spp. (28%), Escherichia coli (20%), Citrobacter spp.(4%), Acinetobacter spp (4%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (4%) were isolated. Most of the isolates exhibited resistance to multiple groups of antibiotics, with meropenem, imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin showing the highest sensitivity against the isolates. Multiplex PCR confirmed the presence of two ESBL genes (blaSHV and blaCTX-M-15) and five carbapenemase genes (blaIMP, blaVIM, blaKPC, blaOXA1, blaNDM1) in resistant bacteria and blaCTX-M-15 (53.3%) followed by blaKPC (46.7%) genes were the most prevalent from drinking and wastewater samples respectively. According to WHO’s sanitary inspection risk score classification, 60% of drinking water samples scored 4 out of 11, categorizing them as intermediate risk based on hazard score.Conclusions This study addresses antimicrobial resistance in the environment, emphasizing public health implications; advocating for improved environmental regulations to mitigate AMR organism discharge through wastewater and drinking water.The significance of the study The study attempted to determine the pattern of antimicrobial resistance of microorganisms using phenotypic and genotypic methods by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), targeting particular genes with specific sequence of primers. As in Bangladesh very few studies for antimicrobial resistance organisms from drinking water and wastewater around household and hospital environments in Dhaka city, yet finished to change public health perspectives, and inform respective authorities for making decision. Thus the research contributes to generating some evidence-based information about the reservoir of antimicrobial resistance in environment."

The goal was to build capacity in ICU nurses by teaching standards of care and documentation, improving interdisciplinary communication, and scaling up participants’ knowledge and comfort levels in providing quality care. Nurse educators from the Alliance for Global Clinical Training (Alliance) designed the program and conducted the critical care nursing curriculum. Topics were selected by Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) nursing peers who also provided facility information. Understanding what resources and infrastructure are routinely available is essential to applying concepts to practice. The MNH administrative team and nursing education liaison sought out the best suited participants. Identifying talent in participants for ToT programs is crucial to their success. Nurse participants were chosen as effective representatives of their individual units to be future agents of change. Participants described what they most wanted from the program, including: increased knowledge in documentation, communication, and overall critical care specialized training. Pre- and post-knowledge assessments tested critical care knowledge. The nursing process ADPIE (Assessment, Diagnosis, Problem, Intervention, Evaluation) and SBAR communication (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) were provided tools for standard operating procedures which enhance interdisciplinary management of care. Clear and consistent documentation with ADPIE requires clinical assessment and evidence-based diagnoses. Standardized communication with SBAR provides an organized framework to professionally relay critical information and provide recommendations. All materials were provided in an open-access format for the program to be easily replicated by the participants. A long-term goal of this training was to assess impact and sustainability."

Ensuring high-quality T1-weighted scans is vital as image quality affects reliability of outcome measures. However, visual inspection can be subjective and time-consuming, especially with large datasets. The effectiveness of automated quality control (QC) tools for clinical cohorts remains uncertain. In this study, we used T1w scans from elderly participants within ageing and clinical populations to test the accuracy of existing QC tools with respect to visual QC and to establish a new quality prediction framework for clinical research use.Methods Four datasets acquired from multiple scanners and sites were used (N = 2438, 11 sites, 39 scanner manufacturer models, 3 field strengths – 1.5T, 3T, 2.9T, patients and controls, average age 71 ± 8 years). All structural T1w scans were processed with two standard automated QC pipelines (MRIQC and CAT12). The agreement of the accept-reject ratings was compared between the automated pipelines and with visual QC. We then designed a quality prediction framework that combines the QC measures from the existing automated tools and is trained on clinical datasets. We tested the classifier performance using cross-validation on data from all sites together, also examining the performance across diagnostic groups. We then tested the generalisability of our approach when leaving one site out and explored how well our approach generalises to data from a different scanner manufacturer and/or field strength from those used for training.Results Our results show significant agreement between automated QC tools and visual QC (Kappa=0.30 with MRIQC predictions; Kappa=0.28 with CAT12’s rating) when considering the entire dataset, but the agreement was highly variable across datasets. Our proposed robust undersampling boost (RUS) classifier achieved 87.7% balanced accuracy on the test data combined from different sites (with 86.6% and 88.3% balanced accuracy on scans from patients and controls respectively). This classifier was also found to be generalisable on different combinations of training and test datasets (leave-one-site-out = 78.2% average balanced accuracy; exploratory models = 77.7% average balanced accuracy).Conclusion While existing QC tools may not be robustly applicable to datasets comprised of older adults who have a higher rate of atrophy, they produce quality metrics that can be leveraged to train a more robust quality control classifiers for ageing and clinical cohorts."

This study aims to determine the prevalence of SAD and its associated factors within this population. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a Google Form survey distributed across various universities from September 17, 2023, to February 1, 2024. The survey comprised two sections: sociodemographic information and 17 items of the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), which measures the frequency and intensity of social anxiety symptoms. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and inferential analysis, multiple regression, and binomial logistic regression. Out of 506 participants, 455 were included in the study. Results revealed that 39.1% exhibited no or very mild symptoms of SAD, while 23.7% experienced mild symptoms, 21.3% faced moderate symptoms, and 11.6% and 4.2% presented with severe to very severe symptoms, respectively. Factors such as gender (p < 0.0001), previous academic failures (p = 0.013), family history of mental health issues (p = 0.009), exercise frequency (p < 0.0001), and perceptions of relationships with classmates (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with SAD. Females showed a higher probability of SAD compared to males (OR = 1.976). Individuals engaging in over 90 minutes of exercise per week were less likely to have SAD (OR = 0.383), and occasional smokers had a lower risk of SAD compared to non-smokers (OR = 0.422). Our study uncovered a notably elevated prevalence of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) among foreign-born undergraduate students in Türkiye. Factors such as being female, having a family history of mental illnesses, studying in a stressful environment, experiencing academic failure, and engaging in less frequent exercise were associated with noticeable symptoms of SAD. These findings emphasize the urgent need for heightened efforts in recognizing and addressing SAD within this population."

Using a sample of older adults from England, this study tested (1) if pre-pandemic PA and its changes during the pandemic were associated with mental health responses; (2) if older adults with low-grade inflammation experienced greater increases in depression and anxiety, compared to pre-pandemic levels; (3) if PA attenuated the association between inflammation and depression/anxiety. The study used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a cohort study following a national sample aged 50+. Information on mental health and PA were collected before the pandemic (2016/17 and 2018/19) and during November and December 2020. Inflammation was ascertained using pre-pandemic C-reactive protein (CRP). Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and health-related factors and pre-pandemic mental health. Increasing PA from before to during the pandemic was linked to reduced odds of depression (OR = 0.955, 95%CI [0.937, 0.974]) and anxiety (OR = 0.954, 95%CI [0.927;0.982]). Higher pre-pandemic PA was associated with reduced odds of depression (OR = 0.964, 95%CI [0.948, 0.981]) and anxiety (OR = 0.976, 95%CI [0.953, 1.000]), whereas elevated CRP was associated with 1.343 times higher odds of depression (95%CI [1.100, 1.641]). PA did not attenuate the inflammation-depression association. The findings suggest that PA may contribute to psychological resilience among older adults, independently of inflammation. Further research is needed to explore the psychobiological pathways underlying this protective mechanism."

Because GWAS risk loci are enriched in expression/protein/methylation quantitative loci (e/p/mQTL, hereafter xQTL), transcriptome/proteome/methylome-wide association studies (T/P/MWAS, hereafter XWAS) that integrate xQTL and GWAS information, can link GWAS signals to effects on specific genes. To further increase detection power, gene signals are aggregated within relevant gene sets (GS) by performing gene set enrichment (GSE) analyses.Often GSE methods test for enrichment of “signal” genes in curated GS while overlooking their linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, allowing for the possibility of increased false positive rates. Moreover, no GSE tool uses xQTL information to perform mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. To make causal inference on association between PD and GS, we develop a novel MR GSE (MR-GSE) procedure. First, we generate a “synthetic” GWAS for each MSigDB GS by aggregating summary statistics for x-level (mRNA, protein or DNA methylation (DNAm) levels) from the largest xQTL studies available) of genes in a GS. Second, we use synthetic GS GWAS as exposure in a generalized summary-data-based-MR analysis of complex trait outcomes.We applied MR-GSE to GWAS of nine important PD. When applied to the underpowered opioid use disorder GWAS, none of the four analyses yielded any signals, which suggests a good control of false positive rates. For other PD, MR-GSE greatly increased the detection of GO terms signals (2,594) when compared to the commonly used (non-MR) GSE method (286). Some of the findings might be easier to adapt for treatment, e.g., our analyses suggest modest positive effects for supplementation with certain vitamins and/or omega-3 for schizophrenia, bipolar and major depression disorder patients. Similar to other MR methods, when applying MR-GSE researchers should be mindful of the confounding effects of horizontal pleiotropy on statistical inference."

Clade I MPXV is prevalent in Central Africa and characterized by severe disease and high mortality, while Clade II is confined to West Africa and associated with milder illness. A Clade IIb MPXV emerged in Nigeria in 2017, with protracted human-to-human transmission a forerunner of the global Clade II B.1 lineage outbreak in 2022. In October 2023, a large mpox outbreak emerged in the Kamituga mining region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), of which we conducted an outbreak investigation.Methods Surveillance data and hospital records were collected between October 2023 and January 2024. Blood samples and skin/oropharyngeal swabs were obtained for molecular diagnosis at the National Institute of Biomedical Research, Kinshasa. MPXV genomes were sequenced and analyzed using Illumina NextSeq 2000 and bioinformatic tools.Results The Kamituga mpox outbreak spread rapidly, with 241 suspected cases reported within 5 months of the first reported case. Of 108 confirmed cases, 29% were sex workers, highlighting sexual contact as a key mode of infection. Genomic analysis revealed a distinct MPXV Clade Ib lineage, divergent from previously sequenced Clade I strains in DRC. Predominance of APOBEC3-type mutations and estimated time of emergence around mid-September 2023 suggest recent human-to-human transmission.Conclusions Urgent measures, including reinforced, expanded surveillance, contact tracing, case management support, and targeted vaccination are needed to contain this new pandemic-potential Clade Ib outbreak."

In Pakistan, this risk is especially serious given the emergence of an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Salmonella Typhi strain, a strain attributed to S. Typhi acquisition of the blaCTX-M-15 gene. The now-dominant XDR S. Typhi strain, non-XDR S. Typhi, and blaCTX-M genes are readily disseminated via drinking water and wastewater in Pakistan and may also be present in biofilms associated with these environmental sources. This study investigates the presence of S. Typhi and blaCTX-M genes within these environmental compartments. Drinking water (n=35) or wastewater samples (n=35) and samples of their associated biofilms were collected from Karachi and Hyderabad, Pakistan. Samples were tested by PCR for S. Typhi and blaCTX-M group 1 genes as a proxy for blaCTX-M-15. Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) were conducted to assess microbial load. S. Typhi was detected by PCR in one bulk wastewater sample and one drinking water biofilm. BlaCTX-M group 1 genes were detected in all sample types and were detected more frequently in bulk wastewater (n=13/35) than in drinking water (n=2/35) and more frequently overall in biofilm samples (n=22/70) versus bulk water (n=15/70). Detection of blaCTX-M in biofilm was not significantly associated with detection in the associated bulk water sample. This study marks the first detection of S. Typhi in drinking water biofilms and the first report of blaCTX-M genes in environmental biofilms in Pakistan. Environmental biofilms, particularly in drinking water systems, may serve as reservoirs for human exposure to S. Typhi and drug resistance genes. This study underscores the importance of expanding surveillance strategies to include biofilm sampling, providing valuable insights into pathogen dissemination in water systems, and informing targeted public health interventions to prevent waterborne diseases."

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides more information than standard molecular and phenotypic testing, but commonly used platforms are expensive to implement, and data interpretation requires significant expertise.Aims We aimed to optimise a TB WGS diagnostic pipeline balancing user-friendliness, cost- effectiveness and time to results, whilst ensuring accuracy.Materials and methods Growth conditions, DNA extraction protocols and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) library preparation kits were compared. Software for basecalling and analysis were evaluated to find the most accurate resistance SNP and lineage predictor.Results Optimally, a spin-column CTAB DNA extraction method was combined with the RBK110.96 library preparation kit, high accuracy basecalling and data analysis using TB-Profiler. Compared with Illumina, the pipeline was concordant for 16/17 (94%) isolates (lineage) and for 17/17 (100%) isolates (resistance SNPs). Our pipeline was 71% (12/17) concordant with phenotypic drug susceptibility test (DST) results. Time-to-diagnosis was around four weeks.Conclusions This optimised TB sequencing pipeline requires less time expertise to run and analyse than Illumina, takes less time than phenotypic DSTs and the results are comparable with Illumina. The cost per sample is comparable with other methods. These features make it an important tool for incorporating into routine DR-TB diagnostic pipelines and larger scale drug resistance surveillance in all settings."

Here, we used human genetic data to compare the predicted therapeutic and adverse effects of APOC3, ANGPTL3, and ANGPTL4 inactivation.Methods We conducted drug-target Mendelian randomization analyses using variants in proximity to the genes associated with circulating protein levels to compare APOC3, ANGPTL3, and ANGPTL4 as drug targets. We obtained exposure and outcome data from large-scale genome-wide association studies and used generalized least squares to correct for linkage disequilibrium-related correlation. We evaluated five primary cardiometabolic endpoints and screened for potential side effects across 694 disease-related endpoints, 43 clinical laboratory tests, and 11 internal organ MRI measurements.Results Genetically lowering circulating ANGPTL4 levels reduced the odds of coronary artery disease (CAD) (odds ratio, 0.57 per s.d. protein [95%CI,0.47–0.70]) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (odds ratio, 0.73 per s.d. protein [95%CI,0.57–0.94]). Genetically lowering circulating APOC3 levels also reduced the odds of CAD (odds ratio, 0.90 per s.d. protein [95%CI,0.82–0.99]). Genetically lowered ANGPTL3 levels via common variants were not associated with CAD. However, meta-analysis of deleterious variants revealed that ANGPTL3 inactivation protected against CAD (odds ratio, 0.79 per allele [95%CI, 0.69–0.90]). Analysis of lowered ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, and APOC3 levels did not identify important safety concerns.Conclusion Human genetic evidence suggests that therapies aimed at reducing circulating levels of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, and APOC3 reduce the risk of CAD. ANGPTL4 lowering may also reduce the risk of T2D.Key Question Does human genetics support that triglyceride-lowering drugs targeting ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, and APOC3 will reduce the risk of cardiometabolic disease without causing side effects?Key Finding Genetically lowered circulating ANGPTL4 reduced coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes risk. Genetically lowered ANGPTL3 and APOC3 also reduced coronary artery disease risk, but no impact on type 2 diabetes risk was observed.Take-home Message Human genetics suggest that ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, and APOC3-lowering medications may prevent CAD.

While automated detection systems show promise, misdiagnoses are common due to symptom similarities. This study investigates the differentiation of AFib from AFlut using standard 12-lead ECGs from the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2021 (CinC2021) databases, along with data from a private database. We employed both one dimensional-based (1D) and image-based (2D) Deep Learning models, comparing different 1D and 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for classification. For 1D models, LiteVGG-11 demonstrated the highest performed, achieving an accuracy (Acc) of 77.91 (±1.73%), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 87.17 (±1.29%), F1 score of 76.59 (±1.90%), specificity (Spe) of 71.69 (±4.73%), and sensitivity (Se) of 86.53 (±5.33%). On the other hand, for 2D models the EfficientNet-B2 outperformed other architectures, with an Acc of 75.20 (±3.38%), AUROC of 85.50 (±1.14%), F1 of 71.59 (±3.66%), Spe of 74.76 (±13.85%) and Se of 75.74 (±13.85%). Our findings indicate that distinguishing between AFib and AFlut is non-trivial, with 1D signals exhibiting superior performance compared to their 2D counterparts. Furthermore, it’s noteworthy that the performance of our models on the CinC2021 databases was considerably lower than on our private dataset."

It is not known whether gender or comorbidities modify associations between PTSD and CVD.Objective To assess risk of hypertension and atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) associated with PTSD in a predominantly young military population, and determine if gender or PTSD comorbidities modify these associations.Design, setting, and participants Using administrative medical records, this longitudinal, retrospective cohort study assessed relationships of PTSD, gender, comorbidities (metabolic risk factors [MRF], behavioral risk factors [BRF], depression, and sleep disorders) to subsequent hypertension and ASCVD among 863,993 active-duty U.S. Army enlisted soldiers (86.2% male; 93.7% <age 40). Using discrete-time survival analysis, person-months with an initial hypertension diagnosis (n=49,656) were compared to an equal-probability control sample. Separate analyses compared person-months with ASCVD (n=2,427) to an equal-probability control sample.Main outcomes and measures ICD-9-CM diagnoses of hypertension, ASCVD (coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure), PTSD, MRF (Type 2 diabetes, obesity), BRF (tobacco/alcohol use disorders), depression, and sleep disorders.Results PTSD was associated with subsequent hypertension (OR=3.0 [95% CI=2.9-3.1]), and ASCVD (OR=2.7 [95% CI=2.2-3.3]). These associations remained significant but were attenuated after adjusting for comorbidities and sociodemographic/service-related variables (Hypertension: OR=1.9 [95% CI=1.8-2.0]; ASCVD: OR=1.4 [95% CI=1.2-1.8]). For hypertension, gender and each comorbidity were significant explanatory variables in multivariable models, and there were significant PTSD interactions with gender, MRF, depression, and sleep disorders. Stratifying separately by gender and presence of each comorbidity, PTSD-hypertension associations were stronger among men, those without MRF, without depression, and without sleep disorders. Standardized risk estimates indicated that predicted hypertension rates for those with vs. without PTSD were higher for men, and for those with vs. without MRF, depression, and sleep disorders. For ASCVD, comorbidities, but not gender, were independent predictors, and associations between PTSD and ASCVD were not modified by gender or comorbidities.Conclusions and relevance PTSD and comorbidities are independent risk factors for hypertension and ASVD in younger individuals, and gender and comorbid conditions modify PTSD relationships with hypertension. These findings suggest that CVD preventive interventions address PTSD and medical and behavioral comorbidities."

The WHO Unity Household transmission investigation (HHTI) protocol provides a platform for the prospective and systematic collection of high-quality clinical, epidemiological, serological, and virological data from SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases and their household contacts. These data can be used to understand key severity and transmissibility parameters — including the asymptomatic proportion — in relation to local epidemic context and help inform public health response.Methods We aimed to estimate the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-variant infections in Unity-aligned HHTIs. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in alignment with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered our systematic review on PROSPERO (CRD42022378648). We searched EMBASE, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and bioRxiv and medRxiv from 1 November 2021 to 22 August 2023.Results We identified 8,368 records, of which 98 underwent full text review. We identified only three studies for data extraction, with substantial variation in study design and corresponding estimates of the asymptomatic proportion. As a result, we did not generate a pooled estimate or I2 metric.Conclusions The limited number of quality studies that we identified highlights the need for improved preparedness and response capabilities to facilitate robust HHTI implementation, analysis and reporting, to better inform national, regional and global risk assessments and policy making.Key messagesEstimates for the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-variant infections are highly heterogeneousWe assessed the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-variant infections among household contacts, who were followed prospectively and systematically, per the WHO Unity household transmission investigation protocol.Given the small number of studies with sufficient data and the observed heterogeneity in the asymptomatic proportion point estimates, we did not provide a pooled estimate of the asymptomatic proportion.Fit-for-purpose study designs, and improved reporting, are necessary for robust estimation of epidemiological characteristics from household studies and their interpretation.Ongoing assessment of the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to inform ongoing public health response options such as testing strategies to detect infections and isolation guidance for close contacts."

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) models relate blood antimalarial drug concentrations with the parasite-time profile to inform dosing regiments. We performed a simulation study to assess the utility of a Bayesian hierarchical mechanistic PK-PD model for predicting parasite-time profiles for a Phase 2 study of a new antimalarial drug, cipargamin.We simulated cipargamin concentration- and malaria parasite-profiles based on a Phase 2 study of 8 volunteers who received cipargamin 7 days after inoculation with malaria parasites. The cipargamin profiles were generated from a 2-compartment PK model and parasite profiles from a previously published biologically informed PD model. One-thousand PK-PD datasets of 8 patients were simulated, following the sampling intervals of the Phase 2 study. The mechanistic PK-PD model was incorporated in a Bayesian hierarchical framework and the parameters estimated.Population PK model parameters describing absorption, distribution and clearance were estimated with minimal bias (mean relative bias ranged from 1.7 to 8.4%). The PD model was fitted to the parasitaemia profiles in each simulated dataset using the estimated PK parameters. Posterior predictive checks demonstrate that our PK-PD model successfully captures both the pre- and post-treatment simulated PD profiles. The bias of the estimated population average PD parameters was low-moderate in magnitude.This simulation study demonstrates the viability of our PK-PD model to predict parasitological outcomes in Phase 2 volunteer infection studies. This work will inform the dose-effect relationship of cipargamin, guiding decisions on dosing regimens to evaluate in Phase 3 trials."

While both modalities show advantages over conservative management, the long-term mortality benefits post-AVR, especially when comparing TAVR with SAVR, remain uncertain.Objectives This study aimed to perform an in-depth meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing TAVR versus SAVR, as well as their outcomes against conservative management.Methods Electronic databases were searched up to December 7, 2023. Individual patient data extracted from Kaplan-Meier plots, underwent pooling and modeling with stratification by surgical risk. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 5 years.Results The study included eleven RCTs and twelve non-RCTs, encompassing 4215 patients undergoing TAVR, 4017 undergoing SAVR and comparing 11,285 AVR patients with 23,358 receiving conservative management. TAVR exhibited significantly lower all-cause mortality at 6 months (HR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.52-0.74) compared to SAVR, with no significant difference beyond 6 months (HR 1.08, 95% CI: 0.98-1.19). Additionally, over a 5-year period, there were no significant disparities in cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.83-1.16) or stroke (HR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.75-1.38) between TAVR and SAVR, while TAVR exhibited a notable advantage with a markedly reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality in the initial 6 months (HR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46-0.87) and stroke within the first month post-procedure (HR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.19-0.51). Furthermore, the mean aortic valve area and pressure gradient remained comparable between TAVR and SAVR, exhibiting stability throughout the 5-year follow-up period. AVR markedly reduced all-cause mortality compared to medical therapy (P < 0.001), with 5-year crude mortality rates of 31.6% versus 49.3%, and a difference in restricted mean survival time of 8.9 months. Similar outcomes were observed across high, intermediate, and low surgical risk categories.Conclusions While TAVR demonstrated early mortality reduction compared to SAVR, no distinctions emerged in the overall 5-year follow-up, regardless of surgical risk. AVR notably improved survival over conservative therapy. This study advocates for the preference of TAVR or SAVR in severe AS patients when feasible."

We used generalized estimating equations to examine changes in viral suppression (outcome) pre-post criminal charges (exposure), adjusting for other demographic and legal system factors.Results 9,534 PWH experienced criminal charges. Compared to others with charges, PWH were more likely to be male and report Black race. The median duration of unresolved charges was longer for PWH. When adjusting for demographic factors, the period following resolution of charges was modestly associated with an increased risk of viral suppression (aRR 1.03 (95% confidence interval 1.02-1.04) compared to the pre-charge period.Conclusions A significant portion of PWH in NC had criminal charges during a three-year period, and these charges went unresolved for a longer time than those without HIV.

Assessing the reliability and comparability of LLM-generated responses with those from well-trained neurologists, especially epileptologists, is crucial for ascertaining the value of LLMs in the presurgical evaluation.Objective To compare the quality of seizure semiology interpretations generated by ChatGPT with those provided by epileptologists.Design, Setting, and Participants A total of 865 descriptions of seizure semiology and validated epileptogenic zone (EZ) pairs were derived from 189 public papers. These semiology records were utilized as input of ChatGPT to generate responses on the most likely locations of EZ. Additionally, a panel of 5 epileptologists was recruited to complete an online survey by providing responses on EZ locations based on 100 well-defined semiology records. All responses from ChatGPT and epileptologists were graded for their reliability score (RS) and regional accuracy rate (RAR).Main outcome measures Evaluation and comparison of responses from ChatGPT and epileptologists at two granularity levels (general region level and specific region level), using the RS and the RAR.Results In evaluating responses to semiology queries, the highest RARs in each general region from ChatGPT-4.0 were 89.28% for the frontal lobe and 71.39% for the temporal lobe. However, the RAR was lower for the occipital lobe at 46.24%, the parietal lobe at 31.01%, the insular cortex at 8.51%, and the cingulate cortex at 2.78%. Comparatively, the RAR achieved by epileptologists was 82.76% for the frontal lobe, 58.33% for the temporal lobe, 68.42% for the occipital lobe, 50% for the parietal lobe, 60% for the insular cortex, and 28.57% for the cingulate cortex.Conclusions and Relevance In this study of seizure semiology interpretation, ChatGPT-4.0 outperformed epileptologists in interpreting seizure semiology originating in the frontal and temporal lobes, whereas epileptologists outperformed ChatGPT-4.0 in the occipital and parietal lobes, and significantly outperformed in the insular cortex and cingulate cortex. ChatGPT demonstrates the potential to assist in the preoperative assessment for epilepsy surgery. Presumably, with the continuous development of LLM, the reliability of ChatGPT will be strengthened in the foreseeable future."

We aimed to explore the fairness of current deep learning models and further create a more equitable model designed to minimize disparities in performance across groups.Methods This study used one proprietary and two publicly available datasets, containing two-dimensional (2D) wide-angle color fundus images, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) fundus images, and three-dimensional (3D) Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) B-Scans, to assess deep learning models for DR detection. We developed a Fair Adaptive Scaling (FAS) module that dynamically adjusts the significance of samples during model training for DR detection, aiming to lessen performance disparities across varied identity groups. FAS was incorporated into both 2D and 3D deep learning models to facilitate the binary classification of DR and non-DR cases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was adopted to measure the model performance. Additionally, we devised an equity-scaled AUC metric, which evaluates model fairness by balancing overall AUC against disparities among groups.Findings Using in-house color fundus images on the racial attribute, the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet, after integrating with FAS, improved from 0.88 and 0.83 to 0.90 and 0.84 (p < 0.05), with AUCs for Asians and Whites improving by 0.04 and 0.03, respectively (p < 0.01). Regarding gender, both the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet improved by 0.01 (p < 0.05) after integrating with FAS. While using in-house SLO fundus images based on race, the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet improved from 0.80 to 0.83 (p < 0.01), with AUCs for Asians, Blacks, and Whites improving by 0.02, 0.01 and 0.04, respectively (p < 0.05). On gender, FAS improved the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet by 0.02, with both genders showing an improvement of 0.02 (p < 0.01). Using the 3D deep learning model DenseNet121 on in-house OCT-B-Scans based on race, FAS improved the overall AUC and ES-AUC from 0.875 and 0.81 to 0.884 and 0.82 respectively, where the AUCs for Asians and Blacks improved by 0.03 and 0.02 (p < 0.01). On gender, FAS improved the overall AUC and ES-AUC of DenseNet121 by 0.04 and 0.03, while the AUCs for Females and Males improved by 0.05 and 0.04 (p < 0.01), respectively.Interpretation Existing deep learning models indeed exhibit variable performance across diverse identity groups in DR detection. The FAS proves beneficial in enhancing model equity and boosting DR detection accuracy, particularly for underrepresented groups."

Here, we focused on elucidating the correlation between structural and functional neural connectivity within a cohort of patients diagnosed with dystonia.Methods DTI images were obtained from twelve patients with dystonia prior to the deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. For each patient we processed the imaging data to estimate anatomical measures including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), number of fiber tracts per unit area (N), and fiber tract length (L). After the implantation of temporary depth leads for each patient as part of their treatment plan, intracranial signals were recorded. Transfer function models and the corresponding measures of functional connectivity were computed for each patient using local field potential (LFP) recordings. Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was then employed to determine the relationship between transfer function measures and DTI parameters.Results Our results illustrate a positive correlation between FA, AD, and intrinsic neural transmission measures obtained from the transfer functions models. However, no significant correlation was found between the functional connectivity (measures computed from the transfer functions gains) and number of fiber tracts or fiber lengths.Conclusion Our findings suggest that white matter integrity, as measured by FA and AD, can potentially reflect the amplification and spread of intrinsic brain signals throughout the network. This study underscores the significant relationship between structural and functional connectivity, offering valuable insights into propagation of neural activity in the brain network and potential implications for optimizing treatments for neurological disorders."

Therefore, this study investigates the causal relationship between RA and AS risk using Mendelian randomization (MR).Methods Genetic data related to RA and AS were sourced from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit Open-Genome-Wide Association Studies database and the seventh edition of the FinnGen Biobank gene database, respectively. The initial analysis employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method for the MR analysis, with other methods utilized as supplementary methods. To ensure the robustness and reliability of the conclusions, various sensitivity analyses were conducted.Results The MR results indicate a positive causal relationship between genetically determined RA and the risk of coronary atherosclerosis(OR = 1.026, 95% CI: 1.004, 1.049, p = 0.179), peripheral atherosclerosis(OR = 1.072, 95% CI: 1.035, 1.111, p < 0.001), and atherosclerosis excluding coronary atherosclerosis, cerebral atherosclerosis, and PAD (ASE) (OR = 1.046, 95% CI: 1.015, 1.079, p = 0.004), while no significant causal relationship with cerebral AS was observed. The MR-Egger regression did not reveal any significant horizontal pleiotropy.Conclusion This study elucidates the causal relationship between RA and various AS risks, highlighting the importance of actively detecting and intervening in RA for AS risk."

We investigated the complement system, a component of innate immunity, in AD patient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and evaluated its modulation by the anti-tau antibody semorinemab.METHODS Immunoassays were applied to measure intact (inactive) and cleaved (active) CSF complement proteins C4, Factor B and C3 in AD patients and a separate cognitively normal (CN) cohort.RESULTS All measured CSF complement proteins were increased in AD vs CN subjects, with cleaved C4 (C4a) displaying the most robust increase. Finally, semorinemab did not have a significant pharmacodynamic effect on CSF complement proteins.DISCUSSION Elevated levels of CSF intact/cleaved C4 and C3 are indicative of classical complement pathway activation in AD. Despite showing a reduction in CSF soluble tau species, semorinemab did not impact complement protein levels or activity. Further studies are needed to determine the value of complement proteins as neuroinflammation biomarkers in AD."

A promising approach to make progress with this conundrum is to parse distinct subtypes of this behaviour. Utilizing 1,624 children with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) and 3,224 healthy controls from the ABCD Study, we clustered children with STB based on thirty-four cognitive and psychopathological measures which capture suicide-related risk-moderating traits. Environmental and genetic risk factors, as well as neuroanatomical characteristics of each subtype, were then compared with controls. We identified five distinct STB subtypes, each revealing unique neuroanatomy, environmental/genetic risks, and persistence patterns. Subtype 1 (Depressive, 9.6%) exhibited the most severe depressive symptoms. Subtype 2 (Externalizing, 20.1%) displayed anatomical and functional alterations in frontoparietal network and increased genetic risk for ADHD. Subtype 3 (Cognitive Deficit, 20.4%) demonstrated lower cognitive performance and widespread white-matter deficits. Subtype 4 (Mild Psychotic, 22.2%) presented higher prodromal psychotic symptoms, often unnoticed by parents. Subtype 5 (High Functioning, 27.6%) showed larger total brain volume, better cognition, and higher socio-economic status, contrasting subtypes 1-4. Only Subtypes 1 and 2 demonstrate persistent STB features at the 2-year follow-up. Our results suggested that youth suicidal behaviour may result from several distinct bio-behavioral pathways that are identifiable through co-occurring psychopathology, and provide insights into the underlying neural mechanisms and corresponding intervention strategies."

Immune-related biomarkers including soluble sCD80 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (sCTLA-4) are not well studied in relation to depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue due to PE.Aims To study serum immune-inflammatory biomarkers of PE and delineate their associations with the Hamilton Depression (HAMD), Anxiety (HAMA), and Fibro-Fatigue (FF) rating Scale scores.Methods sCD80, sCTLA-4, vitamin D, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, zinc, copper, magnesium, and calcium were measured in 90 PE compared with 60 non-PE pregnant women.Results PE women show higher depression, anxiety and FF rating scale scores as compared with control women. sCTLA-4, sCD80, and copper were significantly higher and zinc, magnesium, and calcium significantly lower in PE women than in controls. Multiple regression analysis showed that around 55.8%-58.0% of the variance in the HAMD, HAMA and FF scores was explained by the regression on biomarkers; the top 3 most important biomarkers were sCTLA-4, sCD80, and vitamin D. The sCTLA-4/sCD80 ratio was significantly and inversely associated with the HAMD/HAMA/FF scores. We found that around 70% of the variance in systolic blood pressure could be explained by sCTLA-4, vitamin D, calcium, and copper.Conclusions The findings underscore that PE and depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue symptoms due to PE are accompanied by activation of the immune-inflammatory response system. More specifically, disbalances among soluble checkpoint molecules seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension and neuropsychiatric symptoms due to PE."

We used a random-effects model to pool data in the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2 software. Effect sizes were calculated as the standardized mean difference in interleukin concentrations between groups and then transformed into Hedge’s g statistic.LIMITATIONS Of the ILs included in the analysis (interleukin 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 22, and 33), 70% were with a high level of between-study heterogeneity and could not be fully accounted for by factors such as BMI, sex, age, and publication year. More studies are warranted to identify more contributing clinical variables.CONCLUSIONS Meta-analysis outcomes demonstrated higher circulating concentrations of IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-18 in T2DM patients, strengthening the clinical evidence that T2DM is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response.ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTSWhy did we undertake this study? Possible changes in circulating concentrations for most interleukins (ILs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients remains uncertain.What is the specific question(s) we wanted to answer? We wanted to quantitatively assess available data on circulating IL concentrations in T2DM patients and healthy weight control (HWC) subjects.What did we find? Increased circulating concentrations of IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-18 were found in T2DM patients compared with HWC.What are the implications of our findings? These findings affirm T2DM pathogenesis correlates with systemic inflammation, evidenced by elevated circulating concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins."

One of the inherent problems of low field MRI is its low signal-to-noise ratio or sensitivity. In this work, we introduce a multimodal surface coil technique for signal excitation and reception to improve the RF magnetic field (B1) efficiency and potentially improve MR sensitivity. The proposed multimodal surface coil consists of multiple identical resonators that are electromagnetically coupled to form a multimodal resonator. The field distribution of its lowest frequency mode is suitable for MR imaging applications. The prototype multimodal surface coils are built, and the performance is investigated and validated through numerical simulation, standard RF measurements and tests, and comparison with the conventional surface coil at low fields. Our results show that the B1 efficiency of the multimodal surface coil outperforms that of the conventional surface coil which is known to offer the highest B1 efficiency among all coil categories, i.e., volume coil, half-volume coil and surface coil. In addition, in low-field MRI, the required low-frequency coils often use large value capacitance to achieve the low resonant frequency which makes frequency tuning difficult. The proposed multimodal surface coil can be conveniently tuned to the required low frequency for low-field MRI with significantly reduced capacitance value, demonstrating excellent low-frequency operation capability over the conventional surface coil."

Outcomes included degree of weight loss and weight regain and motivation for seeking surgery.Results 346 persons were invited to complete the survey. 112 (32.4%) were completed, with 7 excluded due to not answering the AOM question. 73% reported AOM use. Among those who took AOMs prior to seeking bariatric surgery, average weight loss was 13 kg (SD ±10 kg) corresponding to a 4.4 kg/m2 decrease in BMI. Of past AOMs receipients, 87% reported weight regain upon stopping AOMs. Average weight regain was 18 kg (SD 13kg, 126% increase). Patients reported improved longevity and quality of life as motivation for seeking surgery with AOM use history having no effect. Subjects reported an average weight loss goal of 65.8 kg (39% of baseline weight) from bariatric surgery.Conclusion AOMs were commonly used in those seeking bariatric surgery but motivation for surgery did not differ by AOMs use history. Motivations were most often related to goals for better overall health.Study Importance QuestionsMinimal data exists regarding patients’ experience with anti-obesity medicaitons and whether prior experience with these medications impacts patients’ expectations or goals for bariatric surgery.This cross-sectional survey investigated the frequency of anti-obesity medication use prior to patients seeking bariatric surgery, finding nearly 3/4ths of patients seeking surgery have previously utilized pharmaceutical weight loss therapies.This study will ideally spur clinical trials to determine the most effective approach to combination therapy, thus moving obesity treatment to a multimodal approach."

Wearable devices and smartphones increasingly track physiological and lifestyle risk factors and can improve the management of metabolic diseases. However, the absence of clear guidelines for deriving meaningful signals from these devices often hampers cross-study comparisons.Objective Thus, this scoping review protocol aims to systematically overview the current empirical literature on how wearables and smartphones are used to measure modifiable risk factors associated with metabolic diseases.Methods We will conduct a scoping review to overview how wearables and smartphones measure modifiable risk factors related to metabolic diseases. We will search six databases (Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore) from 2019 to 2024, with search terms related to wearables, smartphones, and modifiable risk factors associated with metabolic diseases. We will apply the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) and Arksey and O’Malley’s scoping review methodology. Eligible studies will use smartphones and/or wearables (worn on the wrist, finger, arm, hip, and chest) to track physiological and/or lifestyle factors related to metabolic diseases. Two reviewers will independently screen articles for inclusion. Data will be extracted using a standardized form, and the findings will be synthesized and reported qualitatively and quantitatively.Results The study is expected to identify potential gaps in measuring modifiable risk factors in current digital metabolic health research. Results are expected to inform more standardized guidelines on wearable and smartphone-based measurements to aid cross-study comparison. The final report is planned for submission to an indexed journal.Conclusions This review is among the first to systematically overview the current landscape on how wearables and smartphones are used to measure modifiable risk factors associated with metabolic diseases."

It has increasingly become the object of scientific investigation in the last twenty years. However, its underlying brain mechanisms are still unclear. To fully capture its nature in the lab, researchers have increasingly relied on virtual reality (VR) as an emotion-elicitation method, which can resemble even complex phenomena in a limited space. In this work, a multidisciplinary team proposed a novel experimental protocol integrating VR, electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the brain mechanisms of this emotion.Methods A group of bioengineers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and philosophers designed the SUBRAIN study, a single-center, one-harm, non-randomized interventional study to explore the neural processes underlying awe experiences. The study will be performed on fifty adults. The experimental protocol includes different steps: (i) screening, (ii) enrollment, (iii) pre-experimental assessment, (iv) VR experimental assessment, and (v) post-experimental debriefing. The brain’s electrical activity is recorded using the EEG while participants navigated three immersive awe-inducing VR environments (VREs) and a neutral one. At the same time, the cortical excitability and connectivity is investigated by performing a TMS-EEG session right after each VR navigation. Along with cerebral signals, self-reported questionnaires were used to assess the VR-induced changes in the emotional state of the subjects. This data is then analyzed to delve into the cerebral mechanisms of awe.Discussion This study protocol is the first one that tries to fully understand the neural bases of awe by eliciting and studying this phenomenon in VR. The pairing of awe-inducing VR experiences and questionnaires investigating participants’ affect and emotions, with non-invasive neural techniques, can provide a novel and extensive knowledge on this complex phenomenon. The protocol can inform on the combination of different instruments showing a reproducible and reliable setting for the investigation of induced complex emotions."

This limitation can lead to an oversight of the pathological mechanisms of AD and suboptimal performance in AD diagnosis. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a novel stage-aware brain graph learning model. Particularly, we analyze the different brain patterns of each AD stage in terms of stage-specific brain graphs. We design a Stage Feature-enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning method, named SF-GCL, utilizing specific features within each AD stage to perform graph augmentation, thereby effectively capturing differences between stages. Significantly, this study unveils the specific brain patterns corresponding to each AD stage, showing great potential in tracing the trajectory of brain degeneration. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of our model."

We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate rates of psychotic experiences, clinical high-risk for psychosis syndrome (CHR-P), and psychotic disorders identified by screening treatment-seeking individuals to inform implementation recommendations for routine psychosis screening in general psychiatric settings.Methods PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify empirical studies that contained information on the point prevalence of psychotic experiences, CHR-P, or psychotic disorders identified by screening inpatient and outpatient samples aged 12-64 receiving general psychiatric care. Psychotic experiences were identified by meeting threshold scores on validated self-reported questionnaires, and psychotic disorders and CHR-P by gold-standard structured interview assessments. A meta-analysis of each outcome was conducted using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimator method of estimating effect sizes in a random effects model.Results 41 independent samples (k=36 outpatient) involving n=25,751 patients (58% female, mean age: 24.1 years) were included. Among a general psychiatric population, prevalence of psychotic experiences was 44.3% (95% CI: 35.8-52.8%; 28 samples, n=21,957); CHR-P was 26.4% (95% CI: 20.0-32.7%; 28 samples, n=14,395); and psychotic disorders was 6.6% (95% CI: 3.3-9.8%; 32 samples, n=20,371).Conclusions High rates of psychotic spectrum illness in general psychiatric settings underscore need for secondary prevention with psychosis screening. These base rates can be used to plan training and resources required to conduct assessments for early detection, as well as build capacity in interventions for CHR-P and early psychosis in non-specialty mental health settings."

MSI status can have an influence on therapy decisions centered on immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this study a novel droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) kit for MSI status determination was validated across 2 separate CRC patient cohorts: 102 tumor samples from the ALGECOLS cohort and 129 plasma samples from the RASANC cohort. Each cohort was assessed for MSI status using the novel ddPCR kit and compared to historical and/or newly obtained results, (either immunohistochemistry analysis or PCR amplification). Concordance between ddPCR and conventional MSI determination methods for the analysis of tissue samples was 97.1% for ALGECOLS. When looking at positive ctDNA samples, a strong concordance was observed for the RASANC cohort. This study illustrates that ddPCR MSI testing represents a rapid, sensitive and accurate method with a strong correlation to established methods. Moreover, the ability of the described approach to monitor MSI status in both tumor and plasma enhances the potential for the use of MSI status in longitudinal monitoring of CRC patients."

It is associated with cardiovascular diseases and severe complications like aortic aneurysms and dissection. We aim to assess qualitatively and quantitatively explainable methods in order to understand the decisions of a deep learning model for Aortic Elongation detection with Chest X-Ray (CXR) images.Methods and Results In this work, we evaluated the performance of deep learning models (DenseNet and EfficientNet) for aortic elongation detection based on transfer learning and fine-tunning techniques using CXR as input. DenseNet achieved higher accuracy (84.7% ± 0.7), precision (75.6% ± 1.3), sensitivity (88.7% ± 2.7), specificity (82.3% ± 1.6), F1-score (81.6% ± 1.0), and AUROC (93.1% ± 0.4) than EfficientNet. To gain insights into the decision-making process of the deep learning models, we employed Grad-CAM and LIME explainability methods. Through these techniques, we were able to successfully identify the expected location of aortic elongation in the x-ray images. Moreover, we used the pixel-flipping method to assess quantitatively the interpretations providing valuable insights into models behavior.Conclusion Our study presents a comprehensive strategy for analyzing CXR by integrating Aortic Elongation detection models with explainable methods. By incorporating explainable AI techniques, we enhanced the interpretability and understanding of the models’ decisions. This approach holds promise for aiding clinicians in timely and accurate diagnosis, potentially improving patient outcomes in clinical practice."

Resolving a polyclonal antibody repertoire across a pathogen’s proteome to specific epitopes may therefore explain much of the heterogeneity in susceptibility to infectious disease. However, the three-dimensional nature of antibody-epitope interactions makes the discovery of non-obvious targets challenging. We implemented a novel computational method and synthetic biology pipeline for identifying epitopes that are functionally important in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identified an IgM-dominant response to an exposed Membrane protein epitope which to our knowledge is the strongest correlate of severe disease identified to date (adjusted OR 72.14, 95% CI: 9.71 – 1300.15), stronger even than the exponential association of severe disease with age. We also identify persistence (> 2 years) of this IgM response in individuals with longCOVID, and a correlation with fatigue and depression symptom burden. The repetitive arrangement of this epitope and the pattern of isotype class switching is consistent with this being a previously unrecognized T independent antigen. These findings point to a coronavirus host-pathogen interaction characteristic of severe virus driven immune pathology. This epitope is a promising vaccine and therapeutic target as it is highly conserved through SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution in humans to date and in related coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV), showing far less evolutionary plasticity than targets on the Spike protein. This provides a promising biomarker for longCOVID and a target to complement Spike-directed vaccination which could broaden humoral protection from severe or persistent disease or novel coronavirus spillovers.One-Sentence Summary Using a novel protein-structure-based B cell epitope discovery method with a wide range of possible applications, we have identified a simple to measure host-pathogen antibody signature associated with severe COVID-19 and longCOVID and suggest the viral Membrane protein contains an epitope that acts as a T independent antigen during infection triggering extrafollicular B cell activation."

This study addresses the urgent need for early lung cancer detection using deep learning models applied to computed tomography (CT) images.Methods Our study introduced a unique non-cancer pneumonia dataset, a publicly available large-scale collection of high-quality pneumonia CT scans with detailed descriptions. We utilized this dataset to fine-tune nine pretrained models, including DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, VGG19, and Xception for the classification of lung cancer and pneumonia.Results ResNet50 demonstrated the highest accuracy and sensitivity (97.7% and 100%, respectively), while InceptionV3 excelled in precision (97.9%) and specificity (98.0%). The study also highlighted the contribution of the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technique in examining the effectiveness of the model-training process via the visualization of features learned across different layers. Grad-CAM revealed that among the best-performed models, InceptionV3 successfully identified cancerous lesions in CT scans.

They experience unique social and interpersonal challenges that contribute to relatively unmet health care needs thereby increasing their risk of acquiring HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). With research pertaining to oral health of transgender women being sparse in literature, this study aimed to understand their experiences by exploring the barriers and enablers of oral health care utilization as well as safe sexual behaviour relating to oral transmission of STIs among Transgender women.Methods Semi structured in-depth interviews (n=20) with a group of urban dwelling transgender women (mean age= 39.8 years) in Northern Malaysia and Focus group discussion (n=7) with key informants was conducted to gain insights into the needs of the community. Participants were recruited through a snow-balling method of sampling with the help of transgender women community workers. The data obtained was coded and transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis to interpret and derive major themes and subthemes. Community advocates were involved in planning of the study.Results All of participants reported experiencing high levels of stigma and discrimination in daily life. Routine engagement in oral sex practices (100%, n=20) was reported with multiple partners (60%, n=12) with a perceived low level of risk of transmission of STIs through this practice (80%, n=16). Nighty percent (n=18) never used barriers or inconsistently used them during oral sexual practices. Additionally, low utilization of dental services was reported with 80% (n=16) not having visited a dentist in the past 12 months or seeking self-medication or unprofessional care. The themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis were key to understanding the experiences of the community.Conclusion The results identified gaps in awareness of oral transmission of STIs among the transgender women. The importance of social support in positively influencing health promotion as well as improving health care and dental care utilization was highlighted. The development of an educational intervention is proposed as an instrument to address these gaps and provide support."

Therefore, a thorough understanding of the patient’s needs and concerns is crucial to implementing satisfactory pain outcomes. This study aims to explore the needs and concerns of patients with cancer pain in Sri Lanka.Methods This study employed a descriptive qualitative approach among purposively selected patients with cancer and registered at the pain management unit. Patients eighteen years older with cancer-related pain were recruited. Noncancerous pain and those with psychological disorders, and brain metastases were excluded. Twenty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted until data saturation using a semi-structured interview guide, each lasting 30-60 minutes. Data were analyzed by Graneheim and Lundman’s content analysis method.Results The study primarily involved participants aged 51-60 Sinhalese Buddhists. It highlighted two main themes: ‘Changes in normal lifestyle’ and ‘Needs and expectations’. The ‘Changes in normal lifestyle’ theme included subthemes like ‘Functional limitations’, ‘Emotional reactions’, ‘altered interpersonal relationships’, and ‘Socio-financial problems’. The ‘Needs and expectations’ theme covered desires for a ‘Pain-free life’, a return to a ‘Normal lifestyle’, and the ‘Need for a caregiver’. The findings emphasize that the most significant issue for cancer patients is the disruption to their normal lifestyle due to various challenges, while their primary need is to live without pain.Conclusions ‘Life without pain’ is a cancer sufferer’s greatest need while ‘changes in normal lifestyle’ owing to bio-psycho-social-spiritual problems is their primary concern."

This study aimed to compare the volumes of in-person visits and to explore the experiences of healthcare providers and users regarding the continuity of healthcare in the maternity ward of a Health and Social Promotion Center (HSPC) before, during and after the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.Methods We conducted a multimethod, cross-sectional exploratory study with a phenomenological approach. Monthly health administrative data regarding family planning visits, antenatal visits, deliveries, and postnatal care before, during, and after COVID-19 were collected and compared. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with family healthcare providers and users and thematically analyzed.Results The study found that the pandemic led to a decline in the demand for healthcare, as people were afraid of contracting COVID-19. This was particularly true for pregnant women who had recently given birth. The study also found that the pandemic disrupted the supply of essential medicines and medical supplies, which made it difficult for healthcare providers to provide quality care.The qualitative analysis allowed us to highlight three themes: the representation of respondents on COVID-19, their perception of the effectiveness of barrier measures and their analysis of the continuity of care in times of COVID-19: the picture of respondents on COVID-19, their perception of the efficacy of barrier measures and their analysis of the continuity of care in times of COVID-19. Despite these challenges, the study found that healthcare providers and users could find ways to maintain continuity of care.Conclusion The study concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the continuity of maternity care in Burkina Faso. However, healthcare providers and users have found ways to maintain continuity of care, and the study provides recommendations for improving continuity of care in the future."

However, complying with all requirements and professional expectations while maintaining the necessary scientific and ethical standards can be challenging for applicants and members of the REC alike. There is a need for accessible guidelines and resources to help medical researchers and REC members navigate the legal and ethical requirements and the process of their review.Methods We employed an explorative search for resources on the websites of a purposively selected sample of relevant stakeholders including 12 national umbrella organizations (six German-language and six English-language), three English-language international umbrella organizations, and 16 national REC’s of major university hospitals (eight German- and eight English-language). We qualitatively mapped the identified resources onto the guiding principles of ethical clinical research and 35 related checkpoints. To describe the content of the resources we conducted a thematic analysis.Results We extracted a total of 233 resources, including templates (n = 134, 58.5%), guidelines/recommendations (n = 62, 26.6%), checklists (n = 23, 9.9%), tools (n = 5, 2.2%), flowcharts (n = 5, 2.2%), glossaries (n = 3, 1.3%), and one (0.4%) software program. We extracted 101 German and 132 English resources created between 2004 and 2023. The majority (n = 204; 87.6%) could be assigned to one checkpoint. The remaining 29 (12.5%) resources were considered unspecific (e.g., a checklist which documents to be submitted for a German drug trial). The specific resources are discussed per checkpoint.Conclusion While much support is available for some aspects such as participant information and informed consent forms, it is lacking in other areas such as study design, analysis, and biometrics. More support should be provided in these areas to ensure that research projects are methodologically sound. A more detailed analysis of the quality of available resources could help identify other areas of need."

However, challenges still remain for automated variant interpretation and candidate shortlisting. For instance, reliability is affected by variability in input data caused by different sequencing platforms, erroneous nomenclature and changing experimental conditions. Similarly, differences in predictive algorithms could result in discordant results and scalability is essential to accommodate large amounts of input data, such as Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). To accelerate causal variant detection and innovation in genome diagnostics and research, we developed the MOLGENIS Variant Interpretation Pipeline (VIP). VIP is a flexible and open-source computational pipeline to generate interactive reports of variants in Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and WGS data for expert interpretation. VIP is applicable to short- and long-read data from different platforms and offers tools for increased sensitivity. For this purpose, a configurable decision tree, filters based on Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and gene inheritance can be used to pinpoint disease-causing variants or to finetune a query for specific variants. Additionally, we present a step-by-step protocol describing how to use VIP to annotate, classify and filter genetic variants of patients with a rare disease that has a suspected genetic cause. Finally, we demonstrate how VIP performs using 25,664 previously classified variants from the Data Sharing initiative of the Vereniging van Klinisch Genetische Laboratoriumdiagnostiek (VKGL), a cohort of 18 patients from routine diagnostics and a cohort of 41 patients with a rare diseases (RD) that were not diagnosed in routine diagnostics but were solved within the EU wide project to solve rare diseases (EU-Solve-RD) using novel omics approaches. The protocol requires bioinformatic knowledge to configure and afterwards every diagnostic professional is able to perform an analysis within 5 hours."

To determine if there was any specific tongue coating feature in COVID-19, this study investigated the difference in tongue coating between COVID-19 subjects and subjects with other acute inflammatory diseases characterized by fever. Tongue images taken with smartphones from three age-matched groups, namely, COVID group (n=92), non-COVID febrile group (n=92), and normal control group (n=92), were analyzed by two blinded raters according to a tongue coating scoring scheme, which assessed the levels of thick fur, slimy or greasy fur, discolored fur and composite index of tongue coating. Compared with control, significant increases in all coating indexes were found in the COVID group (P<0.001), as well as in the non-COVID febrile group (P<0.001). However, no difference was observed between COVID and non-COVID febrile groups for all coating indexes measured. In COVID-19 subjects, their scores of coating indexes had weak but significant correlations with certain inflammatory biomarkers, including WBC and neutrophil - lymphocyte ratio. It is concluded that COVID-19 subjects have pathological tongue coating patterns that are associated with inflammatory responses, and these coating patterns can help to indicate the direction of disease development."

However, while much is known about the disease risks of high-dose irradiation, risk estimates at low dose remains controversial. To date, five different parametric models (supra-linear, linear no threshold, threshold, quadratic, and hormesis) for low doses have been studied in the literature. Different dose-response models may lead to inconsistent or even conflicting results.In this manuscript, we introduce a data-driven deep neural network (DNN) model designed to evaluate dose-response models at low doses using Life Span Study (LSS) data. DNNs possess the capability to approximate any continuous function with an adequate number of nodes in the hidden layers. Being data-driven, they circumvent the challenges associated with misspecification inherent in parametric models. Our simulation study highlights the effectiveness of DNNs as a valuable tool for precisely identifying dose-response models from available data. New findings from the LSS study provide robust support for a linear quadratic (LQ) dose-response model at low doses.While the linear no threshold (LNT) model tends to overestimate disease risk at very low doses and underestimate health risk at relatively high doses, it remains a reasonable approximation for the LQ model, given the minor impact of the quadratic term at low doses. Our demonstration underscores the power of DNNs in facilitating comprehensive investigations into dose-response associations."

This study aims to enhance the predictive performance of models for congenital syphilis prediction by incorporating additional information obtained during gestational follow-up. Building upon the work of Teixeira et al. [1], which utilizes clinical and sociodemographic data, our model was enriched with results from venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and rapid tests for congenital syphilis conducted on pregnant women.Method The dataset utilized in this study comprised 47,604 records spanning the period from 2013 to 2022, with 27 attributes collected from pregnant women enrolled in the Mãe Coruja Pernambucana Program in Pernambuco, Brazil. Among these attributes, we included clinical and sociodemographic factors, as well as results from venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and rapid tests for congenital syphilis.Results Our proposed model surpassed Teixeira’s models exhibiting higher specificity (94.74%) and a slight increase in sensitivity (70.37%).Conclusions Our study highlights the value of incorporating additional information from VDRL and rapid tests into models for predicting congenital syphilis. The combined approach involving both clinical, sociodemographic, and test result data enhances the accuracy of predictions thereby facilitating better informed healthcare decisions at different stages of pregnancy. This approach also holds significant potential in combating and managing congenital syphilis by providing assistance to health system decision makers and public policymakers. As a result, it can ultimately enhance the overall outcomes of maternal and child health and contribute to disease control."

In humans, brucellosis is almost always originating from animals. Current literature provides scant data regarding the seroprevalence of brucellosis in South Sudan. This cross-sectional study investigates the seroprevalence of brucellosis among the pastoral community and livestock and identifies risk factors for the disease from two counties, Terekeka and Juba in Central Equatoria State (CES), South Sudan.Methodology A total of 986 serum samples from humans (n=143), cattle (n=478), sheep (n=86), and goats (n=279) were randomly collected from 17 livestock camps in CES. Serum samples for the humans, cattle and goats were screened for Brucella-specific antibodies using rose Bengal plate test (RBPT) and further confirmed by competitive enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (c-ELISA) in series. All the sera from sheep were tested in parallel using RBPT and c-ELISA. A camp was considered positive when at least one animal of either species tested positive on the c-ELISA. Univariate analysis using binary logistic regression with a confidence interval of 95% at a p-value of ≤ 0.05 was used to identify the association between the potential individual risk factors and Brucella seropositivity. The investigated risk factors for livestock included age, sex, species, prior abortion history, retained placenta, parity, and reproductive status. Variables found to have associations in univariate analysis (p =0.25) with Brucella seropositivity were further included in multivariable logistic regression. The risk factors investigated for humans included, gender, age, educational level, occupation, marital status, drinking of raw milk, aiding female animals during delivery, eating of undercooked meat and blowing of air into the cow’s uterus through the vagina.Results The study revealed seroprevalence of 21.7%, 11.8%, and 4.8% in cattle, goats, and humans, respectively. Our results indicated that all sheep serum samples were negative on both RBPT and c-ELISA. The seroprevalence in the 13 camps from TerekekaCounty was 100% (13/13) compared to 50% (2/4) seropositive from 4 camps in Juba County. All the variables investigated in the univariate analysis of risk factors in cattle were significantly associated with Brucella seropositivity: sex (OR:4.5, 95% CI: 2.2 – 8.9, p:<0.001), age (OR:6.6, 95% CI: 2.3 –19.1, p:<0.001), abortion history(OR:3.1, 95% CI: 1.8 – 5.2, p:<0.001), retained placenta (OR:2.5, 95% CI: 1.4 – 4.4, p: 0.001),parity (OR:2.3, 95% CI: 1.1 – 4.7, p:0.020). However, in small ruminants, none of the potential risk factors were associated with Brucella seropositivity. In humans, blowing air through cow’s vagina (OR: 1.4, 95%CI: 0.782 – 2.434, p: 0.035) was the only variable found to be significantly associated with Brucella seropositivity at the univariate analysis. The forceful blowing of air into cow’s vagina to induce milk is a common practice among the pastoral communities in South Sudan.The multivariable logistic regression model identified sex, age, and abortion history as statistically significant factors for Brucella seropositivity in cattle. The odds of seropositivity were nearly threefold (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.3 – 5.8, p: 0.006) higher in cows compared to bulls (male cattle). Cattle over two years old had higher odds of Brucella seropositivity than young animals (OR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.2 – 10.3-, p: 0.025). Cows with a history of abortion had higher odds of Brucella seropositivity (OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.6 – 4.7, p: <0.001).Conclusion This is the first study to report occurrence of brucellosis in goats and its absence in sheep in South Sudan. Altogether, our results suggest that Brucella abortus infecting primarily cattle has spilled over to goats but not (yet) to sheep. The present study also shows occurrence of brucellosis in cattle, goats and people in the pastoral community and recommends implementation of One Health approach for effective mitigation of this disease.Author summary Brucellosis is a neglected, bacterial zoonotic disease that is caused by several species of the genus Brucella. Cross-species transmission of Brucella can occur in mixed or integrated farming systems. The disease poses serious public health implications and substantial economic losses particularly in low-income countries including South Sudan.This study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in pastoralists, their livestock as well identifying potential risk factors associated with Brucella infection. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of brucellosis and risk factors is a prerequisite towards planning an effective mitigation strategy of the disease.The study revealed high seroprevalence of brucellosis in cattle compared to goats, and the following risk factors were identified; prior history of abortion, age (old) and sex (female) significantly associated with Brucella infection. Surprisingly, sheep were found to be seronegative."

Commercially available devices provide multiple therapy modes involving a different combination of frequency and pulse width with intensity. While frequency sets sensation, intensity helps determine tolerability, longer pulse width is reported to induce a feeling of deeper stimulation. In fact, longer pulse width has been empirically shown to deliver current into deeper tissues, but in context of other electrical stimulation modalities. The goal of this study was to unpack the relationship between pulse width and activation depth in TENS.Methods A highly realistic, anatomically-based, 3D finite element model of the forearm was used to simulate the electric field (E-field) distribution, as the pulse width is varied. A typical titration-guided mechanism was used to obtain the strength-duration (S-D) curves of a sensory McIntyre-Richardson-Grill (MRG) axonal model simulating the pain-transmitting A-delta fibers. The pulse widths tested ranged from 30 μs to 495 μs.Results As expected, shorter pulse widths required more current to achieve activation, resulting in a larger E- field. The S-D curve of the target median nerve indicates a rheobase of 1.75 mA and a chronaxie of 232 µsec. When the applied currents are the same, shorter pulse widths result in a smaller volume of tissue activated (VTA) compared to the longer pulse widths. A 21 fold difference in VTA was found between the longest and shortest pulse widths considered. We observed a linear relationship between pulse width and activation depth for the conditions tested in the study.Conclusion Our findings highlight the impact of pulse width on activation depth. While choice of a given therapy mode is usually based on an ad-hoc desirable sensation basis, medical professionals may consider advocating a certain therapy mode based on the depth of the intended target nerve."

It has been used in humans in combination with the antibiotic imipenem to prevent imipenem’s degradation. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the nephroprotective effects of cilastatin in humans.Study Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational (comparative effectiveness) studies or randomized clinical trials (RCTs)Setting & Study Populations People of any age at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).Selection Criteria for Studies We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials registry from database inception to November 2023 for observational studies or RCTs that compared kidney outcomes among groups treated with cilastatin, either alone or as combination imipenem-cilastatin, versus an inactive or active control group not treated with cilastatin.Data Extraction Two reviewers independently evaluated studies for inclusionand risk of bias.Analytical Approach Treatment effects were estimated using random effects models and heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic.Results We identified 10 studies (five RCTs, n=531 patients; 5 observational studies, n=6,321 participants) that met the inclusion criteria, including 6 studies with comparisons of imipenem-cilastatin to an inactive control and 4 studies with comparisons to alternate antibiotics. Based on pooled results from 5 studies, the risk of AKI was lower with imipenem-cilastatin (risk ratio [RR] 0.53 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.74]; I2=42.2%), with consistent results observed from randomized trials (two trials, RR 0.30 [95% CI, 0.09 to 1.00]; I2=62.8%) and observational studies (three studies, RR 0.55 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.81]; I2=62.8%). Based on results from six studies, kidney function was also better with imipenem-cilastatin than comparators (weighted mean difference [WMD] in serum creatinine -0.14 mg/dL [95% CI, -0.21 to -0.07]; I2=0%). The overall certainty of the evidence was low due to heterogeneity of the results, high risk of bias, and indirectness among the identified studies.Limitations Clinical and statistical heterogeneity could not be fully explained due to a limited number of studies.Conclusion Patients treated with imipenem-cilastatin developed AKI less frequently and had better short-term kidney function than control groups or those receiving comparator antibiotics. Larger clinical trials with less risk of detection bias due to lack of allocation concealment and blinding are needed to establish the efficacy of cilastatin for AKI prevention.Registration International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (ID: CRD42023488809)"

To fully understand the complexity of a specific event and its associated clinical consequences, it is imperative to locate the breakpoint junctions and to resolve the derivative chromosome structure. This task, however, often surpasses the capabilities of conventional short-read sequencing technologies. In contrast, emerging long-read sequencing techniques present a compelling alternative for clinical diagnostics.Methods Here, the Genomic Medicine Sweden Rare Diseases (GMS-RD) consortium explored the utility of HiFi Revio long-read whole genome sequencing (lrGS) for clinical digital karyotyping of SVs nationwide. The first 16 samples included in this study were collected from all health care regions in Sweden. We established a national pipeline and a shared variant database for variant calling and filtering. The included validation samples cover a spectrum of simple and complex SVs including inversions, translocations and copy number variants.Results The results from the lrGS analysis match the reported karyotype for 14/16 individuals and 12 known SVs were mapped at nucleotide resolution. A complex rearrangement on chromosome 15 was identified only through read depth analysis and two chromosome 21 rearrangements remained undetected, one of which was mosaic. The average read length ranged from 8.3-18.8 kb and the coverage was >20x for all samples. De novo assembly resulted in a limited number of contigs per individual (N50 range 6-86 Mb) clearly separating the two alleles in most cases, enabling direct characterization of the chromosomal rearrangements.Conclusions In a national pilot study, we successfully demonstrated the utility of HiFi Revio lrGS as a clinical analysis of chromosomal rearrangements. Based on our results we propose a five-year plan for the wider implementation of lrGS for rare disease diagnostics in Sweden."

Our study aimed to address the question of whether in adult patients of acute ischemic stroke(AIS) who undergo EVT does an intensive SBP control as compared to a less intensive SBP control/conventional control up to 24 hours post procedure lead to a good functional outcomes defined by modified Rankin score(mRS) of 0-2 at 90days.Methods This PRISMA guidelines were followed for this review. Databases(PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, Google Scholar and Web of Science) were searched for English language articles using predefined search terms till Sep 15 2023. The inclusion criteria consisted of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies(at least total 20patients) analysing intensive vs conventional SBP control in AIS due to LVO post-EVT up to 24hours. Studies without a separate comparison primary outcome data, comparing SBP control in AIS due to LVO treated only with IV thrombolysis (IVT) without EVT, case series and case reports were excluded. The primary outcome was the rate of functional independence defined by mRS 0-2 at 90days. Risk of bias was assessed using the New Castle Ottawa scale(NOS) for observational studies, and the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias 2 (ROB2) tool for RCTs.Results Twelve studies(n=5439 patients-eight observational and four RCTs) were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was not significantly different between both the arms(RR:1.16;95%CI-0.98-1.37;p=0.08).There were no significant differences in the mortality at 90days(RR:0.83;95%CI-0.68-1.02;p=0.08) and the risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage(RR:0.84;95%CI-0.61-1.16;p=0.29). Fewer patients required decompressive surgery in the intensive arm(RR-0.40; 95%CI-0.25-0.66; p=0.0003). A separate analysis for the primary outcome from pooled observational data favoured intensive control(RR-1.34;95%CI-1.20-1.48; p<0.00001) and data from RCTs favoured conventional control(RR-0.82;95%CI-0.72-0.93;p=0.003).Conclusion Neither intensive nor conventional SBP control resulted in better functional outcome in the combined analysis of all studies. Although, observational studies favoured intensive control, data from RCTs suggested conventional management as the preferred approach which could currently be a pragmatic strategy. Further ongoing RCTs using homogenous SBP cut-offs will provide more clarity on the ideal SBP target after EVT."

The induced cortical plasticity is imperative in the recovery of motor and sensory functions. Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes damage to neurons and results in sensorimotor dysfunction. The effect of iTBS on recovery of motor and sensory dysfunction in complete SCI (cSCI) is still elusive.AIM This study aims to assess the effect of iTBS on cortico-spinal tract integrity, plasticity, and regaining of motor and sensory function in cSCI patients. The rationale behind using an iTBS protocol is to modify and augment the communication between spared neurons of the cortico-spinal tract and strengthen the synaptic transmission, which will improve motor function in underlying muscles.Method A total of 48 patients will be recruited and randomly divided into placebo and real stimulation groups. iTBS along with a rehabilitation program will be administered to the placebo and real stimulation groups. Follow-up will be done at 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after the intervention.Result The outcome of the study will be defined by electrophysiological parameters elicited by single and paired-pulse stimulation, ASIA score, pain, activities of daily life, quality of life, anxiety, depression, and biomarkers related to SCI. The results of this study will uncover the effectiveness of iTBS stimulation on (i) recovery of motor and sensory function in cSCI (ii) excitability of cortico-spinal tract (iii) neurological recovery and modulation of pain (iv) cortical reorganization after injury.Conclusion Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) in conjunction with an individualized rehabilitation program may serve as an integrated strategy to rejuvenate locomotor abilities and improve the overall quality of life for people with complete spinal cord injuries (SCI).Key PointsiTBS is a novel neurostimulation technique aimed to restore sensorimotor function after a complete SCIThe primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of iTBS in promoting sensorimotor function recoveryAssessment of the potential impact of iTBS on SCI rehabilitationUnderstand the underlying mechanism of excitatory-inhibitory circuits associated with SCIUnlock the importance of neuronal plasticity in regaining mobility"

Artificial intelligence, particularly large language models like GPT-4, presents a promising avenue for improving guideline adherence in diabetes care. Such technologies could revolutionize patient management by offering personalized, evidence-based treatment recommendations.Methods A comparative, blinded design was employed, involving 50 hypothetical diabetes mellitus case summaries, emphasizing varied aspects of diabetes management. GPT-4 evaluated each summary for guideline adherence, classifying them as compliant or non-compliant, based on the ADA guidelines. A medical expert, blinded to GPT-4’s assessments, independently reviewed the summaries. Concordance between GPT-4 and the expert’s evaluations was statistically analyzed, including calculating Cohen’s kappa for agreement.Results GPT-4 labelled 30 summaries as compliant and 20 as non-compliant, while the expert identified 28 as compliant and 22 as non-compliant. Agreement was reached on 46 of the 50 cases, yielding a Cohen’s kappa of 0.84, indicating near-perfect agreement. GPT-4 demonstrated a 92% accuracy, with a sensitivity of 86.4% and a specificity of 96.4%. Discrepancies in four cases highlighted challenges in AI’s understanding of complex clinical judgments related to medication adjustments and treatment modifications.Conclusion GPT-4 exhibits promising potential to support health-care professionals in reviewing diabetes management plans for guideline adherence. Despite high concordance with expert assessments, instances of non-agreement underscore the need for AI refinement in complex clinical scenarios. Future research should aim at enhancing AI’s clinical reasoning capabilities and exploring its integration with other technologies for improved healthcare delivery."

Logistic regression and Cox regression were used to assess associations of condition with outcome (mortality). Propensity score matching (1:1) was used to identify the comparison cases.Setting One tertiary care centre in sparsely populated northern SwedenParticipants Critical care cases undergoing emergent fixed-wing air transport in the northern healthcare region of Sweden was included. 2143 cases were included in the study between 2000-2016.Primary and secondary outcomes measures The primary outcome was mortality risk at 90-days post transport in cases with atrial fibrillation during the fixed-wing air ambulance transport. The secondary outcome measures were vasopressor and impaired oxygenation was associated with mortality at 90-days post transport.Results Atrial fibrillation showed a higher 90-day post transport mortality risk estimate in the multivariate analysis of all cases, hazard ratio (HR) 1.70 (95% CI 1.08-2.67, p=0.022). In a propensity matched analysis, no increased mortality risk for atrial fibrillation was observed at the same time interval with hazard ratio 1.22 (0.65-2.27, p=0.536). In the secondary analysis, vasopressor use was associated with atrial fibrillation at the time of transport whereas impaired oxygenation was not associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.Conclusion No increased mortality risk at 90 days was seen for cases with atrial fibrillation at time of transport in this cohort using a propensity score matched approach.Strengths and limitationsExplores the scarcely studied topic of mortality risk and atrial fibrillation at time of transport with fixed-wing air ambulanceQuasi-experimental approach with propensity score matching to handle selection biasNo co-morbidity and disease severity data which risk confounding resultsA single transport system was studied which limits generalizability"

Folate receptor alpha (FOLR1/FRα)-targeting agents have shown promise both alone and in combination with available therapies, but the relationship of FRα to other treatment-driving biomarkers is unknown. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was queried to assess protein and mRNA expression and mutational burden in patients with differential FRα protein-expressing ovarian tumors, and the results referenced against the standard 324 mutations currently tested through FoundationOne Companion Diagnostics to identify targets of interest. Of 585 samples within TCGA, 121 patients with serous ovarian tumors for whom FRα protein expression was quantified were identified. FRα protein expression significantly correlated with FOLR1 mRNA expression (p=7.19×10- 14). Progression free survival (PFS) for the FRα-high group (Q1) was 20.7 months, compared to 16.6 months for the FRα-low group (Q4, Logrank, p=0.886). Overall survival (OS) was 54.1 months versus 36.3 months, respectively; however, this result was not significant (Q1 vs. Q4, Logrank, p=0.200). Mutations more commonly encountered in patients with high FRα-expressing tumors included PIK3CA and FGF family proteins. Combinations of FRα-targeting agents with PI3K, mTOR, FGF(R) and VEGF inhibitors warrant investigation to evaluate their therapeutic potential.Simple Summary Epithelial ovarian cancer can be highly lethal, with limited therapeutic options for patients without BRCA mutations or non-homologous recombination deficient disease. Folate receptor alpha (FRα)-targeting agents have shown promise in the setting of platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, both alone and in combination with available therapies, but the relationship of FRα to other treatment-driving biomarkers is unknown.

However, the extent of their performance when utilizing radiological images and providing differential diagnoses has yet to be investigated.Purpose We employed the latest version of Claude 3, Opus, released on March 4, 2024, to investigate its diagnostic performance in answering Radiology’s Diagnosis Please quiz questions under three conditions: (1) when provided with clinical history alone; (2) when given clinical history along with imaging findings; and (3) when supplied with clinical history and key images.Furthermore, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of the model when instructed to list differential diagnoses.Materials and Methods Claude 3 Opus was tasked with listing the primary diagnosis and two differential diagnoses for 322 quiz questions from Radiology’s “Diagnosis Please” cases, which included cases 1 to 322, published from 1998 to 2023. The analyses were carried out under the following input conditions:Condition 1: Submitter-provided clinical history (text) aloneCondition 2: Submitter-provided clinical history and imaging findings (text) Condition 3: Submitter-provided clinical history (text) and key images (PDF files)We applied McNemar’s tests to evaluate differences in correct response rates for primary diagnoses across Conditions 1, 2, and 3.Results The correct primary diagnoses rates were 62/322 (19.3%), 178/322 (55.3%), and 93/322 (28.8%) for Conditions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Additionally, Claude 3 Opus accurately provided the correct answer as a differential diagnosis in up to 22/322 (6.8%) of cases. There were statistically significant differences in correct response rates for primary diagnoses between all combinations of Conditions 1, 2, and 3 (p<0.001).Conclusion Claude 3 Opus demonstrated significantly improved diagnostic performance by inputting key images in addition to clinical history. The ability to list important differential diagnoses was also confirmed.Key ResultsThis study investigated Claude 3 Opus’s performance in Radiology Diagnosis Please Cases using clinical history, key images, and imaging findings.Key images or imaging findings inputs significantly improved correct primary diagnoses from 19.3% to 28.8% or 55.5%, respectively.By having two additional differential diagnoses presented, total correct responses improved by 3.1–6.8%.Summary statement Large language AI model Claude 3 Opus demonstrated significantly improved diagnostic accuracy by adding key images with clinical history compared with clinical history alone."

Moreover, SSc foot involvement is frequent but poorly investigated. We aimed to provide a detailed characterization of foot peripheral neuropathy in a large cohort of SSc patients, describing its associations with disease-specific features, physical disability and Quality of Life (QoL).Methods SSc patients and healthy controls (HC) comparable for age and gender, were enrolled in a cross-sectional observational case-control study. All subjects underwent a detailed quantitative sensory testing (QST) of feet evaluating touch, vibratory, thermal, and pain sensitivity; ultimately investigating the presence of large and small fiber neuropathy. Neuroptahtic symptoms were captured through a numerical rating scale assessing the presence of paraesthesia, numbness, burning, and stabbing pain. While the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index (MFPDI), SSc Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and the Systemic Sclerosis Quality of Life (SScQoL) needs-based questionnaire were used to capture the impact of the PSN on foot disability and QoL.Results 109 SSc patients (88.1% female, median age 59.0 years) and 51 HC were enrolled. SSc patients presented with a significant median reduction of areas with preserved tactile sensitivity (14 IQR 4; p<0.001), and a delayed vibration perception threshold (1.7 µm IQR 3.0; p=0.01). Regarding thermoreceptor impairment, they presented with signifiantlly higer cold and warm thresholds (27.0 °C, IQR 3.0; vs 28.2 °C, p<0.001; 38.4 °C IQR 4.6, p=0.003 respectivelly), greater warm-cold threshold range (11.2 °C, IQR 6.9, p<0.001), and higher heat-induced pain threshold (44.8 °C, IQR 3.5; p<0.001),. At group level, 85.3% patients showed PSN on the feet, with 80% having small fibre involvement and 57% having large fiber neuropathy; while the coexistence of the two was present in 51.4% of the cases. Leaving only 14% without neuropathy. From those patients with PSN, 80.6% reported at least one neuropathic symptom, while 18% were asymptomatic. PSN was associated with age, smoking, foot ulceration,disease duration and corticosteroids use. Patients with neuropathic symptoms reported worse physical function, worse foot disability, and poorer QoL.Conclusion Foot PSN presents as common and disabling manifestation in patients with SSc, involving both large and small fibers, often co-existing. Clinically, the presence of neuropathic symptoms might serve as an indicator of PSN, although it can have a subclinical presentation. Hence, PSN assessment should be included as part of the workup of the SSc patient ."

We ascertained the first occurrence of CHD and performed a joint Cox multivariate regression to identify premorbid predictors for a fatal rather than a non-fatal incident event.Results A total of 10,714 incident CHD events including 513 fatal events accrued during follow up. A five-year increase in age, smoking 5 to 34 cigarettes per day, and a standard deviation (SD) increase in the Cornel voltage product on electrocardiography each independently increased the relative risk (RR) of dying from one’s initial presentation of CHD by 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35 to 58%), 30% (8 to 51%,), and 17% (7 to 28%), respectively. A high level of recreational physical activity (>1200 metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week) reduced one’s relative risk by 32% (12 to 49%). A significant dose-response effect was observed for both physical activity and smoking and the reduction in absolute risk of presenting with fatal CHD associated with a healthy lifestyle was roughly equivalent to the difference in risk observed among women separated in age by approximately 10 years.Conclusions Modifiable factors affect a post-menopausal woman’s risk of dying from her initial presentation of CHD. Our findings may reduce case-fatality rates of CHD by motivating individuals at risk to adopt and/or adhere to established primary prevention strategies.Clinical PerspectiveWhat Is New? Older age, smoking, and increased left ventricular mass as estimated by electrocardiography independently increase the risk of a fatal outcome with the initial presentation of CHD, while physical activity and the use of aspirin reduced that risk.What Are the Clinical Implications? Modifiable risk factors related to lifestyle not only protect against the occurrence of an initial presentation of CHD but also provide additional protection against a fatal outcome during that event."

For-profit private healthcare providers, catalytic for malaria elimination in many countries, have not yet been integrated into the national program. By imposing strict definitions on a large and complex literature surrounding private healthcare sector engagement, we distilled eight distinct strategies important in other developing settings: contracting, financing, subsidization, regulation, social franchising, demand-side interventions, infrastructure-building and training. We weighed these in the context of Bangladesh’s flourishing private health care sector—driven by patient demand, self-interest, and aspirations for public good—as well as the heterogeneity in provider capacity and malaria prevalence across districts. We developed a new model dependent on five strategies of subsidization, training, infrastructure building, demand-side intervention, and referral financing, to empower Bangladesh’s phased agenda of eliminating indigenous malaria transmission by 2030."

Machine learning has identified an association between right-sided precordial U waves and moderate to severe aortic stenosis. No study has explored the role of ECG screening by primary care physicians for patients with unknown aortic stenosis status.Methods A retrospective single center cohort analysis performed by non-cardiologists identified right-sided precordial U waves on ECGs in fifty adults ages 65 to 89. Following identification, reviewers were unblinded to echocardiograms to determine whether there was an association between right-sided precordial U waves and aortic stenosis severity. Fifty age- and gender-matched patients without right-sided precordial U waves comprised the control group.Results Chi-squared analysis revealed a significant association between right-sided precordial U waves and severity of aortic stenosis (χ2 = 16.77, df = 3, p < 0.001). Multinomial logistic regressions demonstrated no relationship between categorical SBP (< 125, 126 – 145, > 145) and aortic stenosis (p = 0.35), but increasing categorical age (65-73, 74-81, 82-89) was associated with moderate to severe aortic stenosis (p = 0.002).Conclusions Our data highlights right-sided precordial U wave identification by non-cardiologists as a novel objective adjunct to the physical examination in detection of a medical condition which portends significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. These findings motivate a prospective randomized clinical trial in the utility of right-sided precordial U waves in screening for aortic stenosis in primary care settings."

Vaccination has emerged as a crucial strategy in mitigating the impact of the disease. This study aims to estimate the number of deaths averted through vaccination in LAC during the first year and a half of vaccination rollout (January 2021 - May 2022).Methods Publicly available data on COVID-19 deaths and vaccination rates were used to estimate the total number of deaths averted via vaccination in LAC. Using estimates for number of deaths, number of vaccinated, and vaccine effectiveness, a counterfactual estimated number of deaths observed without vaccination was calculated. Vaccine effectiveness estimates were obtained from published studies. The analysis focused on 17 countries in LAC and considered adults aged 18 years and above.Findings After accounting for underreporting, the analysis estimated that over 1.49 million deaths were caused by COVID-19 in the selected countries during the study period. Without vaccination, the model estimated that between 2.10 and 4.11 million COVID-19 deaths would have occurred. Consequently, vaccination efforts resulted in approximately 610,000 to 2.61 million deaths averted.Interpretation This study represents the first large-scale, multi-center estimate of population-level vaccine impact on COVID-19 mortality in LAC. The findings underscore the substantial impact of timely and widespread vaccination in averting COVID-19 deaths. These results provide crucial support for vaccination programs aimed at combating epidemic infectious diseases in the region and future pandemics.Funding This study was funded by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO)."

Individuals with G6PD polymorphisms (variants) that produce an impaired G6PD enzyme are usually asymptomatic, but at risk of hemolytic anemia from oxidative stressors, including certain drugs and foods. Prevention of G6PD deficiency-related hemolytic anemia is achievable through G6PD genetic testing or whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify affected individuals who should avoid hemolytic triggers. However, accurately predicting the clinical consequence of G6PD variants is limited by over 800 G6PD variants which remain of uncertain significance. There also remains significant variability in which deficiency-causing variants are included in pharmacogenomic testing arrays across institutions: many panels only include c.202G>A, even though dozens of other variants can also cause G6PD deficiency. Here, we seek to improve G6PD genotype interpretation using data available in the All of Us Research Program and using a yeast functional assay. We confirm that G6PD coding variants are the main contributor to decreased G6PD activity, and that 13% of individuals in the All of Us data with deficiency-causing variants would be missed if only the c.202G>A variant were tested for. We expand clinical interpretation for G6PD variants of uncertain significance; reporting that c.595A>G, known as G6PD Dagua or G6PD Açores, and the newly identified variant c.430C>G, reduce activity sufficiently to lead to G6PD deficiency. We also provide evidence that five missense variants of uncertain significance are unlikely to lead to G6PD deficiency, since they were seen in hemi- or homozygous individuals without a reduction in G6PD activity. We also applied the new WHO guidelines and were able to classify two synonymous variants as WHO class C. We anticipate these results will improve the accuracy, and prompt increased use, of G6PD genetic tests through a more complete clinical interpretation of G6PD variants. As the All of Us data increases from 245,000 to 1 million participants, and additional functional assays are carried out, we expect this research to serve as a template to enable complete characterization of G6PD deficiency genotypes. With an increased number of interpreted variants, genetic testing of G6PD will be more informative for preemptively identifying individuals at risk for drug- or food-induced hemolytic anemia."

Facing the course of the COVID-19 pandemic to an endemic characterised by several SARS-CoV-2 virus variants of concern (VOC) and an increasing public COVID-19 vaccination rate the aim of the study was to investigate the long-term test performance of SARS-CoV-2 RDT in large-scale, clinical screening use during and its influencing factors, above all SARS-CoV-2 VOC and COVID-19 vaccination.Methods In a prospective performance assessment conducted at a single centre tertiary care hospital, RDTs from three manufacturers (NADAL®, Panbio™, MEDsan®) were compared to RT-qPCR among individuals aged ≥ 6 month. The evaluation involved the determination of standardised viral load from oropharyngeal swabs as well as the evaluation of their influencing factors, especially the COVID-19 vaccination, for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in a clinical point-of-care environment spanning from 12 November 2020 to 30 June 2023 among patients, staff, and visitors of the hospital.Results Among the 78,798 RDT/RT-qPCR tandems analysed, 2,016 (2.6%) tandems tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with an overall sensitivity of 34.5% (95% CI 32.4-36.6%). A logistic regression revealed that typical COVID-19 symptoms significantly declined over the course of the study and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and that among the vaccinated, significantly fewer presented with an infection exhibiting typical symptoms. The employed lasso regression model indicated that only higher viral load and typical COVID-19 symptoms significantly increase the likelihood of a positive RDT result in the case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection directly.Conclusion Our findings indicate that only viral load and COVID-19 symptoms directly influence RDT performance while the obtained effects of COVID-19 vaccination and Omicron VOC both reducing RDT performance were mediated by these two factors. RDTs remain an adequate diagnostic tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in individuals showing respiratory symptoms. RDTs show promise beyond SARS-CoV-2, proving adaptable for detecting other pathogens like Influenza and RSV, highlighting their ongoing importance in infection control and prevention efforts."

Respiratory tract infections, particularly influenza, may trigger an increase in the short-term risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Recent studies have also linked this risk to other respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the pathogen-specific relative contributions, the strength of their associations, and overall public health significance are poorly understood. Assuming causal links, understanding, quantifying, and comparing the effects of different pathogens as triggering factors for acute cardiovascular events is critical to guide future research and prevention. Our aim is to conduct a systematic review to examine the relative effects of laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infections as triggers for acute myocardial infarction and stroke.Methods We will conduct a comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science, from inception to the end of March 2024. We will include the following analytical epidemiological study types: randomised controlled trials, cohort and case-control studies, self-controlled case series, and case-crossover designs. We will not impose restrictions on the date, language, geographical region, or sample size, to minimise the risk of introducing biases. Search results will be screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers, and discrepancies resolved by consensus and/or arbitration by a third reviewer. We will assess the risk of bias among the included studies by adopting the Cochrane Collaboration tools for randomised and non-randomised studies. The overall quality of studies will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. We will examine sources of heterogeneity, and if studies are sufficiently homogeneous, a meta-analysis will be conducted to calculate the pooled effect sizes.

Although the performances of in silico tools in predicting variant pathogenicity have been analyzed in previous studies, they have not been analyzed for actionable targets of FDA-approved therapies for NSCLC. The aim of this study is to compare the performance of commonly used in silico tools in classifying the pathogenicity of actionable variants in NSCLC.Materials and Methods We evaluated the performance of the following in silico tools: Polyphen-2 (HumDiv, HumVar), Align-GVGD, MutationTaster2021, CADD, CONDEL, and REVEL. A curated set of targetable NSCLC missense variants (n=236) was used. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of each in silico tool was determined.Results The most recently released MutationTaster2021 demonstrated the highest performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, PPV, and MCC, but was outperformed by CADD for both sensitivity and NPV. Although some tools demonstrated high sensitivities, all tools except MutationTaster2021 displayed markedly low overall specificities, as low as 23%.Conclusion The collective results indicate that the evaluated in silico tools can provide guidance in predicting the pathogenicity of NSCLC missense variants, but are not fully reliable. The tools analyzed in this study could be acceptable to rule out pathogenicity in variants given their higher sensitivities, but are limited when it comes to identifying pathogenicity in variants due to low specificities.HighlightsMutationTaster2021 demonstrated the highest overall performanceCADD demonstrated the highest sensitivity (99.19%) and NPV (96.55%).All tools but MutationTaster2021 demonstrated low specificities, as low as 23%An individual predictor outperformed 3 meta predictorsPerformance variability suggests caution when using in silico tools in the clinic"

Despite parallel research indicating disruption of multiple neurotransmitter systems in AD, it has been unclear whether these two phenomena are related to the neurochemical organization of the cortex. We leveraged task-free magnetoencephalography and positron emission tomography, with a cortical atlas of 19 neurotransmitters to study the alignment and interactions between alterations of neurophysiological signaling, Aβ deposition, and the neurochemical gradients of the human cortex. In patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (N = 18) and probable AD (N = 20), we found that changes in rhythmic, but not arrhythmic, cortical neurophysiological signaling relative to healthy controls (N = 20) are topographically aligned with cholinergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurochemical systems. These neuro-physio-chemical alignments are related to the severity of cognitive and behavioral impairments. We also found that cortical Aβ plaques are preferentially deposited along neurochemical boundaries, and mediate how beta-band rhythmic cortical activity maps align with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Finally, we show in an independent dataset that many of these alignments manifest in the asymptomatic stages of cortical Aβ accumulation (N = 33; N = 71 healthy controls), particularly the Aβ-neurochemical alignments (57.1%) and neuro-physio-chemical alignments in the alpha frequency band (62.5%). Overall, the present study demonstrates that the expression of pathology in pre-clinical and clinical AD aligns topographically with the cortical distribution of chemical neuromodulator systems, scaling with clinical severity and with implications for potential pharmacotherapeutic pathways."

There are two known structural isomers of β2GPI, a J shape and a circular shaped one. The transition between these structures is incompletely understood, with the functional implications unknown. β2GPI is a substrate of the protease plasmin, which cleaves within the fifth domain of β2GPI leading to altered cellular binding. Very little is currently known regarding the structure and function of this protein variant. We present the first comprehensive structural characterisation plasmin-clipped β2GPI and the associated implications for pathogenic antibody binding to this protein.Methods β2GPI was purified using a novel acid-free process from healthy control plasma and cleaved with plasmin. Cleavage was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Structural characterisation was undertaken using dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), ion mobility mass spectrometry (IMMS) and molecular dynamics simulation (MD). Activity was tested using inhibition of β2GPI ELISAs with patient samples and cleaved β2GPI in the fluid phase and cellular binding by flow cytometry using HUVEC cells.Results DLS revealed a significantly smaller hydrodynamic radius for plasmin-clipped β2GPI (p=0.0043). SAXS and MD analysis indicated a novel S-like structure of β2GPI only present in the plasmin-clipped sample whilst IMMS showed a different structure distributions in plasmin clipped compared to non-clipped B2GPI. The increased binding of autoantibodies was shown for plasmin-clipped β2GPI (p=0.056), implying a greater exposure of pathogenic epitopes following cleavage.Conclusions Cleavage of β2GPI by plasmin results in the production of a unique S-shaped structural conformation and higher patient antibody binding. This novel structure may explain the loss of binding to phospholipids and increase in anti-angiogenic potential described previously for plasmin-clipped β2GPI."

Burnout is usually conceptualised as resulting from external pressures rather than internal resilience and although is not a diagnosable condition, it is related to help seeking for its psychological sequelae.Objective To understand how staff support services can intervene with staff heading for burnout, it is important to understand what other intrapsychic factors that are related to it.Methods A diary tool was used by staff in a region of England to self monitor their wellbeing over time. The tool explores many areas of mental health and wellbeing and enabled regression analysis to predict which of the various factors predicted scores on the burnout item.Findings Burnout can be best explained with independent variables including depression, receptiveness, mental wellbeing, and connectedness (p<0.05) using a multiple linear regression model. It was also shown that 71% of the variance present in the response variable, i.e. burnout, explained by independent variables. There is no evidence found for multicollinearity in our regression models confirmed by both the Spearman Rank Correlation and the Variance Inflation Factor methods.Conclusion We showed how burnout can be explained using a handful number of factors including emotional and mental health indicators.Clinical implications The findings suggest a simple set of items can predict burnout and could be used for screening. The data suggests attention to four factors around social safeness, grounding and care in the self, hope and meaning and having sufficient energy could form the basis of attention in weelbeing programs."

Despite decades of research, sepsis remains a major challenge faced by patients, clinicians, and medical systems worldwide. Early identification and prediction of patients at risk of sepsis and adverse outcomes associated with sepsis are critical. In this work, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm that can predict sepsis early.Materials and Methods We developed a predictive model for sepsis using data from the Physionet Cardiology Challenge 2019 ICU database. Our cohort consisted of adult patients who were admitted to the ICU. Sepsis diagnoses were determined using the Sepsis-3 criteria. The model, built with the XGBoost algorithm, was designed to anticipate sepsis prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms. An internal validation was conducted using a hold-off test dataset to evaluate the AI model’s predictive performance.Results We have developed the VIOSync Sepsis Prediction Index (SPI), an AI-based predictive model designed to forecast sepsis up to six hours before its clinical onset, as defined by Sepsis-3 criteria. The AI model, trained on a dataset comprising approximately 40,000 adult patients, integrates variables such as vital signs, laboratory data, and demographic information. The model demonstrated a high prediction accuracy rate of 97%, with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 98% in predicting sepsis up to 6 hours before the onset. When compared to the established qSOFA score, which has a specificity of 89% for sepsis prediction, our VIOSync SPI algorithm significantly enhances predictive reliability, potentially reducing false positive rates by a factor of 5.5.Conclusions The VIOSync SPI demonstrated superior prediction performance over current sepsis early warning scores and predictive algorithms for sepsis onset. To validate the generalizability of our method across populations and treatment protocols, external validation studies are essential."

Furthermore, sleep disturbance, an emerging factor, has not been incorporated into the life-course model of dementia prevention.Objective To estimate the population impact of 12 modifiable risk factors in Canadian adults including sleep disturbance, by sex and age groups, and to compare with other countries.Design Cross-sectional analysis of Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging Baseline dataSetting CommunityParticipants 30,097 adults aged 45 years and older.Measurements Prevalence and Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) of less education, hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, hypertension, excessive alcohol, obesity, smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, diabetes, and sleep disturbance.Results The risk factors with the largest PAF were later life physical inactivity (10.2%; 95% CI, 6.8% to 13%), midlife hearing loss (6.5%; 3.7% to 9.3%), midlife obesity (6.4; 4.1% to 7.7%), and midlife hypertension (6.2%; 2.7% to 9.3%). The PAF of later life sleep disturbance was 3.0% (95% CI, 1.8% to 3.8%). The 12 risk factors accounted for 51.9% (32.2% to 68.0%) of dementia among men and 52.4% (32.5% to 68.7%) among women. Overall, the combined PAF of all risk factors was 49.2% (31.1% to 64.9%), and it increased with age.Conclusion Nearly up to 50% of dementia cases in Canada could be prevented by modifying the 12 risk factors across the lifespan. Canadian risk reduction strategies should prioritize targeting physical inactivity, hearing loss, obesity, and hypertension."

We undertook the current study to collect information about workforce costs related to clinical genomic testing in Australia, identifying key components of pay scales and contracts, and incorporating these into a matrix to enable modelling of disaggregated costs.Methods We undertook a microcosting study of health workforce labour costs in Australia, from a health services perspective. We mapped the genomic testing processes, identifying the relevant workforce. Data was collected on the identified workforce from publicly available pay scales. Estimates were used to model the total cost from a public health services employer perspective, undertaking deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Results We identified significant variability in the way in which pay scales and related conditions are both structured and the levels between jurisdictions. The total costs (2023-24 AUD $) ranged from 160,794 (113,848 - 233,350) for administrative staff to 703,206 (548,011 - 923,661) for pathology staff (full-time equivalent). Deterministic sensitivity analysis identified that the base salary accounts for the greatest source of uncertainty, from 24.8% (20.0% - 32.9%) for laboratory technicians to 53.6% (52.8% - 54.4%) for medical scientists.Conclusion Variations in remuneration levels and conditions between Australian jurisdictions account for considerable variation in the estimated cost of labour and may contribute significantly to the uncertainty of economic assessments of genomic testing and other labour-intensive health technologies. We outline an approach to standardise the collection and estimation of uncertainty for Australian health workforce costs and provide current estimates for labour costs."

However, in 2019, LE0 had gained in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania to 62.94, 62.99, and 66.99 years, respectively. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the progression of LE0 in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania over 61 years (1960-2021).Methods Life tables from World Population Prospects (WPPs) were used to calculate LE0 for Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania by sex from 1960 to 2021. LE0 was contextualized alongside trends in 1960 and 2019. Using decomposition techniques, we examined how each sex contributed to losses or gains in LE0 between 1960 and 2021 and the likely contributory factors to LE0 losses. RStudio software was used to calculate differences in LE0 from one year to another. Linear regression analyses were used to trace the progression of LE0 in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania in six decades.Results LE0 improved from 1960 to 2021 in males and females in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. The most substantial improvement occurred between 1960-1980 in Kenya and Tanzania while in Uganda between 1960-1970. LE0 losses were observed between 1980-2000, and 2020-2021 in Kenya and Tanzania while Uganda experienced losses between 1970-1981; 1989-1993, and 2020-2021. LE0 losses in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania were likely a result of deaths related to high infant, maternal, and child mortality rates due to infectious and non-communicable diseases (1990-2021). In Uganda, the political and economic turmoil during Amin’s regime (1971-1979) registered the most substantial LE0 losses over the period. In addition, LE0 gaps between males and females fluctuated over the years with the highest at 9.5 years in Uganda in 1982 and the lowest at 2.25 years in Kenya in 2001. The fluctuating LE0 gaps between males and females has been observed in the three East African countries.Conclusion LE0 in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania progressively increased from 1960-2021. Males and females showed fluctuating LE0 gaps in the last 61 years but females lived longer than males. There were LE0 losses between 1970-2000 and between 2020-2021. High infant, maternal, and child mortality rates, and later, the high prevalence of HIV and AIDS, immunizable diseases, and the COVID-19 pandemic were the likely reasons for LE0 losses. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to LE0 losses more in Kenya than Tanzania and Uganda likely due to deaths related to the virus itself or the control measures.LE0 losses in Uganda in the 70s were likely due to political and economic turmoil during the brutal Amin’s regime. Even though many studies show LE0 gains in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania over the 61 years, political and economic stability, economic growth, health systems strengthening, control of infectious diseases, and epidemics were critical in the LE0 gains. Thus, a more comprehensive study is warranted to assess the actual impact of public health interventions in LE0 gains in the three East African countries."

Although a substantial body of literature has identified structural brain differences in autism, it is unknown whether autism-associated common genetic variants are linked to changes in cortical macro- and micro-structure. We investigated this using neuroimaging and genetic data from adults (UK Biobank, N = 31,748) and children (ABCD, N = 4,928). Using polygenic scores and genetic correlations we observe a robust negative association between common variants for autism and a magnetic resonance imaging derived phenotype for neurite density (intracellular volume fraction) in the general population. This result is consistent across both children and adults, in both the cortex and in white matter tracts, and confirmed using polygenic scores and genetic correlations. There were no sex differences in this association. Mendelian randomisation analyses provide no evidence for a causal relationship between autism and intracellular volume fraction, although this should be revisited using better powered instruments. Overall, this study provides evidence for shared common variant genetics between autism and cortical neurite density."

Evidence points to these not being configured sufficiently around carers of people with dementia, with potentially their breadth of needs not being recognised. We evaluated the extent of agreement, between carers of people with dementia, primary care, and social care professionals, on their recommendations from assessing carers’ needs in a range of circumstances. It is intended for findings to be taken forward as recommendations for policy and practice.Methods Comparison of judgements, between carers, primary and social care professionals, on whether real-life circumstances in 9 anonymised case vignettes necessitated a range of 14 services to support carers appropriately. Participants were 6 carers of people with dementia, 7 primary care staff, and 2 social care staff. We presented participants with each vignette and asked them to make binary judgements of whether they would recommend a range of services in each case. Percentage agreement and Fleiss’ kappa coefficients measured the level of agreement amongst multiple carers, primary and social care staff and overall. These agreements were then compared.Results Carers agreed in their judgements more than primary or social care professionals. The overall level of agreement from judgements made by all participants, however, was ‘slight’ with variability between participant groups and overall. The need for First Language Support in some cases was recognised, an improvement from previous evidence.Conclusions Case vignettes are useful for investigating judgements concerning these carers’ needs, so raising issues for policy and practice. It is essential for carer assessments to be more reliable in recommending services based on need to ensure less variability, depending on assessor and carers circumstances."

While the association between homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and platinum sensitivity and PARP inhibitors is well established in HGSC, the molecular characteristics of HGEC remain unclear.Methods Fresh-frozen tissue samples from 15 ovarian HGECs and 274 ovarian HGSCs morphologically diagnosed by central pathology review in the Japanese Gynecological Oncology Group (JGOG) were subjected to targeted DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, DNA methylation array, and SNP array analysis. Tumors were classified by unsupervised clustering based on copy number variation signatures. External datasets including 555 ovarian HGSCs and 287 endometrial high-grade carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA-OV and TCGA-UCEC) were also analyzed.Results Four distinct groups were identified in the JGOG cohort. C1 (n=41) showed CCNE1 amplification and poor survival. C2 (n=160) and C3 (n=59) showed a high frequency of BRCA alterations with moderate and low aneuploidy, respectively. C4 (n=22) was characterized by favorable survival, higher frequency of HGEC, absence of both BRCA alteration and CCNE1 amplification, and low levels of HRD score, ploidy, intra-tumoral heterogeneity, cell proliferation rate, and WT1 gene expression. Additionally, C4 exhibited a normal endometrium-like DNA methylation profile and was defined as an “HGEC-type” tumor. The HGEC-type tumors were also identified in TCGA-OV and TCGA-UCEC.Conclusions Ovarian HGEC-type tumors exhibit non-HRD status, a favorable prognosis, and endometrial differentiation, and may comprise a subset of tumors diagnosed as HGSC."

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) poses a significant risk during the acute phase post-stroke, and early recognition is critical for preventive intervention of VTE.Methods Utilizing data from the Shenzhen Neurological Disease System Platform to develop multiple machine learning models that included variables such as demographics, clinical data, and laboratory results. Advanced technologies such as K nearest neighbor and synthetic minority oversampling technique are used for data preprocessing, and algorithms such as gradient boosting machine and support vector machine are used for model development.Feature analysis of optimal models using SHapley Additive exPlanations interpretable algorithm.Results In our study of 1,632 participants, in which women were more prevalent, the median age of patients with VTE was significantly older than that of non-VTE individuals. Data analysis showed that key predictors such as age, alcohol consumption, and specific medical conditions were significantly associated with VTE outcomes. The AUC of all prediction models is above 0.7, and the GBM model shows the highest prediction accuracy with an AUC of 0.923. These results validate the effectiveness of this model in identifying high-risk patients and demonstrate its potential for clinical application in post-stroke VTE risk management.Conclusion This study presents an innovative, machine learning-based approach to predict VTE risk in acute ischemic stroke patients, offering a tool for personalized patient care. Future research could explore integration into clinical decision systems for broader application."

However, the conventional classification process often leaves room for uncertainty and operational challenges.Objective This study aimed to develop and test a replicable method to identify UPF based on discriminative food composition ingredients using the 2017 Brazilian Food Labels Database and evaluate the sensitivity of this method in comparison with the identification of UPF by food name and food category.Methods We created six scenarios to identify UPF using food additives and food substances used in the definition of UPF and compare them with the classic methodology of Nova classification based on product name and food categories. We estimated the proportion of foods and beverages identified as UPF according to the different scenarios based on the presence of these discriminative ingredients, total and per food category. Using a diagnostic test and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, we compared the UPF identified through each of the six scenarios with the ones identified through the classic method.Results We found variations in UPF prevalence from 55% to 72% across scenarios, compared to 70% using the classic method in Brazilian packaged foods. Despite its cautious approach, the scenario using food additives with exclusively cosmetic functions and food substances effectively identified a significant portion of UPF, while maintaining satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, and a better performance on the ROC curve.Conclusion This methodological study emphasizes the importance of detailed criteria to identify UPF, offering researchers alternative and standardized methods for safe decision-making."

The lack of high-quality evidence on optimal management strategies necessitated a national consensus to address this clinical problem.Methods A clinical management pathway was designed through a Delphi consensus process with national experts in peritoneal disease. Two rounds of voting were conducted to assess agreement levels with pathway blocks. Supporting evidence regarding procedural interventions for MGIO underwent evaluation via a rapid literature review.Results Of 111 participants responding in the first round, 90 (81%) responded in the second round. Over 90% consensus was achieved in 4/6 and 6/6 pathway blocks during rounds I and II, respectively. Encouraging a multidisciplinary approach, the pathway emphasized early palliative care assessments and iterative goals of care evaluation throughout treatment. Management was delineated based on obstruction acuity, and selection criteria for palliative-intent surgical interventions and stenting were elucidated. Studies demonstrated limited benefits for such interventions in patients with multifocal obstructions, poor performance status, and high-grade and/or high-burden PSMs. In these cases, a recommendation for supportive care or upper GI decompression tube placement was favored. The overall level of evidence was generally low-moderate in existing literature.Conclusion Given limited evidence, the consensus-driven pathway provides crucial clinical guidance for practitioners dealing with MGIO in PSM patients. There is a need for high-quality prospective evidence in this domain."

CT scans of these subjects at residual volume, functional residual capacity, and total lung capacity were taken for all visits. The functional and structural qCT-based variables were derived, and the subjects were classified into the qCT-based clusters. In addition, the SPECT variables were derived to quantify the heterogeneity of lung ventilation. The correlations between the key qCT-based variables and SPECT-based variables were examined.Results The SPECT-based coefficient of variation (CVTotal), a measure of ventilation heterogeneity, showed strong correlations (|r| ≥ 0.7) with the qCT-based functional small airway disease percentage (fSAD%Total) and emphysematous tissue percentage (Emph%Total) in the total lung on cross-sectional data. As for the two-year changes, the SPECT-based maximum tracer concentration (TCmax), a measure of hot spots, exhibited strong negative correlations with fSAD%Total, Emph%Total, average airway diameter in the left upper lobe, and airflow distribution in the middle and lower lobes.Conclusion Small airway disease is highly associated with the heterogeneity of ventilation in COPD lungs. TCmax is a more sensitive functional biomarker for COPD progression than CVTotal. Besides fSAD%Total and Emph%Total, segmental airways narrowing and imbalanced ventilation between upper and lower lobes may contribute to the development of hot spots over time."

We utilized a Multiplex method to measure 48 cytokines, and developed INT and METAMMUNE composite scores. The measurements included triglycerides, free cholesterol, LDL and HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein (Apo)A1 and ApoB.Results A ROI index was successfully created by extracting a validated principal component, from the number of physician-rated depressive episodes, the frequency of lifetime suicidal ideation and attempts. Adverse childhood experiences accounted for 20-22% of the variance in ROI. The latter was significantly associated with INT and METAMMUNE indices, neuroticism, lifetime and current suicidal behaviors, and the phenome (p<0.001). Our analysis revealed that a significant portion (55.1%) of the variance in the OMDD phenome, which includes current suicidal behaviors, anxiety, and depression, can be accounted for by the regression on INT, ROI, and emotional neglect and abuse. A validated latent construct was successfully extracted from the three ROI components, INT and METAMMUNE indices.Conclusions ROI and associated immune-metabolic biomarkers are indicators of a shared underlying concept, specifically a ROI-neuroimmune-metabolic pathway phenotype. ROI is a crucial indicator of the rising immune-metabolic abnormalities and heightened susceptibility to suicidal tendencies and recurrence of illness."

This manuscript describes results from a national consensus aimed at addressing management of PeM.Methods An update of the 2018 Chicago Consensus Guidelines was conducted using a Modified Delphi technique, encompassing two rounds of voting. The levels of agreement for various pathway blocks were assessed.Results Of 101 participants responding in the first round of Modified Delphi voting, 95 (94%) responded in the second round. Over 90% consensus was achieved in 5/6 and 6/6 pathway blocks in rounds I and II, respectively. Observation was recommended for benign neoplasms, with guidance for interventions in the presence of symptoms or concerning clinicopathologic features. For malignant pathology, management was outlined based on a multidisciplinary assessment of patient characteristics, disease histology, and predictive success of medical and surgical interventions. Additional emphasis was placed on multimodal therapy for Intermediate-Risk and appropriate High-Risk patients. A rapid review demonstrated limited availability of data and inconclusive findings regarding optimal systemic therapy timing. There was unanimous support for considering clinical trial enrollment.Conclusions Given limited evidence, the consensus-driven pathway provides essential guidance regarding the management of PeM. To further direct clinical care, additional dedicated research to generate higher-quality evidence is needed."

To facilitate vaccine development, we conducted an open label observational study to establish a controlled human infection model of sand fly-transmitted cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. major. Between 24th January and 12th August 2022, we exposed 14 (8F, 6M) participants to infected Phlebotomus duboscqi. The primary objective was to demonstrate effectiveness (take rate) and safety (absence of CL lesion at 12 months), whereas secondary and exploratory objectives included rate of lesion development, parasite load and analysis of local immune responses by immunohistology and spatial transcriptomics. We estimated an overall take rate for CL development of 64% (9/14), or 82% (9/11) if calculated using only participants having confirmed bites following exposure. Lesion development was terminated by therapeutic biopsy in 10 participants with confirmed bites. 2/10 had one and 1/10 had two lesion recurrences 4-8 months after biopsy that were treated successfully with cryotherapy. No severe or serious adverse events were recorded, but scarring was evident as expected. All participants were lesion-free at >12 month follow up. We provide the first comprehensive map of immune cell distribution and cytokine/chemokine expression in human CL lesions, revealing discrete immune niches. This controlled human infection model offers opportunities for rapid vaccine candidate selection and a greater understanding of immune-mediated protection and pathology."

However, little is known about its impact in low-resource settings such as sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, to address this, we systematically conducted a scoping review to explore the COVID-19 impact on diabetes outcomes and care in countries of sub-Saharan Africa.Methods We applied our search strategy to PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, African Index Medicus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Science Direct, ERIC and Embase to obtain relevant articles published from January 2020 to March 2023. Two independent reviewers were involved in the screening of retrieved articles. Data from eligible articles were extracted from quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies. Numerical data were summarised using descriptive statistics, while a thematic framework was used to categorise and identify themes for qualitative data.Results We found 42 of the retrieved 360 articles eligible, mainly from South Africa, Ethiopia and Ghana (73.4%). COVID-19 increased the risk of death (OR 1.30 – 9.0, 95% CI), hospitalisation (OR 3.30 – 3.73: 95% CI), and severity (OR: 1.30-4.05, 95% CI) in persons with diabetes mellitus. COVID-19 also increased the risk of developing diabetes mellitus in hospitalised cases. The pandemic, on the other hand, was associated with disruptions in patient self-management routine and diabetes mellitus care service delivery. Three major themes emerged, namely, (i) patient-related health management challenges, (ii) diabetes mellitus care service delivery challenges, and (iii) reorganisation of diabetes mellitus care delivery.Conclusion COVID-19 increased mortality and morbidity among people living with diabetes mellitus. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic worsened diabetes mellitus care management. Sub-Saharan African countries should, therefore, institute appropriate policy considerations for persons with diabetes mellitus during widespread emergencies."

EPs and DTI are both useful methods for studying neural connectivity in the brain but measure different aspects of brain function. EPs provide information on electrical connectivity, while DTI provides information on anatomical pathways connecting regions.Methods This study focused on the pallidum and motor thalamus nuclei, which are common targets for DBS in dystonia. Prior to DBS implantation, DTI images were acquired for each patient, and were processed to obtain DTI coefficients such as length (L), volume (V), and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the fiber tracts. The relationship between the fiber tracts and electrophysiology was examined using a generalized linear model (GLM).Results We showed that the amplitude of EPs correlated with FA and tract volume, while delay correlated with tract length. These findings suggest that DBS signals travel across tracts to affect both local and distant brain regions, and the magnitude of the effect of DBS is determined by the integrity of the white matter tract, while DBS signal delay is affected by the tract length. Our results further suggest that the magnitude and delay of the spread of the DBS signal may be predicted by the DTI connectivity. This provides strong supporting evidence for other studies that have assumed, but have been unable to test, such a relationship.Conclusion Overall, this study suggests that the electrical effects of DBS can be at least partially predicted by noninvasive DTI imaging in patients with dystonia. By combining EPs with DTI, we could investigate the propagation of stimulation pulses through brain regions. While this relationship has been previously hypothesized by the neuroscience community, this is the first study in humans to demonstrate this relationship between DBS EPs and DTI, thereby advancing the field of human brain mapping and enhancing the precision of neurosurgical targeting."

This manuscript describes the results of a national consensus aimed at addressing clinical management of patients with NEN-PMs.Methods An update of the 2018 Chicago consensus guidelines was conducted using a modified Delphi technique, encompassing two rounds of voting. The levels of agreement for various pathway blocks were rigorously assessed. Key systemic therapy concepts were summarized by content experts. Supporting evidence was evaluated via a rapid literature review.Results Overall, the level of evidence for the management of PM in this disease was universally low. In total, 107 participants responded in the first round, with 88/107 (82%) participating in the second round. Strong consensus (> 90%) was achieved in 5/7 (71%) and 7/7 (100%) blocks in rounds I and II respectively. A multidisciplinary approach including psychosocial and wellness assessments received a strong positive recommendation. Management of NENs with PMs was organized according to disease grade and symptom profiles. In grade 1 and 2 well-differentiated NENs, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) received strong support (>95%) following the management of functional syndromes (if present). For grade 3 well-differentiated NENs, systemic therapy is the primary recommendation, with surgical resection considered in select cases. Poorly differentiated NENs (i.e. neuroendocrine carcinomas) are predominantly treated with chemotherapy.Conclusion Given limited evidence, the consensus-driven clinical pathway offers vital clinical guidance for the management on NENs with PM. The need for high-quality evidence remains critical to the field."

However, there is still much to learn regarding using digitally delivered psychotherapies in trauma-affected populations, including military members, Veterans, and public safety personnel. This study examined perceptions of psychotherapies utilized for trauma-maffected populations, as reported by Canadian military members, Veterans, and public safety personnel who completed such interventions and mental health clinicians who provided them. Specifically, we explored the imposed shift to digital health use, what changed with this rapid shift, what needs, problems, and solutions arose, and important future considerations associated with delivering trauma-focused and adjunct treatments digitally.Quantitative survey data were collected from 11 Canadian patients (military members, Veterans, and public safety personnel with post-traumatic stress injury) and 12 Canadian mental health clinicians. Survey questions were adapted from the Alberta Quality Matrix for Health (AQMH) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. As a follow-up, participants were invited to participate in either a semi-structured qualitative interview or focus group to further explore their perspectives on digitally delivered trauma-focused and adjunct therapies. Four clients and 19 clinician participants participated in an interview or focus group.In survey and interview/focus group results, patient and clinician participants reported that digitally delivered trauma and adjunct therapies offered similar treatment effectiveness as in-person delivery while also improving treatment access. Participants indicated unique advantages of digital delivery, including the increased accessibility of treatment, cost effectiveness, and more efficient use of resources. However, some participants struggled with using digital platforms and felt less comfortable working in a digital environment. Further research with a larger, more diverse population is required to corroborate our results and identify other avenues in which psychotherapies utilized for trauma-affected populations can be engaged with and improved upon.Author Summary Many mental health service sites were faced with rapid and unexpected shifts towards digital delivery of mental health services to comply with mandated physical distancing restrictions put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is limited literature exploring the accessibility of CAMHS for autistic young people, particularly from parents’ perspectives. The present study aimed to 1) explore the experiences of parents/carers seeking help from CAMHS for their autistic child’s mental health difficulties, and 2) gain parents’ perceptions of the accessibility of CAMHS support for their child and understand what could be improved.Methods A mixed-methods survey design was used to learn from parents/carers. 300 parents/carers took part from across the UK between June and October 2023. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data using qualitative content analysis.Results Findings demonstrated the ongoing struggles that parents/carers faced when seeking professional help from CAMHS for their child. Many were not referred to CAMHS or were rejected without an assessment, often due to issues relating to diagnostic overshadowing, a high threshold for assessment, or a lack of professional knowledge about autism and care pathways. Those who were referred reported a lack of reasonable adjustments and offers of ineffective or inappropriate therapies, leaving young people unable to engage, and thus not benefiting. Ultimately, parents felt their child’s mental health difficulties either did not improve or declined to the point of crisis. However, there was a recognition that some professionals were kind and compassionate, and provided the validation that parents needed.Conclusions There is a need for a more neuro-inclusive and personalised approach in CAMHS, from the professionals themselves, in the adjustments that are offered, and in the therapies that are provided. Further research, funding, and training are urgently needed to ensure mental health support is accessible, timely, and effective for autistic CYP."

Faced with the possible presence of other respiratory pathogens that could co-infect and modify the clinical response of patients detected for SARS-CoV-2, some researchers have explored this line of investigation. The relationship between these co-infections remains unclear, leading to a need to deepen our knowledge about interactions among pathogens, and between pathogens and the host. Thus, the present study employed RT-qPCR to assess the presence of Human Adenovirus (HAdV), Influenza A (Flu A), Influenza B (Flu B), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Human Rhinovirus (HRV), and Parainfluenza Virus (PIV). A total of 187 nasopharyngeal samples from adult patients exhibiting respiratory symptoms were collected between February 2021 and November 2022 at the University Hospital Polydoro Ernani de Sao Thiago in Florianopolis, SC, Brazil. Our findings revealed that 25.16% of samples tested positive for non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses (29.8% - HRV, 5.3% - PIV, 4.3%-RSV, and 1.1% - HMPV). From the 74.84% of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, the presence of co-infection was observed in 9,7% of patients, with 7.5% being HRV, 1.1% HAdV and 1.1% Flu A. Since co-infections can potentially alter patient prognoses and impact local epidemiological dynamics, this study highlights the significance of ongoing monitoring and epidemiological assessment through genomic surveillance of other clinically relevant respiratory pathogens."

Given differences in AD risk across diverse populations, generalizability of existing biomarker data is not assured.Methods In 2,086 individuals of diverse genetic ancestries (African American, Caribbean Hispanic, and Peruvians) we measured plasma pTau-181 and Aβ42/Aβ40. Differences in biomarkers between cohorts and clinical diagnosis groups and the potential discriminative performance of the two biomarkers were assessed.Results pTau-181 and Aβ42/Aβ40 were consistent across cohorts. Higher levels of pTau181 were associated with AD while Aβ42/Aβ40 had minimal differences. Correspondingly, pTau-181 had greater predictive value than Aβ42/Aβ40, however, the area under the curve differed between cohorts.Discussion pTau-181 as a plasma biomarker for clinical AD is generalizable across genetic ancestries, but predictive value may differ. Combining genomic and biomarker data from diverse individuals will increase understanding of genetic risk and refine clinical diagnoses."

This study aimed to develop a robust ML-based predictive model that integrates multimodal echocardiographic data and clinical risk factors to evaluate the risk of thrombosis in patients with NVAF.METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 402 NVAF patients scheduled for AF radiofrequency ablation and/or left atrial appendage closure at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from January 2020 to December 2023 were prospectively collected. Among them, there were 289 males (71.9%) and 113 females (28.1%), with a mean age of 59.7 years. There were 142 patients (35.3%) with left atrial thrombus/spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (LAT/SEC) and 260 patients (64.7%) without LAT/SEC. Clinical data, biochemical markers, and multimodal echocardiographic parameters were collected to construct the model. After screening the influencing factors with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, we explored seven ML models – Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to forecast the risk of thrombosis in NVAF patients. A variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The DeLong test was applied to compare area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves across different ML models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to gauge the clinical utility of each ML model by comparing their clinical net benefit. To gain insight into the risk prediction model, we used Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis and investigated the contributions of the different variables. The incorporation of multimodal echocardiographic parameters and clinical risk factors using advanced ML algorithms markedly enhanced the accuracy of predicting thrombosis risk in individuals with NVAF. Specifically, the XGBoost model (AUC 0.959, 95% CI 0.925–0.993) slightly outperformed the traditional LR model (AUC 0.949, 95% CI: 0.911-0.987) in predicting thrombosis risk in NVAF patients, and showed superior predictive ability compared to other ML algorithms. Additionally, XGBoost offered greater clinical net benefit within a threshold probability range of 0.1 to 1.0. SHAP analysis revealed that left atrial structure (left atrial volume index, three-dimensional sphericity index), hemodynamic parameters (left atrial acceleration factor and S/D ratio), and functional parameters (peak atrial longitudinal strain and left ventricular ejection fraction) were important features in predicting the risk of thrombus formation in NVAF patients, with reduced peak atrial longitudinal strain being the most important risk factor for predicting thrombus.CONCLUSIONS Developing a predictive model utilizing ML techniques that incorporate multimodal echocardiographic parameters in conjunction with clinical risk factors has the potential to enhance the predictive accuracy of the thrombosis risk in individuals with NVAF. The XGBoost model shows that decreased PALS, hemodynamic abnormalities and left atrium spherical remodeling are significant factors correlated with increased risk of thrombus in NVAF."

If patients at elevated risk of involuntary admission could be identified, prevention may be possible.Objectives To develop and validate a prediction model for involuntary admission of patients receiving care within a psychiatric service system using machine learning trained on routine clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs).Methods EHR data from all adult patients who had been in contact with the Psychiatric Services of the Central Denmark Region between 2013 and 2021 were retrieved. We derived 694 patient predictors (covering e.g., diagnoses, medication, and coercive measures) and 1,134 predictors from free text using term frequency - inverse document frequency and sentence transformers. At every voluntary inpatient discharge (prediction time), without an involuntary admission in the two years prior, we predicted involuntary admission 180 days ahead. XGBoost and Elastic Net regularized logistic regression models were trained on 85% of the dataset. The best performing model was tested on the remaining 15% of the data.Results The model was trained on 50,634 voluntary inpatient discharges among 17,968 unique patients. The cohort comprised 1,672 voluntary inpatient discharges followed by an involuntary admission. The XGBoost model performed best in the training phase and obtained an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.84 in the test phase.Conclusion A machine learning model using routine clinical EHR data can accurately predict involuntary admission. If implemented as a clinical decision support tool, this model may guide interventions aimed at reducing the risk of involuntary admission."

Surveillance, a cornerstone of disease control and prevention, can be strengthened to promote more timely, efficient, and equitable practices by incorporating health information exchange (HIE) and other large-scale health data sources into reporting. New York City patient-level electronic health record data between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2023 were obtained from Healthix, the largest US public HIE. Healthix data were linked to neighborhood-level information from the American Community Survey. In this case-control study, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV-positive cases were compared to controls to estimate the odds of receiving a specific laboratory test or positive result using generalized estimating equations with logit function and robust standard errors. Among 1,519,121 tests performed for chlamydia, 1,574,772 for gonorrhea, and 1,200,560 for HIV, 2%, 0.6% and 0.3% were positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV, respectively. Chlamydia and gonorrhea co-occurred in 1,854 cases (7% of chlamydia and 21% of gonorrhea total cases). Testing behavior was often incongruent with geographic and sociodemographic patterns of positive cases. For example, people living in areas with the highest levels of poverty were less likely to test for gonorrhea but almost twice as likely to test positive compared to those in low poverty areas. Regional HIE enabled review of testing and cases using granular and complementary data not typically available given existing reporting practices. Enhanced surveillance spotlights potential incongruencies between testing patterns and STI risk in certain populations, signaling potential under- and over-testing. These and future insights derived from HIE data may be used to continuously inform public health practice and drive further improvements in provision and evaluation of services and programs."

Despite the absence of established non-targeted non-challenge-based diagnostic procedures, recent studies have identified discriminatory VOCs associated with PATM using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Breath VOCs, originating from the bloodstream, hold promise for non-invasive diagnosis.We conducted breath analysis on 23 individuals exhibiting TMAU-like symptoms and identified a diverse array of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that discriminate between different subgroups. Using logistic regression, we achieved an accuracy of 88%, with both precision and recall at 88-89%, in distinguishing TMAU-negative individuals from those who tested positive at some point in their lives, solely based on the presence of Propylene Oxide ((2R)-2-Methyloxirane and (2S)-2-Methyloxirane). However, due to the limited subset and missing data, it cannot serve as the sole discriminating biomarker. Inclusion of additional VOCs in the analysis increased accuracy of the model to 85-95%, with precision and recall ranging from 85% to 100%, depending on the combinations of VOCs used.Unsupervised learning algorithms generally grouped positively tested individuals together based on endogenous VOCs, while negatively tested individuals were clustered into two distinct groups. Toluene, previously found to be elevated in PATM individuals, was identified as a discriminatory marker for those previously diagnosed with TMAU, but had since tested negative while still experiencing symptoms. Other PATM biomarkers, such as p-Xylene and Hexanal, were generally higher in TMAU positive individuals and were good predictors of TMAU history when combined with other VOCs.Our analysis revealed that the TMAU-positive group exhibited a greater abundance of biomarkers indicative of advanced oxidative stress in their breath samples and primary oxidative stress in their air samples, likely originating from their skin. Conversely, the TMAU-negative group demonstrated a higher likelihood of biomarkers associated with secondary oxidative stress in their air samples.Our findings highlight the potential of breath analysis as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for idiopathic malodor conditions. They underscore the importance of analyzing exogenous chemicals for insights into metabolism, detoxification, and elimination of toxins. This approach could help eliminate unnecessary challenge tests and emphasize the role of metabolomics in understanding the mechanisms underlying these conditions.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03451994;https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03451994Data available at https://osf.io/w7682 via the Open Science Framework"

Failure to do so can perpetuate a self-reinforcing cycle of misaligned and ineffective support, further exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. This study directly addresses this gap by using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to empower Youth Living with HIV (YLHIV) in India to address their mental health challenges. YLHIV actively participated in adapting and implementing a culturally responsive mental health screening program. The study, incorporating CBPR principles at every step aimed to identify practical methods for integrating YLHIV voices in research, and showcase the value of YLHIV participation in co-creating and implementing impactful interventions. Six youth investigators aged 18-24, born with HIV and residing in southern Indian states underwent certification in human subjects’ protection and training in mental health screening and survey administration techniques. They actively shaped the research process by culturally adapting standardized mental health screening tools (PHQ-9, GAD-7) through iterative discussions with experts, drawing on their own perspectives. Following field assessments of the mental health screening tools among their peers, they documented their reflections in surveys and written essays. Youth investigators’ involvement improved the research process by optimizing tools, combating stigma, and facilitating reliable data collection. Beyond data collection, the youth investigators’ participation significantly boosted their own knowledge, self-confidence, and research skills. This study serves as an illustrative model of CBPR in mental health research among YLHIV, highlighting the importance of interactive training, continuous feedback mechanisms, and respectful youth engagement in fostering impactful research that can inform tailored sustainable interventions."

Currently, a new sedative drug, remimazolam tosilate, can be used in digestive endoscopy and bronchoscopy. We will study its effect on hysteroscopy and its impact on patient recovery time and hospital discharge time.Methods Ninety-five patients undergoing hysteroscopy were randomly divided into two groups and received an initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg remimazolam tosilate (R group) and an initial dose of 2 mg/kg propofol (P group) as anesthetics during the examination. The primary end point was anesthesia recovery time (the time required for the patient’s MOAA/S score to reach 5 from the cessation of drug use) and hospital discharge time (the time required for the patient’s PADS score to reach 9 from the cessation of drug use). Secondary endpoints were first-dose sedation success rate, incidence of hypotension, and injection pain.Results Age(P = 0.825), height(P = 0.174), weight(P = 0.667) and ASA grade (P = 0.972) were not significantly different between the two groups. The recovery time in the R group was significantly shorter than that in the P group (P = 0.019), and the data kurtosis in the R group was higher than that in the P group (1.19 vs −0.56), but there was no significant difference in the time to hospital discharge (P = 0.696). There was no significant difference in the success rate of the first dose of sedation between the two groups (P = 0.362), but the incidence of hypotension during anesthesia (P = 0.001) and the incidence of injection pain (P = 0.001) in the R group was significantly lower than those in P group.Conclusions Remimazolam tosilate is suitable for hysteroscopy anesthesia and can reduce intraoperative hypotension and injection pain during the examination, a more optimal dosage or target-controlled infusion model still needs to be further explored."

The COM-B model was used to guide data collection and analysis.Setting The study was carried out in outpatient department of ophthalmology in China.Participants 24 patients with DME who experienced anti-VEGF treatment at least one injection within one year were recruited using convenience and purposed sampling.Results The themes and subthemes were identified. Physical capability included (1) lack of knowledge, (2) high treatment expenditure, and psychological capability included prioritized glycemic control rather than anti-VEGF. Social opportunity included (1) no anti-VEGF available, (2) Recommended eyedrops, laser and oral drug but not mentioned intravitreal anti-VEGF injection, (3) As an optional therapy, selected more convenient treatment rather than anti-VEGF agents, and physical opportunity included (1) no confidence in treatment from doctor, (2) communication between doctors and patients. Reflective motivation included (1) outcome expectancies, and automatic motivation included (1) fear of injection, (2) fear of blindness.Conclusion We should attach importance to these eleven factors, especially to effective interaction between doctors and patients, and doctor’s authoritative treatment advice, which interventions were based on in the future.Strengths and limitations of this study⇒ The qualitative design was used to understand factors affecting timely intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in patients with DME and to explore the potential measures to change them.⇒The study highlighted the importance of efficient communication between clinicians and patients.⇒The study didn’t consider other clinical variables, such as the severity and duration of diabetes, which should be included in the future studies."

This study aims to assess the impact of increased diagnosis for early HIV infection combined with immediate antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation on reducing HIV transmission among MSM. We developed an agent-based model calibrated to HIV surveillance and sexual behavior data for MSM in the Netherlands. We simulated a 10-year intervention that accelerates HIV diagnosis during the first 3 or 6 months after HIV acquisition across five levels of increased diagnosis rates (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32-fold), followed by immediate ART initiation. The upper limit of the intervention’s impact over 10 years is projected to lower median cumulative HIV infections from 469 (interquartile range [IQR]: 300–681), projected without the intervention, to 184 (IQR: 142-–239), denoted as maximum impact. A 16-fold increase in the diagnosis rate within 3 months after HIV acquisition results in 263 (IQR: 182–349) infections. Further increases in the diagnosis rate show diminishing returns, failing to reach the maximum impact. By extending the scope of the intervention to individuals who acquired HIV infection within the previous 6 months, a 16-fold increase in the diagnosis rate approaches closely the maximum impact of the intervention. Accelerating early HIV diagnosis through increased awareness, screening, and testing can further reduce transmission among MSM, provided diagnosis rates rise significantly. Meeting this goal necessitates a stakeholder needs assessment.Author summary In recent years, in the Netherlands, the annual number of new HIV infections in the population of men who have sex with men (MSM) has been declining. Using an agent-based model calibrated to the current state of the HIV epidemic in MSM in the Netherlands, we explored the potential impact of an intervention that accelerates diagnosis in individuals with early HIV infection and facilitates immediate antiretroviral treatment initiation on further reducing the number of new HIV infections. Our projections indicate that such an intervention can noticeably reduce onward HIV transmission in the population of MSM. To achieve this, the diagnosis rate for individuals with early HIV infection would need to increase 16-fold. Increasing the diagnosis rate beyond this level is expected to bring marginal improvements, without approaching the maximum potential of the intervention. Extending the intervention to target individuals who acquired HIV within the previous 6 months could further lower the number of new HIV infections, bringing it closer to the maximum impact. Therefore, the intervention, which achieves an increased diagnosis rate in individuals with early HIV who then immediately initiate ART, can bring forth substantial reductions in new HIV infections, even against a backdrop of an already declining trend of the HIV epidemic."

Studies of the incidence and prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that may contribute to or aggravate its acquisition remain an effective means of prevention. In recent years, terrorist groups have established themselves in the northern regions of Cameroon. This insecurity has led to a large influx of refugees with no information about their HIV and STI status. Given this above mentioned situation, this study aimed to assess the incidence and prevalence of HIV and STI and their associated risk factors in order to adjust strategies to monitor the epidemic. A cohort of 684 consenting participants from the North and Far North were enrolled in the study in 2021 and followed up in 2022 to measure the incidence and prevalence of HIV and to assess some associated risk factors. Each participant was administered a pretested questionnaire to collect sociodemographic variables and risk behaviors. Anti-HIV Ab, HBsAg (Hepatitis B Surface Antigen), TPHA (Treponema Pallidum Hemagglutination Assay) tests were performed. The data were compiled using EPI Info 7.5.2 for epidemiological analyses. The association between co-infections of HIV, Hepatitis, and syphilis and HIV incidence was evaluated using the Chi-2 test. The HIV incidence and overall prevalence were 1.63% (163/10,000 population) and 3.8%, respectively. The HIV incidence increased from 0.27% in 2017 (DHS) to 1.63% in the North and Far North regions as found in our study. The incidences of syphilis and hepatitis B were 1.03% and 4.56%, respectively. Factors associated with HIV acquisition included religion (Muslims being more infected, P<0.03), unprotected sex with a new partner (P<0.007), having a sex worker as a partner (P<0.0001), and co-infection with syphilis and hepatitis B (P<0.05). The findings also link increased HIV incidence to insecurity and population displacement. In HIV prevention strategies, it is important to consider the security and political stability context as well as HIV-associated infections such as hepatitis B and syphilis."

This study focuses on PD non-fine-tuned wav2vec 1.0 architecture. Utilizing features derived from wav2vec embedding, we develop machine learning models tailored for clinically relevant PD speech diagnosis tasks, such as cross-database classification and regression to predict demographic and articulation characteristics, for instance, modeling the subjects’ age and number of characters per second. The primary aim is to conduct feature importance analysis on both classification and regression tasks, investigating whether latent discrete speech representations in PD are shared across models, particularly for related tasks. The proposed wav2vec-based models were evaluated on PD versus healthy controls using three multi-language-task PD datasets. Results indicated that wav2vec accurately detected PD based on speech, outperforming feature extraction using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients in the proposed cross-database scenarios. Furthermore, wav2vec proved effective in regression, modeling various quantitative speech characteristics related to intelligibility and aging. Subsequent analysis of important features, obtained using scikit-learn feature importance built-in tools and the Shapley additive explanations method, examined the presence of significant overlaps between classification and regression models. The feature importance experiments discovered shared features across trained models, with increased sharing for related tasks, further suggesting that wav2vec contributes to improved generalizability. In conclusion, the study proposes wav2vec embedding as a promising step toward a speech-based universal model to assist in the evaluation of PD."

Whether brain waves in patients with diabetes differ from those of healthy subjects is unknown. We examined the hypothesis that patients with diabetes have reduced sleep spindle waves, a form of brain wave implicated in periphery glucose regulation during sleep.Methods From a retrospective analysis of polysomnography (PSG) studies on patients who underwent sleep apnea evaluation, we identified 1,214 studies of patients with diabetes mellitus (>66% type 2) and included a sex- and age-matched control subject for each within the scope of our analysis. We similarly identified 376 patients with prediabetes and their matched controls. We extracted spindle characteristics from artifact-removed PSG electroencephalograms and other patient data from records. We used rank-based statistical methods to test hypotheses. We validated our finding on an external PSG dataset.Results Patients with diabetes mellitus exhibited on average about half the spindle density (median=0.38 spindles/min) during sleep as their matched control subjects (median=0.70 spindles/min) (P<2.2e-16). Compared to controls, spindle loss was more pronounced in female patients than in male patients in the frontal regions of the brain (P=0.04). Patients with prediabetes also exhibited signs of lower spindle density compared to matched controls (P=0.01-0.04).Conclusions Patients with diabetes have fewer spindle waves that are implicated in glucose regulation than matched controls during sleep. Besides offering a possible explanation for neurological complications from diabetes, our findings open the possibility that reversing/reducing spindle loss could improve the overall health of patients with diabetes mellitus.Funding This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (ZIA ES101765)."

In this paper, we study the optimal way to distribute a finite stock of COVID-19 doses between first or second doses for unvaccinated individuals and third doses (booster shots) for fully vaccinated individuals. We introduce a novel compartmental model that accommodates for vaccinated populations. This Booster model is implemented to simulate two prototypes of populations: one with a highly infected and highly vaccinated proportion, and another with a low infected and vaccinated percentage. We namely use sample data from Russia and Djibouti respectively.Our findings show that, to minimize the deaths for the first type of populations, around one quarter of the vaccines should be employed as booster shots and the rest as first and second doses. On the other hand, the second type of populations can minimize their number of deaths by mainly focusing on administering the initial two doses, rather than giving any booster shots. The novel Booster model allows us to study the effect of the third dose on a community and provides a useful tool to draw public policies on the distribution of vaccines during pandemics."

They have a higher occupational risk of contracting the disease than the general population, and a greater chance of them transmitting the disease to vulnerable patients under their care. Given their scarcity and low COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Africa, it is essential that HCWs are seroprotected and their exposure to COVID-19 minimized. This study was therefore designed to determine IgG antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs in North Eastern, Tanzania.Methodology This was a cross-sectional study carried out among 273 HCWs at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), a tertiary, zonal referral hospital in Tanzania’s North Eastern region. Stratified sampling was used to select study participants. Data were obtained from each consenting participant using a validated questionnaire. Blood samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies quantification by using an indirect ELISA test. RedCap software was used to enter and manage data. Statistical analysis was done by using STATA statistical software version 15 and GraphPad Prism v 9.0. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered the cut-off for statistical significance.Results Among 273 HCWS only 37.9 % reported to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Except for one person, all of the participants had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody concentrations that were positive, with 64.5% of them having strong seropositivity. Female gender, allied health professionals, active smoking, COVID-19 patient interactions, COVID-19 vaccination receptivity, and adherence to recommended hand hygiene were found to be significant predictors of variation of median SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentration. The usage of personal protective equipment, history of previously testing PCR positive for COVID-19, the number of COVID-19 patient exposure and age were found to cause no significant variation in median antibody concentration among participants.Conclusions This study reports a high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthcare workers in Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre. This suggests that HCWs have significant exposure to SARS-CoV-2 despite the low rate of vaccination acceptance even among HCWs. We recommend a strengthened Infectious Prevention and Control (IPC) in hospitals through provision of technical leadership and coordination according to WHO guidelines. We also recommend continued conduction of seroprevalence studies to estimate the magnitude and trends of SARS-CoV-2 infections in different populations in Tanzania. A better understanding of the past, current, and future transmission patterns of infectious pathogens is critical for preparedness and response planning, and to inform the optimal implementation of existing and novel interventions under the current and changing climate."

There is a need for personalized treatments based on biomarkers in guiding treatment options. The calcium voltage-gated channel CACNA1C is a promising candidate for developing personalized treatments. CACNA1C is implicated in BD by genome-wide association studies and several lines of evidence suggest that targeting L-type calcium channels could be an effective treatment strategy. However, before such individualized treatments can be pursued, biomarkers predicting treatment response need to be developed.Methods As a first step in testing the hypothesis that CACNA1C genotype is associated with serum levels of CACNA1C, we conducted ELISA measures on serum samples from 100 subjects with BD and 100 control subjects.Results We observed significantly higher CACNA1C (p<0.01) protein levels in subjects with BD. The risk SNP (rs11062170) showed functional significance as subjects homozygous for the risk allele (CC) had significantly greater CACNA1C protein levels compared to subjects with one (p=0.013) or no copies (p=0.009). We observed higher somatostatin (SST) (p<0.003) protein levels and lower levels of the clock protein ARTNL (p<0.03) and stress signaling factor corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) (p<0.001) in BD. SST and PER2 protein levels were associated with both alcohol dependence and lithium response.Conclusions Our findings represent the first evidence for increased serum levels of CACNA1C in BD. Along with altered levels of SST, ARNTL, and CRH our findings suggest CACNA1C is associated with circadian rhythm and stress response disturbances in BD."

This study introduces an innovative Explanable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework, leveraging historical electronic health records (EHRs) to enhance BSI prediction. Unlike traditional models that rely heavily on real-time clinical data, our XAI-based approach utilizes a comprehensive dataset incorporating demographic data, laboratory results, and full medical histories from St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway, covering 35,591 patients between 2015 and 2020. We developed models to differentiate between high-risk and low-risk BSI cases effectively, optimizing healthcare resource allocation and potentially reducing healthcare costs. Our results demonstrate superior predictive accuracy, particularly the tree-based models, which significantly outperformed contemporary models in both specificity and sensitivity metrics.Author Summary In this research, we have developed a new tool that uses artificial intelligence to better predict bloodstream infections, which can lead to serious conditions like sepsis if not quickly identified and treated. It is the first of its kind framework that analyzes past health records and helps identify patients who are at high risk of infection more accurately than existing tools. Unlike existing tools our framework can be implemented at any stage of the patient trajectory and is the only framework to achieve good accuracy without the use of intimate patient features such as vital signs. This ability could enable doctors to prioritize care more pre-emptively, effectively, potentially saving lives and reducing unnecessary medical tests. Our approach is designed to be easily understood and used by both medical professionals and those with little technical expertise, making it a valuable addition to hospital systems."

Unfortunately, current antidepressant and psychotherapeutic treatments exhibit limited efficacy and unsatisfactory response rates in a substantial number of patients. The development of effective therapies for MDD is hindered by the insufficiently understood heterogeneity within the disorder and its elusive underlying mechanisms. To address these challenges, we present a target-oriented multimodal fusion framework that robustly predicts antidepressant response by integrating structural and functional connectivity data (sertraline: R2 = 0.31; placebo: R2 = 0.22). Through the model, we identify multimodal neuroimaging biomarkers of antidepressant response and observe that sertraline and placebo show distinct predictive patterns. We further decompose the overall predictive patterns into constitutive network constellations with generalizable structural-functional co-variation, which exhibit treatment-specific association with personality traits and behavioral/cognitive task performance. Our innovative and interpretable multimodal framework provides novel insights into the intricate neuropsychopharmacology of antidepressant treatment and paves the way for advances in precision medicine and development of more targeted antidepressant therapeutics.Trial Registration Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care for Depression (EMBARC), NCT#01407094"

Using genome-wide genetic data, we studied the SCZ-height relationship on a genetic level. We identified 22 independent lead SNPs (55% sign-concordant) and 142 genes statistically associated with both SCZ and height. Additionally, we found gene enrichment for pituitary cell-types and immune response gene-sets. While the global SCZ-height genetic correlation was nonsignificant, 9 genomic regions showed robust local genetic correlations (7 negative, 6 in the MHC-region). The shared genetic signal for SCZ and height within the 6 MHC-regions was found to be partially explained by mutual genetic overlap with serum white blood cell count, particularly lymphocytes. Fine-mapping prioritized 3 shared effector-genes (GIGYF2, HLA-C, and LIN28B) involved in immune response and developmental timing. Overall, the results illuminate the genetic processes involved in the SCZ-height relationship and illustrates the utility of genetic data in furthering epidemiological insight."

We aimed to estimate the comprehensive health-economic burden associated with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) attributable to PCV24- and PCV31-additional (non-PCV20) serotypes in the United States.Methods We multiplied all-cause incidence rate estimates for acute otitis media (AOM), sinusitis, and non-bacteremic pneumonia by estimates of the proportions of each of these conditions attributable to pneumococci and the proportions of pneumococcal infections involving PCV24- and PCV31-additional serotypes. We obtained serotype-specific IPD incidence rates from US Active Bacterial Core surveillance data. We accounted for direct medical and non-medical costs associated with each condition to estimate resulting health-economic burden. Non-medical costs included missed work and lost quality-adjusted life years due to death and disability.Results The health-economic burden of PCV24-additional serotypes totaled $1.3 billion ($1.1-1.7b) annually in medical and non-medical costs, comprised of $0.9b ($0.7-1.2b) due to ARIs and $0.4b ($0.3-0.5b) due to IPD. For PCV31-additional serotypes, medical and non-medical costs totaled $7.5b ($6.6-8.6b) annually, with $5.5b ($4.7-6.6b) due to ARIs and $1.9b ($1.8-2.1b) due to IPD. The largest single driver of costs was non-bacteremic pneumonia, particularly in adults aged 50-64 and ≥65 years.Conclusions Additional serotypes in PCV24 and PCV31, especially those included in PCV31, account for substantial health-economic burden in the United States.Summary Novel serotypes in 24- and 31-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, currently in clinical trials, account for substantial health-economic burdens in the United States, especially in adults ≥50 years. Vaccines targeting these serotypes may prevent pneumococcal disease and reduce associated costs."

Standardized response mean (SRM) was calculated for MRI outcome measures.Results Out of 20 ALS patients, 17 were available for follow-up. A significant decline in VOL of the dominant hand (rs=0.66, p<0.001) and head and neck muscles (partial η²=0.47, p=0.002) as well as CSA of the lower limbs (thighs: partial η²=0.56, p<0.001, calves: partial η²=0.54, p<0.001) was observed over iMOP, with highest responsiveness for progressive atrophy in hand (SRM -1.17) and leg muscles (thigh: SRM -1.09; calf: SRM -1.08). Furthermore, lower limb FF and T2m increased over time, with distal leg muscles being most affected (FF: partial η²=0.54, p=0.002, SRM 0.81; T2m: partial η²=0.37, p=0.01, SRM 0.74). Finally, longitudinal MRI changes showed correlation with strength in leg muscles (knee extension: r=0.77, p=0.001, 95% CI 0.46–0.91; plantar flexion: r=0.78, p<0.001, 95% CI 0.47 – 0.92), and fRMA decrease at thigh and calf level correlated with global clinical disease progression measured with ALSFRS (r=0.52, p=0.03, and r=0.68, p=0.004 respectively).Conclusions and Relevance Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of muscle MRI as a sensitive neuroimaging biomarker of disease progression in ALS, highlighting its potential application in clinical trials.Key Points Question: Can quantitative muscle MRI track disease progression over time in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)?Findings: Longitudinal quantitative MRI reliably detects progressive intramuscular fat infiltration, oedema and atrophy, which correlate with progressive loss of muscle strength.Meaning: Muscle MRI has the potential to be utilised as a biomarker for ALS disease progression and could contribute to reduce the size and duration of clinical trials facilitating future drug developments."

Despite extensive research on the interaction between disease spread, human behaviors, and interventions, few models have incorporated real-world behavioral data on disease perception, limiting their applicability. This study novelly integrates disease perception, represented by perceived severity, as a critical determinant of behavioral change into a data-driven compartmental model to assess its impact on disease spread. Using survey data, we explore scenarios involving a competition between a COVID-19 wave and a vaccination campaign, where individuals’ behaviors vary based on their perceived severity of the disease. Results demonstrate that behavioral heterogeneities influenced by perceived severity affect epidemic dynamics, with high heterogeneity yielding contrasting effects. Longer adherence to protective measures by groups with high perceived severity provides greater protection to vulnerable individuals, while premature relaxation of behaviors by low perceived severity groups facilitates virus spread. Epidemiological curves reveal that differences in behavior among groups can eliminate a second infection peak, resulting in a higher first peak and overall more severe outcomes. The specific modeling approach for how perceived severity modulates behavior parameters does not strongly impact the model’s outcomes. Sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of our findings, emphasizing the consistent impact of behavioral heterogeneities across various scenarios. Our study underscores the importance of integrating risk perception into infectious disease transmission models and highlights the necessity of extensive data collection to enhance model accuracy and relevance."

Comorbid depression is prevalent among adolescents living with HIV (ALWH) and poses numerous challenges to HIV care engagement and retainment. We present a pilot trial designed to investigate feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of an adapted and an enhanced Friendship Bench intervention (henceforth: AFB and EFB) in reducing depression and improving engagement in HIV care among ALWH in Malawi.Methods Design: Participants will be randomized to one of three conditions: the Friendship Bench intervention adapted for ALWH (AFB, n=35), the Friendship Bench intervention enhanced with peer support (EFB, n=35), or standard of care (SOC, n=35). Recruitment is planned for early 2024 in four clinics in Malawi.Participants: Eligibility criteria (1) aged 13-19; (2) diagnosed with HIV (vertically or horizontally); (3) scored ≥ 13 on the self-reported Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI-II); (4) living in the clinic’s catchment area with intention to remain for at least 1 year; and (5) willing to provide informed consent.Interventions: AFB includes 6 counseling sessions facilitated by young, trained non-professional counselors. EFB consists of AFB plus integration of peer support group sessions to facilitate engagement in HIV care. SOC for mental health in public facilities in Malawi includes options for basic supportive counseling, medication, referral to mental health clinics or psychiatric units at tertiary care hospitals for more severe cases.Outcomes: The primary outcomes are feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of the AFB and EFB assessed at 6 months and 12 months and compared across 3 arms. The secondary outcome is to assess preliminary effectiveness of the interventions in reducing depressive symptoms and improving HIV viral suppression at 6 months and 12 months.Discussion This pilot study will provide insights into youth-friendly adaptations of the Friendship Bench model for ALWH in Malawi and the value of adding group peer support for HIV care engagement. The information gathered in this study will lead to a R01 application to test our adapted intervention in a large-scale cluster randomized controlled trial to improve depression and engagement in HIV care among ALWH.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT06173544"

CS was used to assess overall survival and colon-specific survival rates in patients who survived beyond a certain time period. Cox regression was used to select factors for nomogram development, and performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA).Results The 5-year conditional overall survival rates initially increased slightly but then decreased over time. The rates at different time points after diagnosis (baseline and 1-5 years) were 62.5, 63.2, 62.8, 62.1, 61.6, and 59.8%. In contrast, 5-year conditional colon-specific survival rates consistently improved over the same period. These rates were 78.1, 80.9, 84.2, 86.9, 89.3, and 90.9%, respectively. Nomograms were developed for baseline measurements and for patients who survived 1, 3, and 5 years. The performance of these nomograms, assessed using AUC, calibration curves, and DCA, indicated good predictive capabilities.Conclusion CS provides valuable information on the medium- and long-term survival probabilities of elderly patients with non-metastatic colon cancer who underwent colectomy. The developed conditional nomograms allowed for the estimation of survival probabilities across different timeframes, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of prognosis and collaborative decision making."

Genomic analyses suggest a role of placental physiology on psychiatric risk. We investigated whether this association is causally related to impaired trophoblast function.Methods We conducted a two-sample summary-data Mendelian randomization study using as instrumental variables genetic variants strongly associated with birth weight, whose effect is exerted through the fetal genome, and are located near genes with differential expression in trophoblasts. Eight psychiatric and substance use disorders with >10,000 samples were included as outcomes. The inverse variance weighted method was used as the main analysis and several sensitivity analyses were performed for those significant results.Results The inverse variance weighted estimate, based on 14 instrumental variables, revealed an association, after correction for multiple tests, between birth weight and broadly-defined depression (beta=-0.165, 95% CI=-0.282 to -0.047, P=0.0059). Sensitivity analyses revealed absence of heterogeneity in the effect of instrumental variables, confirmed by leave-one-out analysis, MR_Egger intercept and MR_PRESSO. The effect was consistent using robust methods. Reverse causality was not detected. The effect was specifically linked to genetic variants near genes involved in trophoblast physiology instead of genes with fetal effect on birth weight or involved in placenta development.Conclusion Impaired trophoblast functioning, probably leading to reduced fetal brain oxygen and nutrient supply, is causally related to broadly-defined depression. Considering the therapeutic potential of some agents to treat fetal growth restriction, further research on the effect of trophoblast physiology on mental disorders may have future implications in prevention."

Early work suggests that aspirin could prevent COVID-19 related thromboembolic disorders in some studies but not others. This study leverages data from the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States to better understand this association. Our objective was to evaluate the incidence and risk of COVID-19 associated acute thromboembolic disorders and the potential impact of aspirin.Methods This retrospective, observational study utilized national electronic health record data from the Veterans Health Administration. 334,374 Veterans who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 2, 2020, to June 13, 2022, were included, 81,830 of whom had preexisting aspirin prescription prior to their COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with and without aspirin prescriptions were matched and the odds of post-COVID acute thromboembolic disorders were assessed.Results 10.1% of Veterans had a documented thromboembolic disorder within 12 months following their COVID-19 diagnosis. Those with specific comorbidities were at greatest risk. Preexisting aspirin prescription was associated with a significant decrease risk of post-COVID-19 thromboembolic disorders, including pulmonary embolism (OR [95% CI]: 0.69 [0.65, 0.74]) and deep vein thrombosis (OR [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.69, 0.83], but an increased risk of acute arterial diseases, including ischemic stroke (OR [95% CI]: 1.54 [1.46, 1.60]) and acute ischemic heart disease (1.33 [1.26, 1.39]).Conclusions Findings demonstrated that preexisting aspirin prescription prior to COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with significantly decreased risk of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism but increased risk of acute arterial disease. The risk of arterial disease may be associated with increased COVID-19 prothrombotic effects superimposed on preexisting chronic cardiovascular disease for which aspirin was already prescribed. Prospective clinical trials may help to further assess the efficacy of aspirin use prior to COVID-19 diagnosis for the prevention of post-COVID-19 thromboembolic disorders."

Semorinemab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to all known isoforms of full-length tau with high affinity and specificity. Semorinemab’s safety and efficacy have been studied in two Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials: Tauriel (prodromal-to-mild AD; NCT03289143) and Lauriet (mild-to-moderate AD; NCT03828747). CSF was collected from a subset of patients at baseline and after 49 or 73 weeks in Tauriel and baseline and after 49 or 61 weeks in Lauriet. We generated a large proteomics dataset, using more than 250 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and detecting more than 3500 proteins, to investigate the effects of semorinemab in each trial. Treatment-induced proteomic signatures were defined for each study as a set of proteins significantly elevated in the treatment arm in the respective study. Integration of the corresponding gene signatures with two independent brain single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets from AD and healthy aged controls revealed that Lauriet signature genes were enriched in microglial cells, while Tauriel signature genes were more broadly expressed across major brain cell types. Furthermore, the Lauriet trial gene signature was significantly upregulated in microglia from AD patients as compared to non-demented controls. The elevation of proteins such as CHI3L1 and GPNMB with treatment suggested an activated glial state. Taken together, this study utilizes a large CSF clinical proteomics dataset to assess the pharmacodynamic response of semorinemab and contributes to our understanding of how an anti-tau antibody influences disease-relevant pathophysiology in AD."

The aim of the study was to determine how the SIR parameters are changing as the virus evolved into variants. Each peak in cases was analyzed separately for each country and the parameters: reff (pandemic R-parameter), Leff (average number of days an individual is infective) and α (the rate of infection for contacts between the set of susceptible persons and the set of infected persons) were computed. Each peak was mapped to circulating variants for each country and the SIR parameters (reff, Leff, α) were averaged over each variant using their values in peaks where 70% of the variant sequences identified belonged to a single variant. This analysis showed that on average, compared to the original Wuhan variant (α = 0.2), the parameter α has increased to α = 0.5 for the Omicron variants. The value of reff has decreased from around 3.8 to 2.0 and Leff has decreased from 15 days to 10 days. This is as would be expected of a virus that is coming to equilibrium by evolving to increase its infectivity while reducing the effects of infections on the host."

However, the implementation of the PEN in Ethiopia is at an early stage and the readiness of rural primary healthcare units (PHCUs) to implement the strategy is unknown. We, therefore, propose to apply the strategy in the catchment areas of Dobe-Toga Health Center, a rural PHCU in Sidama National Regional State (SNRS), Ethiopia, and improve the NCDs care among adults aged≥45 years.Aim We aim to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension, pre-T2DM mellitus, T2DM, and comorbidity of hypertension and T2DM among the older adults in the study areas, apply the WHO-PEN- based care model for the participants diagnosed with T2DM and/or hypertension and evaluate its effectiveness in controlling blood glucose and/or pressure. The readiness of PHCUs to implement the WHO-PEN approach in the region will also be determined. Additionally, we examine the influence of diagnosis with hypertension and/or T2DM on the willingness of the study participants to join and/or renew membership in community-based health insurance (CBHI).Methods The study will be conducted in catchment areas of Dobe-Toga Health Center from April to November 2024. A cross-sectional survey of 41 health centers and 4 primary hospitals, triangulated with qualitative data, will be employed to assess the readiness of the PHCUs to implement the WHO-PEN interventions while the qualitative data for this study has not been collected yet, the quantitative data was collected through observation checklist of inputs. The remaining studies will be conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, cross- sectional surveys will be conducted to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension, T2DM, pre- T2DM, and comorbidity of T2DM and hypertension in a randomly selected sample of 3301 older adults. Additionally, the participants’ willingness to pay (WTP) for HbA1c tests will be assessed, and CBHI-related surveys will be conducted. In the second phase, the cohorts will be linked to the health center and will receive the WHO-PEN-based care model. In phase 2, the effects of the care model in controlling blood pressure and glucose will be examined. Furthermore, the adherence to self-care practices of the cohorts will be determined."

Although malnutrition during female adolescence leads to poor health outcomes with potential intergenerational effects on offspring, no studies have comprehensively investigated MNDs and nutritional status among contemporary Vietnamese female adolescents.Methods Data from 10-to 18-year-old female participants (n=1,471) in the nationally-representative Vietnam General Nutrition Survey 2020 were analysed. Blood nutritional biomarkers, anthropometric measurements, and socio-demographic data were collected and the associations between nutrition status and MNDs were analysed; with anaemia, iron deficiency (ID), iron deficiency anaemia, low serum zinc, low serum retinol, and any MNDs as specified outcomes.Findings Prevalence of overweight, stunting, and thinness was 27·2%, 14·3%, and 6·9%, respectively. Low serum zinc was common (39·8%), as was ID (9·8%). Bivariate analyses showed that older age (16-18 years old), ethnic minority, lower wealth index, and inflammation were associated with MNDs. In adjusted logistic regressions, stunting was associated with increased odds ratio (AOR) and [95% confidence intervals] of low serum retinol (8·92 [2·26, 35·15], p<0·01), as was thinness (12·25 [3·47, 43·33], p<0·01). Stunting was also associated with increased odds of having any MNDs (1·88 [1·13, 3·12], p<0·05).Interpretation More female adolescents were overweight than undernourished in Vietnam in 2020. However, undernutrition, low serum zinc, and ID remain prevalent. Food systems approaches should be considered to stem the stark increase in the double burden of malnutrition in young people living in Vietnam.Funding UK BBSRC BB/T008989/1."

The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors for LASV infection in an endemic community in Sierra Leone.Methods We conducted a case-control study by enrolling 37 laboratory-confirmed LF cases identified through the national LF surveillance system in Sierra Leone, and 140 controls resided within a one-kilometre radius of the case household. We performed conditional multiple logistic regression analysis to identify the risk factors for LASV infection.Results Of the 37 cases enrolled, 23 died (62% case fatality rate). Cases were younger than controls (19.5 years vs 28.9 years, p<0.05) and more frequently female (64.8% vs. 52.8%). Compared to the controls, LF cases had contact with rodents (rats or mice) in their households more frequently in the preceding three weeks (83.8% vs.47.8%). Households with a cat reported a lower presence of rodents (73% vs 38%, p<0.01) and contributed to a lower rate of LF (48.6% vs 55.7%) although not statistically significant (p=0.56). The presence of rodents in the households (Matched Adjusted Odds Ratio [mAOR]: 11.1), and younger age (mAOR: 0.99) were independently associated with LASV infection.Conclusion Rodent access to households is likely a key risk factor for LASV infection in rural Sierra Leone and potentially in other countries within the West African region. Controlling rodent access to households might help reduce household-level LASV infection in Sierra Leone."

AbstractBackground Expert interrater agreement for epileptiform discharges can be moderate. This reasonably will affect the performance when developing classifiers based on annotations performed by experts. In addition, evaluation of classifier performance will be difficult since the ground truth will have a variability. In this pilot study, these aspects were investigated to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a larger study on the subject.Methods A multi-channel EEG of 78 minutes duration with abundant periodic discharges was independently annotated for epileptiform discharges by two experts. Based on this, several deep learning classifiers were developed which in turn produced new annotations. The agreements of all annotations were evaluated by pairwise comparisons using Cohen’s kappa and Gwet’s AC1. A cluster analysis was performed on all periodic discharges using a newly developed version of parametric t-SNE to assess the similarity between annotations.Results The Cohen’s kappa values were 0.53 for the experts, 0.52–0.65 when comparing the experts to the classifiers, and 0.67–0.82 for the classifiers. The Gwet’s AC1 values were 0.92 for the experts, 0.92–0.94 when comparing the experts to the classifiers, and 0.94–0.96 for the classifiers. Although there were differences between all annotations regarding which discharges that had been selected as epileptiform, the selected discharges were mostly similar according to the cluster analysis. Almost all identified epileptiform discharges by the classifiers were also periodic discharges.Conclusions There was a discrepancy between agreement scores produced by Cohen’s kappa and Gwet’s AC1. This was probably due to the skewed prevalence of epileptiform discharges, which only constitutes a small part of the whole EEG. Gwet’s AC1 is often considered the better option and the results would then indicate an almost perfect agreement. However, this conclusion is questioned when considering the number of differently classified discharges. The difference in annotation between experts affected the learning of the classifiers, but the cluster analysis indicates that all annotations were relatively similar. The difference between experts and classifiers is speculated to be partly due to intrarater variability of the experts, and partly due to underperformance of the classifiers. For a larger study, in addition to using more experts, intrarater agreement should be assessed, the classifiers can be further optimized, and the cluster method hopefully be further improved."

This may increase the accessibility of the proteins to digestive enzymes, thereby resulting in enhanced gastric digestion and amino acid (AA) absorption. However, this needs to be confirmed in vivo in humans.Objective This study aimed to examine gastric digestion and amino acid concentrations of cow milk-derived casein (cow MC) and goat milk-derived casein (goat MC).Methods In this single-blind randomized cross-over study 18 men (age 23 ± 1.6 years, BMI 23 ± 1.6 kg/m2) consumed 300 ml of a drink containing either 30 g of cow MC or goat MC. Participants underwent gastric MRI scans at baseline and t = 3, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes after the start of consumption. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and up to 4 hours postprandially to determine AA concentrations. In addition, participants verbally rated their appetite after each MRI measurement. Primary outcomes were gastric emptying and AA concentrations. The secondary outcome was gastric coagulation as inferred by image texture measures.Results Gastric emptying half-time was 80 ± 25 minutes for goat MC and 85 ± 24 minutes for cow MC (p = 0.395). In line with this, gastric emptying of the drinks over time was similar (MD 0.77, 95% CI [-6.9, 8.5], p = 0.845). Serum essential AA (MD -110 µmol/L, 95% CI [-162, - 58]) and branched chain AA (MD -65 µmol/L, 95% CI [-101, -29]) were significantly higher over time for cow MC (both p < 0.001). The image texture measure contrast was significantly lower for the cow MC compared with the goat MC drink (MD 0.010, 95% CI [0.001, 0.020], p = 0.036).Conclusion Cow MC and goat MC have different coagulating properties, as measured by AA concentrations and supported by image texture analysis. This possible difference in coagulation did not influence overall gastric emptying or the emptying of the liquid and coagulated fractions, which were similar. This warrants further research to examine differences in casein coagulation in vivo in the food matrix of milk products to help determine the optimal use for cow and goat milk and their protein fractions."

N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) may refine ASCVD risk in low-to intermediate risk individuals eligible for HOPE-3, JUPITER and MEGA, and aid statin initiation in low- to intermediate risk populations.Methods 5434 participants, aged 45 years and above from the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study, free of ASCVD, heart failure, and diabetes, were included between 1997 and 2008. Eligibility criteria for MEGA, JUPITER, and HOPE-3 trials were checked for each participant. ASCVD event rates, hazard ratios (HR), 5-year numbers needed to treat (NNT5y), and screen (NNS5y) per trial eligible population and NT-proBNP category (≤50, 50-100, and >100 pg/mL) were calculated.Results Median age was 61.6 years, 58.9% were women, median NT-proBNP was 60 pg/mL. The proportions of participants eligible for MEGA, JUPITER and HOPE-3 were 34.9%, 10.4% and 23.7%. Incidence rates per 1000 person-years for ASCVD were 10.4 (95%CI: 60.1-67.9) for MEGA, 16.8 (95%CI: 13.6-20.6) for JUPITER, and 12.1 (95%CI: 10.3-14) for HOPE-3. Adjusted HR in trial eligible individuals for NT-proBNP >100 pg/mL compared to ≤50 pg/mL level were 1.73 (95%CI: 1.21-2.47), 1.46 (95%CI: 0.80-2.66) and 1.50 (95%CI: 0.99-2.26), respectively. Estimated NNT5y among trial eligible individuals with NT-proBNP levels >100 pg/mL based on high-intensity statin treatment, varied from 23 to 34 to prevent one ASCVD event, while NNS5y ranged between 56 and 134.Conclusions NT-proBNP level >100 pg/mL identifies individuals at the highest ASCVD risk among low- to intermediate risk populations who are likely to benefit from statin treatment at acceptable NNT5y and NNS5y.Clinical PerspectiveWhat is New?
NT-proBNP level >100 pg/mL can identify individuals at the highest ASCVD risk among low- to intermediate risk populations who are likely to benefit from statin treatment at acceptable numbers needed to treat and screen.Among apparently healthy individuals without prior ASCVD and diabetes mellitus, 60% was deemed to be at low- to intermediate risk by qualifying for at least one of three RCT based on the trial eligibility criteria, and one out four individuals had NT-proBNP level >100 pg/mL.What are the Clinical Implications?
NT-proBNP level can be used for risk refining in low- to intermediate risk individuals who are most likely to benefit from statin initiation for ASCVD primary prevention."

It is classically associated with semantic dementia and anterior temporal lobe (ATL) atrophy, but semantic knowledge can also be compromised in behavioural-variant FTD (bvFTD). Motivated by understanding behavioural change in FTD, recent research has focused selectively on social-semantic knowledge, with proposals that the right ATL is specialised for social concepts. Previous studies have assessed very different types of social concepts and have not compared performance to that on matched non-social concepts. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent various social concepts are (i) concurrently impaired in FTD, (ii) distinct from general semantic memory and (iii) differentially supported by the left and right ATL. This study assessed multiple aspects of social-semantic knowledge and general conceptual knowledge across cohorts with ATL-damage arising from either neurodegeneration or resection. We assembled a test battery measuring knowledge of multiple types of social concept. Performance was compared to non-social general conceptual knowledge, measured using the Cambridge Semantic Memory Test Battery and other matched non-social-semantic tests. Our transdiagnostic approach included bvFTD, semantic dementia and “mixed” intermediate cases to capture the FTD clinical spectrum, as well as age-matched healthy controls. People with unilateral left or right ATL resection for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) were also recruited to assess how selective damage to the left or right ATL impacts social- and non-social-semantic knowledge. Social- and non-social-semantic deficits were severe and highly correlated in FTD. Much milder impairments were found after unilateral ATL resection, with no left vs. right differences in social-semantic knowledge or general semantic processing, and with only naming showing a greater deficit following left vs. right damage. A principal component analysis of all behavioural measures in the FTD cohort extracted three components, interpreted as capturing: (1) FTD severity, (2) semantic memory and (3) executive function. Social and non-social measures both loaded heavily on the same semantic memory component, and scores on this factor were uniquely associated with bilateral ATL grey matter volume but not with the degree of ATL asymmetry. Together, these findings demonstrate that both social- and non-social-semantic knowledge degrade in FTD (semantic dementia and bvFTD) following bilateral ATL atrophy. We propose that social-semantic knowledge is part of a broader conceptual system underpinned by a bilaterally-implemented, functionally-unitary semantic hub in the ATLs. Our results also highlight the value of a transdiagnostic approach for investigating the neuroanatomical underpinnings of cognitive deficits in FTD."

An improved mechanistic understanding of the human disease will facilitate new treatments. To this end, biophysically-informed dynamic causal models can support inferences around laminar and cell-specific disease effects from human non-invasive imaging. Based on pre-clinical models and effects of cholinesterase inhibitors, we hypothesised that Alzheimer’s disease would affect the modulation of superficial pyramidal cell gain and extrinsic connectivity between pyramidal cells of different regions in hierarchical cognitive networks. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded during an auditory mismatch negativity task from healthy adults (n=14) and people with symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment (n=45, all amyloid-biomarker positive) at baseline and after 16 months. Fourteen people from the symptomatic group had repeat magnetoencephalography at two weeks to assess test-retest reliability. Sensor-level data were analysed using t-tests of the mismatch negativity amplitude from 140ms to 160ms. The repetition effect was assessed with repeated-measures analysis of covariance, using the average evoked response in the mismatch negativity time window as the repeated measure. An absolute, intraclass correlation model of the test-retest data assessed mismatch negativity amplitude reliability. We then fitted dynamic causal models to the evoked responses over 500ms. Second-level parametric empirical Bayes across participants examined the effect of (1) group, patients vs controls, and (2) progression, baseline vs follow-up, on the model parameters reflecting pyramidal cell gain modulation and extrinsic connectivity. There was a significant effect of both disease and progression on the mismatch negativity amplitude (patients vs controls, T=-1.80, p=0.04; patient baseline vs follow-up, T=-2.72, p=.005), which had excellent reliability (ICC=0.95, p<.001). Parametric empirical Bayes revealed strong evidence (posterior probability>95%) that Alzheimer’s disease reduced extrinsic connectivity and superficial pyramidal cell gain modulation, which was reduced further at follow up assessment. The mechanistic modelling confirmed the hypothesis that reduced superficial pyramidal cell gain modulation and extrinsic connectivity can explain the observed neurophysiological effect of Alzheimer’s disease. This approach to non-invasive magnetoencephalography data may be used for experimental medicine studies of candidate treatments, and bridge clinical to preclinical models of drug efficacy."

Research staff face challenges due to the high volume of eligible patients and the complexity of varying eligibility criteria. The traditional manual process, both time-consuming and error-prone, often leads to missed opportunities. Utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of this process through automated patient screening against established criteria.Methods Utilizing data from the National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) 2018 Challenge, we utilized 202 longitudinal patient records. These records were annotated by medical professionals and evaluated against 13 selection criteria encompassing various health assessments. Our approach involved embedding medical documents into a vector database to determine relevant document sections, then using a large language model (GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 OpenAI API) in tandem with structured and chain-of-thought prompting techniques for systematic document assessment against the criteria. Misclassified criteria were also examined to identify classification challenges.Results This study achieved an accuracy of 0.81, sensitivity of 0.80, specificity of 0.82, and a micro F1 score of 0.79 using GPT-3.5 Turbo, and an accuracy of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.85, specificity of 0.89, and micro F1 score of 0.86 using GPT-4 Turbo. Notably, some criteria in the ground truth appeared mislabeled, an issue we couldn’t explore further due to insufficient label generation guidelines on the website.Conclusion Our findings underscore the significant potential of AI and NLP technologies, including large language models, in the clinical trial matching process. The study demonstrated strong capabilities in identifying eligible patients and minimizing false inclusions. Such automated systems promise to greatly alleviate the workload of research staff and improve clinical trial enrollment, thus accelerating the process and enhancing the overall feasibility of clinical research."

It is affecting millions and predisposing such patients to several complications, including ocular complications. Physical activity has been found to improve glycemic levels, but the specific effect on visual outcomes in a newly diagnosed African population with AGT is yet to be explored fully. This pilot randomized controlled trial seeks to evaluate the efficacy of a physical activity intervention among newly diagnosed persons with AGT in Cape Coast, Ghana.Methods: An ostensibly healthy population will be screened for AGT. Persons newly diagnosed with AGT will be recruited into the randomized controlled trial. About 50 newly diagnosed participants with AGT will undergo a 12-week moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) intervention, specifically exercises that burn more than 3.0 metabolic equivalents (METs), to ascertain its effect on their visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, central visual field and diabetic retinopathy status. The participants will be randomized into a physical activity intervention group and a control group. Assessments will be done at baseline, and treatment outcomes will be done on the last day of the intervention for each participant.Discussion: Physical activity is a proven lifestyle intervention that reduces glycemic levels in people with AGT. Unfortunately, many persons are unaware of their high level of glucose tolerance, which is associated with the deterioration of vision. This study intends to investigate and present findings on the advantages of physical activity interventions on visual outcomes among people with AGT. The study holds promise in informing evidence-based interventions for persons with AGT in poor economies."

Automated estimation of density in women below normal screening age would enable earlier risk stratification. We are piloting the use of low dose mammograms combined with models that can make accurate mammographic density estimates.Methods Three models were trained on a joint set (107,619) of standard dose mammograms with associated density scores and their simulated low dose counterparts such that the models made predictions on standard and low dose mammograms. A second set of models was trained separately on the standard and simulated low dose mammograms. All models were tested on a held-out set from the training data and an independent dataset with 294 pairs of standard and real low dose mammograms.Results The root mean squared errors (RMSE) between the model predictions and density scores on standard and simulated low dose images were 8.26 (8.16-8.36) and 8.27 (8.17-8.38) respectively. The RMSE between predictions on standard and simulated low dose images for the jointly trained models was 1.91 (1.88-1.96). The RMSE of the predictions on the real low dose images compared to the standard dose images is 3.79 (2.75-4.99).Conclusions Deep learning models make density predictions on low dose images with similar quality as on standard dose images. Such automated analysis of low dose mammograms could contribute to accurate breast cancer risk estimation in younger women enabling stratification for further monitoring and preventative therapy.Advances in knowledge Mammographic density can be estimated in low dose mammograms with similar quality to standard dose mammograms."

As an initial predictive model, a polytomous logistic regression model, incorporating clinical parameters to estimate a probability of ND occurring within and beyond 12 hours post-stroke onset, was developed. To refine ND risk assessments over time, we subsequently introduced an iterative risk-tracking model that utilizes continuously updated blood pressure measurements. We endeavored to integrate these models, assessing their combined discriminative capacity and clinical utility, with a particular emphasis on pinpointing time periods of increased ND risk.Results ND rates were observed at 6.1% within the first 12 hours and 7.3% during the following 60 hours. We noted variations in incidence rates and their distribution over time across predefined patient groups. Significant predictors of ND varied among these subgroups and across different time periods. The iterative risk-tracking model maintained a consistent relationship between blood pressure variables and ND risk across different patient groups, successfully forecasting ND within a 12-hour window. The integrated models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging from 0.68 to 0.76. This performance effectively narrowed down the critical window for ND risk identification without sacrificing predictive accuracy across diverse patient groups. At 90% and 70% sensitivity settings, the combined model precisely identified the periods of highest ND risk, showing slightly higher or comparable specificity and positive predictive values relative to other models.Conclusion This study presents a novel approach for real-time monitoring of ND risk in ischemic stroke patients, utilizing BP trends to identify critical periods for potential intervention."

This prospective randomized German multi—center trial sought to compare two ablation strategies in this patient cohort.Methods Patients with AF despite durable PV isolation were randomly assigned at seven centers to undergo low-voltage area (LVA) ablation using 3D mapping and irrigated radiofrequency current ablation (group A) or empirical left atrial appendage isolation (LAAI) utilizing the cryoballoon (CB) followed by staged interventional LAA closure (group B). The primary endpoint was freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmias between 91 and 365 days after index ablation. The study was powered for superiority of LAAI compared to LVA.Results Patients (40% female, mean age 68.8±8 years) with paroxysmal (32%) or persistent AF (68%) were randomized to undergo LVA ablation (n=79) or CB guided LAAI (n=82). After a planned interim analysis enrollment was halted on January 10th 2023.In the LAAI group 77/82 LAAs were successfully isolated with subsequent LAAC in 57 patients. Procedure related complications occurred in 4 (5%) and 11 (13.5%) patients in group A and B, respectively (P=0.10). The median follow-up was 367 (IQR 359-378) days. The Kaplan Meier point estimate for the freedom from a primary endpoint event was 51.7% (CI 40.9-65.4%) for group A and 55.5% (CI 44.4-69.2%; p=0.8069).Conclusions The present study did not detect superiority of CB guided LAAI over LVA ablation in patients with AF despite durable PVI.It was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04056390What is new?This is the first randomized multi-center study to compare two different ablation strategies in AF patients with durable PVI.Empirical LAAI was not associated with better outcome in comparison to low-voltage area ablation.What are the clinical implications?LAAI should not be advocated as a stand-alone ablation strategy for patients with AF recurrences after prior ablation.The patient with AF recurrence after prior catheter ablation should be informed that if all PVs are found durably isolated the optimal ablation strategy remains uncertain."

Because of the division into SHI and PHI, person insurance’s status is an important variable for studies in the context of public health research. In the German National Cohort (NAKO), the variable on self-reported health insurance status of the participants has a high proportion of missing values (55.4%). The aim of our study was to develop and internally validate models to predict the health insurance status of NAKO baseline survey participants in order to replace missing values. In this respect, our research interest was focused on the question to which extent socio-demographic characteristics are suitable for predicting health insurance status.Methods We developed two prediction models including 53,796 participants to estimate the probability that a participant is either member of a SHI (model 1) or PHI (model 2). We identified eight predictors by literature research: occupation, income, education, sex, age, employment status, residential area, and marital status. The predictive performance was determined in the internal validation considering discrimination and calibration. Discrimination was assessed based on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration was assessed based on the calibration slope and calibration plot.Results In model 1, the AUC was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.91-0.92) and the calibration slope was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.97-0.97). Model 2 had an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.90-0.91) and a calibration slope of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.97-0.97). Based on the calculated performance parameters both models turned out to show an almost ideal discrimination and calibration. Employment status and household income and to a lesser extent educational level, age, sex, marital status, and residential area are suitable for predicting health insurance status.Conclusions Socio-demographic characteristics especially employment status and household income assessed at NAKO’s baseline were suitable for predicting the statutory and private health insurance status. However, before applying the prediction models in other studies, an external validation in population-based studies is recommended."

Dietary nitrate intakes and alternative healthy eating index (AHEI) scores were calculated from food frequency questionnaire responses and a validated US food database. Subgingival 16S rRNA microbial genes (Illumina, MiSeq) were sequenced, and PICRUSt2 estimated metagenomic content. The Microbiome Induced Nitric oxide Enrichment Score (MINES) was calculated as a microbial gene abundance ratio representing enhanced net capacity for NO generation. Cardiometabolic risk biomarkers included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c, glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and were regressed on nitrate intake tertiles in adjusted multivariable linear models.Results Mean nitrate intake was 190[171] mg/day. Higher nitrate intake was associated with lower insulin, and HOMA-IR but particularly among participants with low abundance of oral nitrite enriching bacteria. For example, among participants with a low MINES, mean insulin[95%CI] levels in high vs. low dietary nitrate consumers were 5.8[5.3,6.5] vs. 6.8[6.2,7.5] (p=0.004) while respective insulin levels were 6.0[5.4,6.6] vs. 5.9[5.3,6.5] (p=0.76) among partcipants with high MINES (interaction p=0.02).Conclusion Higher dietary nitrate intake was only associated with lower insulin and insulin resistance among individuals with reduced capacity for oral microbe-induced nitrite enrichment. These findings have implications for future precision medicine-oriented approaches that might consider assessing the oral microbiome prior to enrollment into dietary interventions or making dietary recommendations.What is new?In this population-based study we identified an interaction between dietary nitrate intake and oral nitrite enriching bacteria on cardiometabolic outcomes.Higher dietary nitrate intake was associated with lower insulin and insulin resistance only among participants with low abundance of oral nitrite enriching bacteria.This study suggests that cardiometabolic benefits of nitrate consumption might depend on the host microbiome’s capacity to metabolize nitrates.What are the clinical implications?Among people with low microbiome capacity for nitrate metabolism, higher levels of nitrate might be necessary to realize cardiometabolic benefits.Lack of microbiome assessments in prior studies could partially explain inconsistent findings from previous nitrate supplementation trials and observational studies.Future precision-medicine oriented trials studying the effects of dietary nitrate recommendations on cardiometabolic health, should consider assessing the oral microbiome."

If patients do not trust this technology, its implementation may disrupt the patient-clinician relationship. Therefore, we examined whether receiving basic information about ML-based clinical decision support systems increased trust in them.Methods We conducted an online randomised survey experiment among patients receiving treatment in the Psychiatric Services of the Central Denmark Region. The participants were randomised to one of three arms, receiving different types of information: Intervention = information on clinical decision making supported by an ML model; Active control = information on a standard clinical decision process without ML-support; Blank control = no information. The participants were unaware of the randomization and the experiment. Subsequently, the participants were asked about different aspects of trust/distrust in ML-based clinical decision support systems. The effect of the intervention was assessed by comparing pairwise comparisons between all arms on component scores of trust and distrust.Findings Out of 5800 invitees, 992 completed the survey experiment. The intervention increased trust in ML-based clinical decision support systems when compared to the active control (mean absolute difference in trust: 5% [95%CI: 1%;9%], p-value= 0·009) and the blank control arm (mean absolute difference in trust: 4% [1%;8%], p-value=0·015). Similarly, the intervention significantly reduced distrust in ML-based clinical decision support systems when compared to the active control (mean absolute difference in distrust -3%[-5%; -1%], p-value=0·021) and the blank control arm (mean absolute difference in distrust -4% [-8%; -1%], p-value=0·022). For both trust and distrust, there were no material or statistically significant differences between the active and the blank control arms.Interpretation Receiving information on ML-based clinical decision support systems in hospital psychiatry may increase patient trust in such systems. Hence, implementation of this technology could ideally be accompanied by information to patients.Funding None.Evidence before this study Clinical decision support systems based on machine learning (ML) models are emerging within psychiatry. However, if patients do not trust this technology, its implementation may disrupt the patient-clinician relationship. Unfortunately, there is only little knowledge on opinions on ML models as decision support among patients receiving treatment in psychiatric services. Also, it remains unknown whether receiving basic information about ML-based clinical decision support systems increases patients’ trust in them. We searched PubMed on Sep 12, 2023, with the terms “((survey) OR (survey experiment)) AND (patients) AND ((opinions) OR (attitudes) OR (trust)) AND ((machine learning) OR (artificial intelligence)) AND ((Psychiatry) OR (Mental Disorders) OR (Mental Health))” with no language restrictions. This yielded a total of 73 records, none of which surveyed a patient population from psychiatric services. Only two studies were directly relevant for the topic at hand. One surveyed patients from a general hospital system in the United States about the use of ML-based prediction of suicide risk based on electronic health record data. The results showed that patients were generally supportive of this data use if based on consent and if there was an opportunity to opt out. The other study surveyed women from the general population about their opinion on the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies in mental healthcare. The results showed that the respondents were generally open towards such technologies but concerned about potential (medical harm) and inappropriate data sharing. Furthermore, the respondents identified explainability, i.e., understanding which information drives AI predictions, as being of particular importance.Added value of this study To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate opinions on ML-based clinical decision-support systems among patients receiving treatment in psychiatric services. On average, patients were open towards the use of ML-based clinical decision-support systems in psychiatry. Furthermore, the results suggest that providing basic information about this technology seems to increase patient trust in it, albeit with a small effect size. Finally, the results support prior reports on the importance of explainability for acceptance.Implications of all the available evidence Receiving information on ML-based clinical decision support systems in hospital psychiatry, including how they work (explainability), may increase patient trust in such systems. Hence, successful implementation of this technology likely requires information of patients."

Compared with White teens, Hispanic teens use contraception less frequently and often choose less effective forms of contraception. Access to contraception is a primary barrier to use which contributes to relatively high and disparate rates of pregnancy in Hispanic teens. This integrative review identifies facilitators and barriers of contraception access and use for Hispanic women, 13-17 years of age, living in the U.S.Methodology Following the Whittemore and Knafl (2005) methodology and PRISMA guidelines, peer reviewed studies were retrieved from PUBMED, CINAHL and EMBASE. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the study quality and thematic analysis was used to categorize barriers and facilitators.Findings Of 131 studies retrieved, 16 met inclusion criteria. Individual, interpersonal and healthcare provider factors were identified as primary categories of barriers and facilitators with contextual issues comprising an additional barrier category. Individual level barriers were disproportionately represented and further categorized into themes: beliefs/misconceptions, dislike of contraception, pregnancy risk perception, lack of knowledge, and lack of control. The most frequently reported facilitators were perceived parent comfort discussing sexual health and past experience of pregnancy.Discussion Limitations in this review may stem from heterogeneity in the acculturation and geography of participants and analysis by a single reviewer. Implications include considering the range of information sources and the influence they have on risk perception and risk mitigation for this population.Conclusion & Significance Adolescents describe many modifiable influences on contraception access and use. Misperceptions related to contraception, stemming from beliefs and perceptions, can be corrected through increased access to reliable sources of sex education, parental support, and direct access to nurses and healthcare providers. Awareness of these influences can inform further research and intervention development to address these health disparities."

Developing a robust liquid biopsy test requires collecting high-dimensional data from a large number of blood samples across heterogeneous groups of patients. We propose that the generative capability of variational auto-encoders enables learning a robust and generalizable signature of blood-based biomarkers that capture true biological signals while removing spurious confounders (e.g., library size, zero-inflation, and batch effects). In this study, we analyzed orphan non-coding RNAs (oncRNAs) from serum samples of 1,050 individuals diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at various stages, as well as sex-, age-, and BMI-matched controls to evaluate the potential use of deep generative models. We demonstrated that our multi-task generative AI model, Orion, surpassed commonly used methods in both overall performance and generalizability to held-out datasets. Orion achieved an overall sensitivity of 92% (95% CI: 85%–97%) at 90% specificity for cancer detection across all stages, outperforming the sensitivity of other methods such as support vector machine (SVM) classifier, ElasticNet, or XGBoost on held-out validation datasets by more than ∼30%."

The package provides functions that address common challenges we encountered while working with All of Us Research Program data. We tested the package with standard R unit tests and in real research projects.Results We describe how the package functions allow for an efficient workflow. We demonstrate the package’s utility by creating a cohort of All of Us participants with one year of electronic health record data prior to survey completion and no previous diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes.Discussion Despite the program’s easy-to-use tools like the Cohort Builder, using All of Us data for complex research questions requires a relatively high level of technical expertise. We developed an initial set of functions that solve problems we experienced with our own research and in mentoring student projects. In conjunction with the tutorials provided with the package, these tools can reduce the barrier for entry into the All of Us research community. The package will continue to grow and develop with the All of Us Research Program.Conclusion The allofus R package can help build community research capacity by increasing access to the All of Us Research Program data, the efficiency of its use, and the rigor and reproducibility of the resulting research."

Several approaches exist for this task but, given the complexity of the problem, the obtained values are always approximate estimations that hold in particular conditions. Our goal is to contribute to this task in the event of an emerging disease. We propose a methodology to estimate the contact rate parameters from the fraction of the incidence reported in each age group at the beginning of the epidemic spread. Working with an age-structured SIR model, we obtain an equation that relates the contact parameters to various epidemiological quantities that could be accessible through different sources. We apply the method to obtain information about the contact structure by age during the COVID-19 epidemic spread in Greater Buenos Aires (Argentina) in 2020. As we have the fractions of reported incidence by age but only rough estimations of other quantities involved in the method, we define several epidemiological scenarios based on various hypotheses. Using the different sets of contact parameters obtained, we evaluate control strategies and analyze the dependence of the results on our assumptions. The proposed method could be useful to obtain a fast first insight of a new emergent disease at the beginning of epidemic spread using the accessible information."

Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of a fourth booster dose of PHH-1V against the most prevalent Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants in Spain.Methods The HIPRA-HH-2 open-label extension study (NCT05142553) evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of PHH-1V as a fourth booster dose in subjects aged ≥18 years and followed for 6 months. Subjects received a fourth dose of PHH-1V 6–12 months after a previous regime of either two doses of BNT162b2 plus a third dose of PHH-1V (Cohort 1) or three doses of BNT162b2 (Cohort 2). Primary regulatory endpoint evaluated the neutralisation titres (GMT) against Omicron BA.1 on Day 14 of PHH-1V used as fourth dose in Cohort 2 vs the BNT162b2 used as third dose in initial HIPRA-HH-2 study. The immunogenicity of PHH-1V as fourth dose was also investigated by GMTs against Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1, BA.4/5 and XBB.1.5 on Days 14, 98 and 182 post-immunisation in the overall study population and in Cohorts 1 and 2 versus baseline. Safety of the fourth dose was also assessed.Findings From September 2022, 288 subjects received PHH-1V as a fourth dose (Cohort 1 n=106; Cohort 2 n=182). A significant increase in neutralising antibodies against Omicron BA.1 subvariant at Day 14 was observed from the third homologous booster with mRNA vaccine compared to the fourth heterologous booster with PHH-1V (1739.02 vs 4049.01; GMT ratio 0.43 (95% CI: 0.28; 0.65; p-value < 0.0001). PHH-1V used as fourth booster induced a statistically significant increase in neutralising antibody titres 14 days after immunisation for all variants compared with baseline [GMFR on Day 14 (95%CI) was 6.96 (5.23, 9.25) for Beta variant; 6.27 (4.79, 8.22) for Delta variant; 9.21 (5.57, 15.21) for Omicron BA.1 variant; 11.80 (8.29, 16.80) for Omicron BA.4/5 variant and 5.22 (3.97, 6.87) for Omicron XBB.1.5 variant]. Titres remained significantly higher compared with baseline at 3 and 6 months post-vaccination. Cohort comparison revealed no significant differences at 14, 98 and 182 days post-vaccination. The most frequent adverse events were injection site pain (Cohort 1: 84.0%; Cohort 2: 77.5%) and fatigue (Cohort 1: 17.9%; Cohort 2: 29.1%). No subjects experienced severe COVID-19 infection.Interpretation The PHH-1V vaccine as a booster induced a potent and sustained neutralising antibody response against previous circulating Beta, Delta variants and Omicron BA.1, BA.4/5, and XBB.1.5 subvariants in subjects previously vaccinated with three doses regardless of previous regimen. These findings suggest that PHH-1V could be an appropriate strategy for upcoming heterologous vaccination campaigns.Funding HIPRA SCIENTIFIC, S.L.U (HIPRA), Spain.Unmet needs Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 will continue to increase in the community through widespread vaccination and infection. Despite this, at the individual level, the humoral response against new variants is diminished in both vaccinated and infected individuals.Booster strategies have demonstrated a reduction in the risk of not only COVID-19 infection but also of long COVID-19 or persistent post-COVID manifestations. Furthermore, heterologous booster strategies for vaccination regimens offer broad neutralising responses. However, available evidence regarding new platforms beyond mRNA-based vaccines is currently limited.Evidence before this study The PHH-1V vaccine elicits high and long-lasting levels of neutralising antibodies against all COVID-19 variants studied, as well as a strong cellular immunity response, when used as a heterologous booster in previously vaccinated individuals receiving mRNA and viral vector vaccines. However, safety and immunogenicity data on a fourth booster dose of PHH-1V against the most prevalent Omicron variants in Spain were not available at the time of the study period.Added value of this study The PHH-1V dimeric adjuvanted vaccine delivered as a fourth booster dose can induce a potent and significant neutralising antibody response against previous circulating Beta, Delta variants and Omicron BA.1, BA.4/5, and also against XBB.1.5 subvariants from Day 14 through Day 182 compared with baseline regardless of the primary vaccination received (two doses of BNT162b2 plus a third dose of PHH-1V (Cohort 1) or three doses of BNT162b2 (Cohort 2)) and confirm the higher response of PHH-1V when used as a heterologous fourth-dose booster. This open-label extension study also demonstrated that PHH-1V is well tolerated and safe irrespective of the prior booster vaccination received.Implications of all the available evidence These data confirm the advantages of heterologous booster vaccination with PHH-1V and the broad-spectrum response of the PHH-1V vaccine against the different emerging variants of COVID-19, suggesting that PHH-1V could be an appropriate booster for upcoming heterologous vaccination campaigns."

Climate change is intensifying existing environmental problems including urban heat island effect and poor water quality. While numerous epidemiological studies have linked meteorological factors to diarrhoeal diseases in Bangladesh, assessment of the impacts of future climate change on diarrhoeal diseases is scarce. We provide the assessment of climate change impacts on diarrhoeal disease in Dhaka and project future health risks under climate change scenarios. About 3 million acute diarrhoea cases presenting to the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (icddr,b) during 1981 - 2010 were linked to daily temperature, rainfall and humidity and association investigated using time series adapted negative binomial regression models employing constrained distributed lag linear models. The findings were applied to climate projections to estimate future risks of diarrhoea under various global warming scenarios. There was a significantly raised risk of diarrhoea hospitalisation in all ages with daily mean temperature (RR: 3.4, 95% CI: 3.0 – 3.7) after controlling for the confounding effects of heavy rainfall, humidity, autocorrelations, day of the week effect, long-term time, and seasonal trends. Using the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1.034, temperature increases based on the global warming targets of 1.5 – 2°C could result in an increase of diarrhoea hospitalisations by 4.5 – 7.4% in all age groups by the 2100s. These effects were more pronounced among <5 children where the predicted temperature increases could raise diarrhoea hospitalisation by 5.7% - 9.4%. Diarrhoea hospitalisation will increase significantly in Dhaka even if the global warming targets adopted by the Paris Agreement is reached. This underscores the importance of preparing the city for management and prevention of diarrhoeal diseases."

This technology has numerous applications, particularly in medicine. This contribution provides an overview on the state of the art of 3DP in medicine and showcases its current use in different medical disciplines and for medical education. In this meta-review, we provide a detailed listing of systematic reviews on this topic as this technology has become increasingly applied in modern medicine. We identified 134 relevant systematic reviews on medical 3DP in the medical search engine PubMed until 2023. 3DP has applications in various medical specialties, but is mainly used in orthopedics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, dentistry, cardiology and neurosurgery. In surgical contexts, the adoption of 3DP contributes to a reduction in operation time, reduced blood loss, minimized fluoroscopy time and an overall improved surgical outcome. Nevertheless, the primary use of 3DP is observed in non-invasive applications, particularly in the creation of patient-specific models (PSM). These PSMs enhance the visualization of patients’ anatomy and pathology, thereby facilitating surgical planning and execution, medical education and patient counseling. The current significance of 3DP in medicine offers a compelling perspective on the potential for more individualized and personalized medical treatments in the future."

The patient was awaiting orthotopic liver transplant (OLT). There is no standardized antibiotic prophylaxis regimen however in line with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidance an antibiotic prophylactic regimen of Ceftazidime-Avibactam (CZA) 2.5g TDS with Aztreonam (ATM) 2g TDS IV was proposed.Methods To inform the individualised pharmacodynamic outcome likelihood prior to prophylaxis dosing the hollow fibre infection model (HFIM) was applied to simulate the in vivo antibiotic exposures of the CZA-ATM regimen. The HFIM was inoculated with ∼10 x 105 bacterial CFU/mL of the XDR E. coli strain and CFUs/mL were measured for a total of 120 hours to determine the in vitro PK/PD killing dynamics.Results A 4-log reduction in CFU/mL in the first ten hours of the regimen exposure was observed however the killing dynamics were slow and six eight-hourly infusions were required to reduce bacterial cells to below the limit of quantification. Thus, the HFIM supported the use of the regimen for infection clearance however highlighted the need for several infusions. Standard local practise is to administer prophylaxis antibiotics at induction of OLT however the HFIM provided data to rationalise earlier dosing therefore the patient was dosed at 24 hours prior to their OLT induction. The patient was subsequently discharged 8 days after surgery.Conclusions The HFIM provides a dynamic culture solution for informing individualised medicine by testing antibiotic combinations and exposures against the bacterial isolates cultured from the patient’s infection."

In Alzheimer’s disease, the most common tauopathy, synapse loss is the strongest pathological correlate of cognitive decline. Recently, PET imaging with synaptic tracers revealed clinically relevant loss of synapses in primary tauopathies; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to synapse degeneration in primary tauopathies remain largely unknown. In this study, we examined post-mortem brain tissue from people who died with frontotemporal dementia with tau pathology (FTDtau) caused by the MAPT intronic exon 10+16 mutation, which increases splice variants containing exon 10 resulting in higher levels of tau with four microtubule binding domains. We used RNA sequencing and histopathology to examine temporal cortex and visual cortex, to look for molecular phenotypes compared to age, sex, and RNA integrity matched participants who died without neurological disease (n=12 per group). Bulk tissue RNA sequencing reveals substantial downregulation of gene expression associated with synaptic function. Upregulated biological pathways in human MAPT 10+16 brain included those involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA damage response, and neuroinflammation. Histopathology confirmed increased pathological tau accumulation in FTDtau cortex as well as a loss of presynaptic protein staining, and region-specific increased colocalization of phospho-tau with synapses in temporal cortex. Our data indicate that synaptic pathology likely contributes to pathogenesis in FTDtau caused by the MAPT 10+16 mutation."

The resulting saturation-style data may help resolve variant classification disparities between populations, especially for variants of uncertain significance (VUS).Methods We analyzed clinical significance classifications in 213,663 individuals of European-like genetic ancestry versus 206,975 individuals of non-European-like genetic ancestry from All of Us and the Genome Aggregation Database. Then, we incorporated clinically calibrated MAVE data into the Clinical Genome Resource’s Variant Curation Expert Panel rules to automate VUS reclassification for BRCA1, TP53, and PTEN.Results Using two orthogonal statistical approaches, we show a higher prevalence (p≤5.95e-06) of VUS in individuals of non-European-like genetic ancestry across all medical specialties assessed in all three databases. Further, in the non-European-like genetic ancestry group, higher rates of Benign or Likely Benign and variants with no clinical designation (p≤2.5e-05) were found across many medical specialties, whereas Pathogenic or Likely Pathogenic assignments were higher in individuals of European-like genetic ancestry (p≤2.5e-05).Using MAVE data, we reclassified VUS in individuals of non-European-like genetic ancestry at a significantly higher rate in comparison to reclassified VUS from European-like genetic ancestry (p=9.1e-03) effectively compensating for the VUS disparity. Further, essential code analysis showed equitable impact of MAVE evidence codes but inequitable impact of allele frequency (p=7.47e-06) and computational predictor (p=6.92e-05) evidence codes for individuals of non-European-like genetic ancestry.Conclusions Generation of saturation-style MAVE data should be a priority to reduce VUS disparities and produce equitable training data for future computational predictors."

To develop data-driven hematology, we gathered electronic health data and created open-source data processing pipelines to create a comprehensive data resource for Danish LC Research (DALY-CARE) approved for epidemiological, molecular, and data-driven research. We included all Danish adults registered with LC diagnoses since 2002 (n=65,774) and combined 10 nationwide registers, electronic health records (EHR), and laboratory data on a high-powered cloud-computer to develop a secure research environment. We herein exemplify how DALY-CARE has been used to develop novel prognostic markers using biobank data, real-world evidence to evaluate the efficacy of care, and medical artificial intelligence algorithms deployed directly into EHR systems. The DALY-CARE data resource allows for development of both near real-time decision-support tools and extrapolation of clinical trial results to clinical practice, thereby improving care for patients with LC."

Pregnant individuals have historically been underrepresented in biomedical research, and pregnancy-related research is often limited by data availability, sample size, and inadequate representation of the diversity of pregnant people. We aimed to identify pregnancy episodes with high-quality electronic health record (EHR) data in All of Us Research Program data and evaluate the program’s utility for pregnancy-related research.Materials and Methods We used an algorithm to identify pregnancy episodes in All of Us EHR data. We described these pregnancies, validated them with additional data, and compared them to national statistics.Results Our study identified 18,970 pregnancy episodes from 14,234 participants; other possible pregnancy episodes had low-quality or insufficient data. Validation against people who reported a current pregnancy on an All of Us survey found low false positive and negative rates. Demographics were similar in some respects to national data; however, Asian-Americans were underrepresented, and older, highly educated pregnant people were overrepresented.Discussion Our approach demonstrates the capacity of All of Us to support pregnancy research and reveals the diversity of the pregnancy cohort. However, we noted an underrepresentation among some demographics. Other limitations include measurement error in gestational age and limited data on non-live births.Conclusion The wide variety of data in the All of Us program, encompassing EHR, survey, genomic, and Fitbit data, offers a valuable resource for studying pregnancy, yet care must be taken to avoid biases."

Limited high quality clinical data exists and many practices have been extrapolated from colorectal cancer without validation in appendiceal cohorts. Many controversies exist regarding their treatment, and practices vary widely between centers and care settings. A national consensus update of best management practices for appendiceal malignancies was performed to better standardize care.Methods The 2018 Chicago consensus guideline was updated via modified Delphi consensus, performed over two rounds using nationally circulated surveys. Supporting evidence was evaluated using rapid systematic reviews. Key systemic therapy concepts were summarized by content experts.Results Most supporting literature consists of observational studies, but increasingly high-quality studies are becoming available to drive management. Two consensus-based pathways were generated for localized appendiceal tumors, one for epithelial mucinous neoplasms and another for appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Of 138 participants responding in the first round, 133 (96%) engaged in the second round. Over 90% consensus was achieved for all pathway blocks. Key points include minimizing intervention invasiveness where permitted by pathologic classification and margin status, and determining what margin and pathologic findings are indications for consideration of cytoreduction with or without intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Surveillance and systemic therapy recommendations are also presented.Conclusion With growing but still primarily observational evidence currently dictating care, these consensus recommendations provide expert guidance in the treatment of appendiceal tumors without peritoneal involvement."

Regularly updated vaccines are anticipated to boost waning immunity and provide protection against circulating variants. This study evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of mRNA-1273.815, a 2023-2024 Omicron XBB.1.5-containing mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, at preventing COVID-19-related hospitalizations and any medically attended COVID-19 in adults ≥18 years, overall, and by age and underlying medical conditions.Methods This retrospective cohort study used the Veradigm Network EHR linked to claims data to identify US adults ≥18 years of age who received the mRNA-1273.815 vaccine (exposed) matched 1:1 to individuals who did not receive a 2023-2024 updated COVID-19 vaccine (unexposed). Patients in the unexposed cohort were randomly matched to eligible mRNA-1273.815 recipients. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for differences between the two cohorts. The exposed cohort was vaccinated between September 12, 2023, and December 15, 2023, and individuals in both cohorts were followed up for COVID-19-related hospitalizations and medically attended COVID-19 until December 31, 2023. A Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR). VE of the mRNA-1273.815 vaccine in preventing COVID-19-related hospitalizations and any medically attended COVID-19 was estimated as 100*(1-HR). Subgroup analyses were performed for adults ≥50, adults ≥65, and individuals with underlying medical conditions associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes.Results Overall, 859,335 matched pairs of mRNA-1273.815 recipients and unexposed adults were identified. The mean age was 63 years, and 80% of the study population was ≥50 years old. 61.5% of the mRNA-1273.815 cohort and 66.4% of the unexposed cohort had an underlying medical condition. Among the overall adult population (≥18 years), VE was 60.2% (53.4–66.0%) against COVID-19-related hospitalization and 33.1% (30.2%–35.9%) against medically attended COVID-19 over a median follow-up of 63 (IQR: 44–78) days. VE estimates by age and underlying medical conditions were similar.Conclusions These results demonstrate the significant protection provided by mRNA-1273.815 against COVID-19-related hospitalizations and any medically attended COVID-19 in adults 18 years and older, regardless of their vaccination history, and support CDC recommendations for vaccination with the 2023-2024 Omicron XBB.1.5-containing COVID-19 vaccine to prevent COVID-19-related outcomes, including hospitalizations."

Current guidelines suggest screening for primary aldosteronism (PA) only in cases of hypertension or hypokalemia. This study aimed to evaluate the spectrum from overt PA to mild dysregulated aldosterone production with a sensitive protocol irrespective of blood pressure (BP) and potassium in patients with IA.Methods 254 consecutive patients (excluding hypercortisolism) were evaluated. The spectrum of PA was defined as a suppressed renin plus the following criteria: 1)Overt PA: aldosterone-to-renin-ratio (ARR) >30 ng/dL-to-ng/mL/hr, plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) >15ng/dL, and/or 24h urinary aldosterone >10 ug/24h; 2)Moderate PA: ARR 20-30 ng/dL-to-ng/mL/hr, PAC 10-15 ng/dL; 3)Mild dysregulated aldosterone production: ARR <20 ng/dL-to-ng/mL/hr and PAC >5-10 ng/dL.Results 35% (n=89/254) met criteria for PA spectrum, 20% (34/89) were initially normotensive and 94% (84/89) normokalemic. Overt, moderate, and mild groups were 10%, 12%, and 13%. There were trends across groups of clinical severity: systolic BP (153±19, 140±14, 137±14 mmHg, p-trend<0.05), resistant hypertension (50%, 23%, 7% p-trend=<0.001), daily defined dose of antihypertensives (DDD) (3.2±1.6, 1.2±1.5, 0.4±0.6 p-trend=0.001), and lower eGFR (75.5±30.8, 97.8±38.5, 101±25.5, p-trend<0.01). At follow-up (mean 28±15 months), 87% had treatment with MR antagonists or surgery with decreased systolic BP relative to clinical severity, −31.3 ±23, −12.7 ±19, and −11.4 ±19 mmHg, (p-trend<0.001). Similar trends were observed for DDD, with significant increase in renin.Conclusions There is a prevalent spectrum of clinically-relevant PA and dysregulated aldosterone production in IA, irrespective of BP or potassium, usually undetected. Aldosterone-directed treatment improved BP and normalized renin even in milder cases.Download figureOpen in new tab"

MAR was effective in infertile individuals, with around two-thirds of them successfully conceiving with MAR. Women with PCD had an increased risk of ectopic pregnancies (7.6 per 100 pregnancies, 95% CI 4.7-12.2). Our results suggest that fertility status in PCD differs by affected PCD gene.What is known already PCD is a heterogeneous multiorgan disease caused by mutations in genes required for the function and structure of motile cilia. Previous studies identified a link between PCD and infertility, but original data on prevalence of infertility and risk of ectopic pregnancies, the use and efficacy of MAR and the association of fertility with PCD genotype, are extremely limited.Study design, size, duration We performed a cross-sectional survey about fertility within the Living with PCD study (formerly COVID-PCD). Living with PCD is an international, online, participatory study that collects information directly from people with PCD. People with PCD of any age from anywhere in the world can participate in the study. At the time of the survey, 482 adults with PCD were registered within the Living with PCD study.Participants/materials, setting, methods We sent a questionnaire on fertility on July 12, 2022, to all participants older than 18 years enrolled in the Living with PCD study. The fertility questionnaire covered topics related to pregnancy attempts, use of MAR, and pregnancy outcomes. Data was collected via the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform. We defined infertility as failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or use of MAR for at least one pregnancy (Zegers-Hochschild et al., 2017).Main results and the role of chance 265 of 482 adult participants (55%) completed the fertility questionnaire. Among 168 adults who had tried to conceive, 72 (61%) women and 39 (78%) men were infertile. Of the infertile men, 28 had tried MAR, and 17 of them (61%) fathered a child with the help of MAR. Among infertile women, 59 had used MAR, and 41 of them (69%) became pregnant with the help of MAR. In our population, women with PCD showed a relatively high risk of ectopic pregnancies: 1 in 10 women who became pregnant had at least one ectopic pregnancy and 7.6% of pregnancies were ectopic (95% CI 4.7-12.2). We evaluated the association between fertility and affected PCD genes in 46 individuals (11 men, 35 women) with available genetic and fertility information, and found differences between genotypes e.g. all 5 women with a mutation in CCDC40 were infertile and all 5 with DNAH11 were fertile.Limitations, reasons for caution The study has limitations, including potential selection bias as people experiencing problems with fertility might be more likely to fill in the questionnaire, which may have influenced our prevalence estimates. We were unable to validate clinical data obtained from participant self-reports due to the anonymous study design, which is likely to lead to recall bias.Wider implications of the findings The study underlines the need for addressing infertility in routine PCD care, with a focus on informing individuals with PCD about their increased risk. It emphasizes the utility and efficacy of MAR in PCD-related infertility. Additionally, women attempting conception should be made aware of the increased risk of ectopic pregnancies and seek systematic early consultation to confirm intrauterine pregnancy. Fertility, efficacy of MAR and risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes differ between people with PCD—depending on genotypes—, and close monitoring and support might be needed from fertility specialist to increase chances of successful conception.Study funding/competing interest(s) Our research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Switzerland (SNSF 320030B_192804/1), the Swiss Lung Association, Switzerland (2021-08_Pedersen), and we also received support from the PCD Foundation, United States; the Verein Kartagener Syndrom und Primäre Ciliäre Dyskinesie, Germany; the PCD Support UK, United Kingdom; and PCD Australia, Australia.

All authors declare no conflict of interest.Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04602481What does this mean for patients?Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disease. People who live with it can have problems conceiving. It is unclear how many people with PCD struggle to have children, and how many can only have children with help. We also do not know if women with PCD more often have ectopic pregnancies (= pregnancies outside of the uterus) than the general population. How did we answer these questions? We sent a questionnaire about fertility to all participants in the Living with PCD study. The Living with PCD study is an online study. It collects information directly from people with PCD from all over the world. How many people with PCD struggled to have children? Eight out of ten men and six out of ten women had problems conceiving. How many were successful with help?Among those who struggled, two out of three were able to have a child with help of fertility treatments. Did women with PCD more often have ectopic pregnancies? Women with PCD more often had an ectopic pregnancy than the general population. In our study, seven out of 100 pregnancies were ectopic, compared to only two in 100 pregnancies in the general population. We believe that more people with fertility problems completed our questionnaire. Thus, the true risk of ectopic pregnancy in PCD might be lower than we found in our study. But ectopic pregnancies can lead to serious complications. Thus, the authors of this paper think that fertility specialists should inform women with PCD about their increased risk. Women with PCD should see their gynaecologist early in their pregnancy to confirm that the pregnancy is inside the uterus. The authors suggest to address fertility problems in routine PCD care, with the help of fertility specialists."

A recent hypothesis proposes independent genetic risk components from schizophrenia and affective disorders. By whole exome sequencing of a family with schizoaffective disorder, we identified four genes with protein-truncating variants (PTVs) that fit autosomal dominant inheritance model. Among these four genes, SSPO (encoding SCO-spondin) has exclusive expression in the subcommissural organ (SCO), a functionally highly intriguing organ in the brain, known to be potentially involved in CSF homeostasis. We generated a knock-in mouse model for the identified PTV of SSPO, and the mutant mice exhibited enhanced anxiety-like and anti-depression-like behaviors. We further performed multilayer transcriptomics analyses on the mouse brain, and found that the genes involved in stress response, anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder are dysregulated in the SCO and brain barriers, which have direct contact with CSF. Several cell-cell communication pathways involving brain barrier cells, including the WNT signaling pathways, are altered in the mutant mice. Our results demonstrate that SCO-spondin plays a key role in stress response and mood regulation through modulating brain barriers, and thus strongly suggest that the PTV of SSPO may contribute to the affective symptoms of schizoaffective disorder."

While AI models may be applied to assist or enhance the delivery of healthcare, there is also a risk of misuse. LLMs could be used to allocate resources based on unfair, inaccurate, or unjust criteria. For example, a social credit system uses big data to assess “trustworthiness” in society, punishing those who score poorly based on evaluation metrics defined only by a power structure (corporate entity, governing body). Such a system may be amplified by powerful LLMs which can rate individuals based on high-dimensional multimodal data - financial transactions, internet activity, and other behavioural inputs. Healthcare data is perhaps the most sensitive information which can be collected and could potentially be used to violate civil liberty via a “clinical credit system”, which may include limiting or rationing access to standard care. This report simulates how clinical datasets might be exploited and proposes strategies to mitigate the risks inherent to the development of AI models for healthcare."

Traditional workflows around the initiation and management of NIV include elective admission for therapy initiation and frequent face-to-face clinic visits for follow-up, but use of telemedicine offers an alternative approach.Aim This retrospective cohort study evaluated the clinical efficacy and health resource use impact of a remote monitoring approach to the initiation and monitoring of home NIV.Methods Individuals with COPD, COPD-obstructive sleep apnoea or obesity-related respiratory failure who were started on remote-monitored home NIV from July 2016 to December 2020 were included. Data were obtained from electronic health records. The primary outcome was healthcare utilisation (hospital admissions and average number of bed days) in the 12 months after versus 12 months before starting NIV; secondary endpoints included 2-year survival and time to readmission, and blood gas analysis.Results In the 12 months after versus before NIV initiation, there was a significant reduction in the mean number of admissions (1.0±2.1 vs. 1.4±2.1; p<0.0001) and occupied bed days (9.6±26.8 vs. 17.2±27.5; p<0.0001); results were consistent across NIV indications. Time to first readmission (hazard ratio [HR] 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58–2.8; p<0.001) and time to death (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.51–3.34; p<0.0001) were significantly worse in NIV non-users versus users, but did not differ by deprivation quintile. Blood gas analysis showed that NIV significantly reduced carbon dioxide pressure and bicarbonate compared with before NIV.Conclusions A technology-assisted service model for the remote initiation and monitoring of home NIV therapy for individuals with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure was feasible, had a beneficial effect on healthcare utilisation and outcomes, and offset typical adverse relative survival outcomes associated with deprivation.What is already known on this topic When given at adequate pressures that ensure sufficient reduction in carbon dioxide pressure, home non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an effective and well tolerated treatment for chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or obesity-related respiratory failure.What this study adds This study showed the feasibility and effectiveness of a remote monitoring approach to the initiation and management of home NIV therapy in a real-world setting.How this study might affect research, practice or policy As well as improving outcomes in appropriately selected individuals, the initiation and management of home NIV therapy using remote monitoring has the potential to improve workflow, equitably enhance access to and outcomes from treatment, and provide a rich continuous dataset that could facilitate derivation of actionable artificial intelligence insights to support proactive care interventions."

Additionally, there is a lack of research examining the disparities in management patterns, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and cost among these patients. Therefore, this study aims to assess the incidence of clinical outcomes in NVAF patients with different CHA2DS2-VASc scores and explore their management patterns, HCRU, and cost.Methods and Results This retrospective cohort study assessed patients diagnosed with NVAF between January 2018 and July 2022, utilizing a merged dataset from China. Patients were stratified into 3 cohorts by CHA2DS2-VASc scores: low-risk (0 for males, 1 for females), intermediate-risk (1 for males, 2 for females), and high-risk (≥2 for males, ≥3 for females). One-year incidence rates of clinical outcomes (including ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, arterial embolism, and major bleeding) were calculated as events per 100 person-years. Cumulative incidence and crude and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the Fine and Gray models. Management patterns, HCRU, and cost were analyzed descriptively. Among 419,490 NVAF patients (mean age: 75.2 years, 45.1% female), 16,541 (3.9%) were classified as low-risk, 38,494 (9.2%) as intermediate-risk, and 364,455 (86.9%) as high-risk. The mean (SD) age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score was 4.7 (2.0), increasing with CHA2DS2-VASc scores. The one-year cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was 3.2% (95% CI, 2.9%–3.5%) for low-risk, 4.9% (95% CI, 4.7%–5.2%) for intermediate-risk (aHR, 1.3, 95% CI, 1.2–1.4), and 12.2% (95% CI, 12.1%–12.3%) for high-risk (aHR, 2.5, 95% CI, 2.3–2.8). Meanwhile, the incidence of transient ischemic attack, arterial embolism, and major bleeding showed a similar increasing trend from low-risk to high-risk. Within one year after the index date, 16.4% of patients in the low-risk cohort received oral anticoagulants (OACs), while 11.1% of patients in the high-risk cohort received OACs. The mean (SD) number of all-cause hospitalizations was 0.1 (0.1), 0.1 (0.2), and 0.1 (0.3) per-patient-per-month (PPPM) for low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk, respectively. The mean (SD) length of stay increased from 0.9 (1.1) days PPPM for the low-risk to 1.2 (1.8) days PPPM for the high-risk.Conclusion This study demonstrates that contemporary Asian NVAF patients with higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores experience higher incidence of adverse outcomes and increased hospital resource consumption. There is insufficient utilization of OACs and other AF management measures across all CHA2DS2-VASc scores groups. These findings provide new evidence for improving patient management and guiding resource allocation in healthcare.What Is New?This large-scale study assessed the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes among contemporary Asian atrial fibrillation patients by CHA2DS2-VASc scores.This study demonstrated suboptimal management across all CHA2DS2-VASc score groups, with higher hospital resource utilization observed in groups with higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores.What Are the Clinical Implications?This study indicated that AF patients with elevated CHA2DS2-VASc scores face a greater risk of adverse clinical outcomes.Our findings informed decision-making on healthcare resource allocation and AF management."

Long-term follow-up data have also shown improved freedom from arrhythmia with proactive esophageal cooling compared to luminal esophageal temperature (LET) monitoring during pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). One hypothesized mechanism is improved lesion contiguity (as measured by the Continuity Index) with the use of cooling. We aimed to compare the Continuity Index of PVI cases using proactive esophageal cooling to those using LET monitoring.Methods Continuity Index was calculated for PVI cases at two different hospitals within the same health system using a slightly modified Continuity Index to facilitate both real-time calculation during observation of PVI cases and retrospective determination from recorded cases. The results were then compared between proactively cooled cases and those using LET monitoring.Results Continuity Indices for a total of 101 cases were obtained; 77 cases using proactive esophageal cooling and 24 cases using traditional LET monitoring. With proactive esophageal cooling, the average Continuity Index was 2.7 (1.3 on the left pulmonary vein, and 1.5 on the right pulmonary vein). With LET monitoring, the average Continuity Index was 27.3 (14.3 on the left, and 12.9 on the right), for a difference of 24.6 (p < 0.001).Conclusion Proactive esophageal cooling during PVI is associated with significantly improved lesion contiguity when compared to LET monitoring. This finding may offer a mechanism for the greater freedom from arrhythmia seen with proactive cooling in long-term follow-up."

Localization using a single slice selective pulse was compared to voxel-based localization that used three orthogonal refocusing pulses, and low bandwidth refocusing pulses were used to take advantage of the chemical shift displacement of water. A technique for water sideband removal was added, and a method of coil channel combination for large volumes was introduced.Results Proposed methods were compared qualitatively to previously-reported techniques at 7T. Sinc pulses resulted in reduced water signal excitation and improved spectral quality, with a symmetric, low bandwidth-time product pulse performing best. Single slice localization allowed shorter TEs with large volumes, enhancing signal, while low bandwidth slice selective localization greatly reduced the observed water signal. Gradient cycling helped remove water sidebands, and frequency aligning and pruning individual channels narrowed spectral linewidths. High quality brain spectra of NAD+ and tryptophan are shown in four subjects at 3T.Conclusion Improved spectral quality with higher downfield signal, shorter TE, lower nuisance signal, reduced artifacts, and narrower peaks was realized at 7T. These methodological improvements allowed for previously unachievable detection of NAD+ and tryptophan in human brain at 3T in under five minutes."

Biases arise from multiple sources, some of which are not as documented in the literature. Biases are encoded in how the data has been collected and labeled, by implicit and unconscious biases of clinicians, or by the tools used for data processing. These biases and their encoding in healthcare records undermine the reliability of such data and bias clinical judgments and medical outcomes. Moreover, when healthcare records are used to build data-driven solutions, the biases are further exacerbated, resulting in systems that perpetuate biases and induce healthcare disparities. This literature scoping review aims to categorize the main sources of biases inherent in EHRs.Methods We queried PubMed and Web of Science on January 19th, 2023, for peer-reviewed sources in English, published between 2016 and 2023, using the PRISMA approach to stepwise scoping of the literature. To select the papers that empirically analyze bias in EHR, from the initial yield of 430 papers, 27 duplicates were removed, and 403 studies were screened for eligibility. 196 articles were removed after the title and abstract screening, and 96 articles were excluded after the full-text review resulting in a final selection of 116 articles.Results Systematic categorizations of diverse sources of bias are scarce in the literature, while the effects of separate studies are often convoluted and methodologically contestable. Our categorization of published empirical evidence identified the six main sources of bias: a) bias arising from past clinical trials; b) data-related biases arising from missing, incomplete information or poor labeling of data; human-related bias induced by c) implicit clinician bias, d) referral and admission bias; e) diagnosis or risk disparities bias and finally, (f) biases in machinery and algorithms.Conclusions Machine learning and data-driven solutions can potentially transform healthcare delivery, but not without limitations. The core inputs in the systems (data and human factors) currently contain several sources of bias that are poorly documented and analyzed for remedies. The current evidence heavily focuses on data-related biases, while other sources are less often analyzed or anecdotal. However, these different sources of biases add to one another exponentially. Therefore, to understand the issues holistically we need to explore these diverse sources of bias. While racial biases in EHR have been often documented, other sources of biases have been less frequently investigated and documented (e.g. gender-related biases, sexual orientation discrimination, socially induced biases, and implicit, often unconscious, human-related cognitive biases). Moreover, some existing studies lack causal evidence, illustrating the different prevalences of disease across groups, which does not per se prove the causality. Our review shows that data-, human- and machine biases are prevalent in healthcare and they significantly impact healthcare outcomes and judgments and exacerbate disparities and differential treatment. Understanding how diverse biases affect AI systems and recommendations is critical. We suggest that researchers and medical personnel should develop safeguards and adopt data-driven solutions with a “bias-in-mind” approach. More empirical evidence is needed to tease out the effects of different sources of bias on health outcomes.CCS Concepts • Computing methodologies → Machine learning; Machine learning approaches; • Applied computing → Health care information systems; Health informatics; • Social and professional topics → Personal health records; Medical records.ACM Reference Format Oriel Perets, Emanuela Stagno, Eyal Ben Yehuda, Megan McNichol, Leo Anthony Celi, Nadav Rappoport, and Matilda Dorotic. 2024.

Binomial likelihoods are computed for two models, each defined by pre-specified odds ratio (OR) thresholds. Model one represents the hypothesis of association between variant and phenotype (e.g. OR≥5) and model two represents the hypothesis of non-association (e.g. OR≤1).Results PS4-LRCalc enables continuous quantitation of evidence for variant classification expressed as a likelihood ratio (LR), which can be log-converted into log LR (evidence points). Using PS4-LRCalc, observed data can be used to quantify evidence towards either pathogenicity or benignity. Variants can also be evaluated against models of different penetrance. The approach is applicable to balanced datasets generated for more common phenotypes and smaller datasets more typical in very rare disease variant evaluation.Conclusion PS4-LRCalc enables flexible evidence quantitation on a continuous scale for observed case-control data. The converted LR is amenable to incorporation into the now widely used 2018 updated Bayesian ACMG/AMP framework."

In Argentina, an estimated two million individuals are afflicted with Chagas disease, with 600,000 exhibiting clinical manifestations. This study endeavors to gauge the populace’s knowledge levels in Añatuya, situated northeast of Santiago del Estero, and to compare comprehension levels between Chagas disease patients and non-patients. Employing a cross-sectional epidemiological design, demographic, socio-economic, and medical data were gathered through surveys from individuals aged 18 and above attending local healthcare facilities. Analysis revealed that among 200 patients, 12% exhibited low, 66% intermediate, and 22% high levels of elementary knowledge regarding Chagas disease, nearing optimal understanding for an endemic region. However, statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in knowledge were observed between Chagas and non-Chagas patients in only three out of ten elementary knowledge questions. Moreover, housing quality, a pivotal risk factor for Triatoma Infestans presence, indicated that 78% resided in improved dwellings, yet 22% lived in high-risk housing, reflecting persistent precarious living conditions susceptible to infestation. Enhanced comprehension of Chagas disease fundamentals and associated risk factors could empower endemic area residents towards proactive well-being practices, advocating for improved living standards and disease management strategies."

In chronic lung fibrotic disease like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), alveolar epithelial cells regenerate abnormally. The cause of this is unknown but its highly cellular, inflamed and structurally altered regenerating niche is likely to be relevant. Here, in unique sets of human lung tissues capturing advancing fibrosis, and with a 33-plex single cell imaging mass cytometry (IMC), we provide a high resolution and comprehensive temporo-spatial cell atlas of the regenerating alveolar niches. Using a suite of mathematical tools, we expose an organized immune network and identify CD206hi alveolar macrophages as a central immune cell in the immune-alveolar epithelial interactome. A spatially-directed receptor-ligand analysis offers an in-silico mechanism by which these macrophages influenced alveolar regeneration. Our study unravels a complex cellular environment and identifies key interactions that influence alveolar regeneration in a fibrotic lung."

While socioeconomic factors have been shown to contribute to hypertension risk in adults, similar data in children is lacking. We examined the association between socioeconomic characteristics of school neighborhoods and the prevalence of hypertension in adolescents.Methods School neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) was assessed via the area deprivation index (ADI), a composite measure of area-level socioeconomic deprivation. Using data from a school BP surveillance program implemented in the Houston metropolitan area, we performed a cross-sectional analysis using both univariate and multivariable regression analyses.Results Among 21,392 students aged 10 to 19 years during the 2000 through 2017 academic years, the prevalence of sustained hypertension was 2.6%. Although 85% of students attended schools located in neighborhoods in quartiles 1 (Q1) and 2 (Q2) (higher ADI represents more deprivation), Hispanics and African Americans were overrepresented in the schools located inside more deprived neighborhoods. The highest sustained hypertension rate (4.6%) was observed among students attending Q 3 and Q4 schools compared to 2.3% in Q 1 and Q2 schools (p < 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed that being male, obese, and attending school in a disadvantaged neighborhood were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of hypertension.Conclusions Attending school in neighborhoods with lower SES may account for the increased hypertension prevalence in minority adolescents. Characteristics of school neighborhoods play an important role in the disparities observed in hypertension prevalence, providing direct opportunities to encourage improved dietary intake and physical activity, both of which are important determinants of hypertension."

Difficulties in estimating the trends in disease incidence arise mainly from the time delay between case diagnosis and the reporting of cases to public health databases. However, predictive models usually assume that public data sets faithfully reflect the state of disease transmission. In this paper, we study the effect of delayed case reporting by comparing data reported by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (CRC) with that of the raw clinical data collected from the San Antonio Metro Health District (SAMHD), San Antonio, Texas. An insight on the subtle effect that such reporting errors potentially have on predictive modeling is presented. We use an exponential distribution model for the regression analysis of the reporting delay. The proposed model for correcting reporting delays was applied to our recently developed SEYAR (Susceptible, Exposed, Symptomatic, Asymptomatic, Recovered) dynamical model for COVID-19 transmission dynamics. Employing data from SAMHD, we demonstrate that the forecasting ability of the SEYAR model is substantially improved when the rectified reporting obtained from our proposed model is utilized. The methods and findings demonstrated in this work have ample applicability in the forecasting of infectious disease outbreaks. Our findings suggest that failure to consider reporting delays in surveillance data can significantly alter forecasts."

We assessed the association between current/active infection status and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, or S. mekongi with PPF.Methods We systematically searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Global Health, Global Index Medicus and Medline on August 24, 2022. A meta-analysis to derive pooled effect sizes for concurrently measured current schistosome infection status and intensity against author-defined PPF was conducted using inverse-variance weighted random effects. Subgroup analyses by study characteristics and risk of bias assessments using a modified National Institute of Health Risk of Bias Tool were completed. The protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022333919).Findings We identified 2646 records; 37 studies were included in the systematic review and 30 studies in the meta-analysis. S. mansoni was most studied (91·89%; 34/37). PPF was heterogeneously defined with the Niamey ultrasound protocol commonly used for diagnosis. Individuals with any current infection were 2·50 (95% CI:1·71-3·66) times more likely to have PPF compared to uninfected individuals with high heterogeneity (I2 statistic 94·80%). Subgroup analyses showed there was no association when only ultrasound patterns or modified Niamey Protocols were used. There was no association in studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa after 2002 when mass drug administration became widespread, or in studies with a low risk of bias. No significant association was found between schistosome infection intensity and PPF.Interpretation World Health Organization guidelines use current schistosome infection intensity as a proxy for schistosomiasis-related morbidity. This study supports that only current infection status was tenuously associated with PPF. Guidelines are needed to better monitor schistosomiasis-related morbidities.Funding NDPH Pump Priming Fund, Wellcome Trust-ISSF (204826/Z/16/Z), John Fell Fund, Robertson Foundation, and UKRI EPSRC (EP/X021793/1).Evidence before this study Periportal fibrosis (PPF) is a severe complication of intestinal schistosomiasis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Global Health, Global Index Medicus, and Medline from the database inception to August 24, 2022. The broad search terms were “Schistosoma”, “fibrosis” AND “periportal OR liver”. Three reviews were detected by the search string; these detailed how human genetics influence fibrosis outcomes, non-invasive methods of periportal fibrosis in schistosomiasis patients, and human host regulation of liver fibrosis during schistosome infection. Outside this search string, reviews exploring the impact of co-infections on liver morbidity (Hepatitis B/C and malaria), the use of ultrasonography for assessing morbidity, and the impact of chemotherapy on liver morbidity were identified or in progress. No review had assessed the impact of current intestinal schistosome infection status or intensity on PPF outcomes.Added value of this study Here we provide quantitative evidence for the influence of (or lack thereof) current Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, and S. mekongi infection status and intensity on PPF while presenting the risk of bias in the available literature. By synthesising data ranging from 1988–2020 encompassing 17317 participants, across all age ranges, we found that individuals with current schistosome infection were 2·50 times more likely to have PPF when compared to individuals who are not currently infected. Heterogeneity was high (>90%) across studies and was not reduced when moderate or high risk of bias studies were excluded. The association of current schistosome infection status was tenuous, determined solely by unadjusted studies that ignored cofounders and were conducted prior to mass drug administration. The association was observed only in moderate to high risk of bias studies and not present in low risk of bias studies. Importantly, we found no significant association between the intensity of current schistosome infections and PPF with very few studies available on current infection intensity.Implications of all the available evidence Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines focus on reducing schistosomiasis-related morbidity as approximated by community prevalence cut-offs set based on only current schistosome infection intensity. This meta-analysis provides evidence that those currently infected with schistosomes had an increased likelihood of having PPF, but only when infection status was considered rather than infection intensity. The high heterogeneity found among studies presented here suggests the need for standardisation of PPF diagnosis to accurately estimate the global burden of this disease in the future. Our findings suggest that in the current context of widespread, repeated mass drug administration infection proxy indicators are poor estimates of severe morbidity related to schistosomal liver fibrosis. Guidelines or recommendations are needed now from the WHO to assist endemic countries on how to directly monitor schistosomiasis-related morbidities as opposed to monitoring current infections while considering existing local resources and health system constraints."

In addition, two control datasets (N=56; N=18) of typically developing children were used as a reference.Interventions Not applicable.Main Outcome Measures Inter-trial and inter-session variability was measured using intra-class correlations (ICC’s) with accompanying confidence intervals, standard error of measurement (SEM), as well as the SEM expressed as percentage (%SEM) of the total joint-range-of-motion of typically developed children.Results Overall we found good to excellent ICC-values and favourable SEM-values for the inter-session Gait Profile Score (ICC=0.85-0.98, SEM=0.45°-0.91°) and Gait Variable Scores (ICC=0.85-0.99, SEM=0.22-1.11°) for the lower-limb joints. The %SEM was the highest for the ankle joint (%SEM=0.8%–3.0%). For the continuous waveform data, only in the ankle joint, differences were observed. Namely, smaller SEM-values for the AFO-condition (mean inter-trial=0.14°; mean inter-session=1.121°) in comparison to the barefoot-condition (mean inter-trial= 0.55°; mean inter-session=2.22°). For all the kinetic parameters, the treadmill conditions showed smaller SEM-values in comparison to the overground condition.Conclusions All conditions proved to be repeatable, showing good to excellent ICC-values. The ankle kinematics were more repeatable when the participants were walking with their AFOs in comparison to barefoot walking. Taking the total joint-range-of-motion into account, the knee joint showed the most repeatable motion, while ankle motions showed the lowest repeatability. For kinetics, treadmill conditions showed better repeatability than the overground conditions."

Such classifiers have previously demonstrated the ability to discern a range of protected demographic attributes (like race, age, sex) from medical images with unexpectedly high performance, a sensitive task which is difficult even for trained physicians. Focusing on the task of predicting sex from dermoscopic images of skin lesions, we are successfully able to train high-performing classifiers achieving a ROC-AUC score of ∼0.78. We highlight how incorrect use of these demographic shortcuts can have a detrimental effect on the performance of a clinically relevant downstream task like disease diagnosis under a domain shift. Further, we employ various explainable AI (XAI) techniques to identify specific signals which can be leveraged to predict sex. Finally, we introduce a technique to quantify how much a signal contributes to the classification performance. Using this technique and the signals identified, we are able to explain ∼44% of the total performance. This analysis not only underscores the importance of cautious AI application in healthcare but also opens avenues for improving the transparency and reliability of AI-driven diagnostic tools."

It affects around 1% of the UK population and, if not properly treated, can lead joint damage, disability, and significant socioeconomic burden. The risk of long-term damage is reduced if treatment is started in an early disease stage with treatment in the first 3 months being associated with significantly improved clinical outcomes. However, treatment is often delayed due to long referral waits and challenges in identifying early RA in primary care. We plan to use large primary care datasets to develop and validate an RA risk prediction model for use in primary care, with the aim to provide an additional mechanism for early diagnosis and referral for treatment.Methods We identified candidate predictors from literature review, expert clinical opinion, and patient research partner input. Using coded primary care data held in Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum, we will use a time to event Cox proportional hazards model to develop a 1-year risk prediction model for RA. This will be validated first in CPRD GOLD and then independently in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage dataset. We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis for the same model at 2–5-year risk, with a secondary outcome of RA and initiation of a disease modifying drug, and with the addition of laboratory test results as candidate predictors.Discussion The resulting risk prediction model may provide an additional mechanism to distinguish early RA in primary care and reduce treatment delays through earlier referral."

This study aimed to obtain insights into the relationships between circulating amino acids and MASLD.Methods Utilizing data from the UK Biobank, we examined the observational associations of ten amino acids with MASLD in a cohort of 72,626 MASLD cases and 128,102 controls. Bi-directional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted using genome-wide association study data to investigate the causal relationships between amino acids and MASLD. Multiple MR methods comprising MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO were applied to assess pleiotropy and heterogeneity, and multivariable MR was conducted to evaluate the impacts of body mass index (BMI) on these associations. Survival analysis assessed the link between baseline amino acid levels and the risk of major outcomes.Results We identified nine amino acids significantly associated with MASLD in the observational study. The genetic predisposition towards higher leucine (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 2.1 [1.4, 3.2]), valine (OR [95% CI]: 1.8 [1.3, 2.7]), and alanine (OR [95% CI]: 1.4 [1.1, 1.8]) levels were significantly associated with MASLD. By contrast, the genetic predisposition for increased MASLD risk was significantly associated with phenylalanine (beta = 0.05, p = 4.0×10-4). Further analysis showed that valine may mediate the association between BMI and MASLD, and may also have an exclusive effect on MASLD in addition to the effect of obesity (beta = 1.3, p = 1.9×10-4). Elevated phenylalanine levels in MASLD patients were linked with an increased risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis, heart failure, stroke, and mortality.Conclusion We found genetic associations between circulating branched-chain amino acids, particularly leucine and valine, and MASLD, independent of obesity. Phenylalanine was identified as a potential biomarker for MASLD prognostic complications. These results highlight the importance of amino acid metabolism in MASLD as well as suggest new possibilities for research and therapeutic intervention."

The goal of UCSF REACH is to define cLBP phenotypes and pain mechanisms that can lead to effective, personalized treatments for patients across the population. The primary objective of this research project is to address the critical need for new diagnostic and prognostic markers, and associated patient classification protocols for chronic low back pain (cLBP) treatment.Design To meet this objective, REACH is conducting two large investigator-initiated translational research cohort studies called: The Longitudinal Clinical Cohort for Comprehensive Deep Phenotyping of Chronic Low-Back Pain (cLBP) Adults Study (comeBACK) and the Chronic Low-Back Pain (cLBP) in Adults Study (BACKHOME).Setting comeBACK is a longitudinal multicenter in-person observational study of 450 adults with chronic low back pain designed to perform comprehensive deep phenotyping. While, the BACKHOME study is a site-less longitudinal observational e-cohort of approximately 3000 U.S. adults with cLBP. To our knowledge, BACKHOME is the largest prospective remote registry of nationwide adults with cLBP.Methods Both the comeBACK and BACKHOME studies are collecting a robust and comprehensive set of risk factors, outcomes, and covariates in order to perform deep phenotyping of cLBP patients based on combined biopsychosocial variables to: define cLBP subtypes, establish phenotyping tools for routine clinical evaluation, and lead to improved cLBP outcomes in the future. The data from both studies will be used to establish techniques to develop a patient-centric definition of treatment success and to analyze cLBP patient traits to define clinically useful cLBP phenotypes, using a combination of traditional data analyses and deep learning methods.Conclusions These 2 pivotal studies, in conjunction with the ancillary studies being performed in both comeBACK and BACKHOME, and the other BACPAC-consortium research projects, we will be able to address a number of diagnostic and therapeutic issues in this complex and diverse patient population with cLBP. These studies will help clarify biopsychosocial mechanisms of cLBP with the aim to provide a foundation to improve the evaluation of treatment effectiveness and to spur new avenues of therapeutic research, including personalized outcome measures that constitute a clinically meaningful treatment effect for individual cLBP patients."

The first cohort, used for cross-sectional analysis, was a matched sample of 122 participants with and without severe SDB. The second cohort, used for longitudinal analysis, consisted of a matched sample of 52 participants with and without incident SDB. The cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts were selected from the Sleep Heart Health Study participants. The third cohort comprised 19 healthy adults exposed to acute intermittent hypoxia and ambient air on two separate days. Electrocardiographic measures were calculated from one-lead electrocardiograms.Results Compared to those without SDB, participants with severe SDB had greater QTVI (-1.19 in participants with severe SDB vs. -1.43 in participants without SDB, P = 0.027), heart rate (68.34 vs. 64.92 beats/minute; P = 0.028), and hypoxemia burden during sleep as assessed by the total sleep time with oxygen saturation less than 90% (TST90; 11.39% vs. 1.32%, P < 0.001). TST90, but not the frequency of arousals, was a predictor of QTVI. QTVI during sleep was predictive of all-cause mortality. With incident SDB, mean QTVI increased from -1.23 to -0.86 over 5 years (P = 0.017). Finally, exposing healthy adults to acute intermittent hypoxia for four hours progressively increased QTVI (from -1.85 at baseline to -1.64 after four hours of intermittent hypoxia; P = 0.016).Conclusions Prevalent and incident SDB are associated with ventricular repolarization instability, which predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Intermittent hypoxemia destabilizes ventricular repolarization and may contribute to increased mortality in SDB."

Specifically, the use of substances such as cocaine and heroin are responsible for over 50,000 drug related deaths combined annually. We used a comparative meta-analysis procedure to contrast activation patterns associated with cocaine and heroin cue reactivity, which may reflect substance use risk for these substances. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for studies with within-subject whole brain analyses comparing drug to neutral cues for users of cocaine and heroin published between 1995 and 2022. A total of 18 studies were included, 9 in each subgroup. Voxel-based meta-analyses were performed using seed-based d mapping with permuted subject images (SDM-PSI) for subgroup mean analyses and a contrast meta-regression comparing the two substances. Mean analysis results indicated that users of heroin showed more widespread activation in the nucleus accumbens, right inferior and left middle temporal gyrus, the right thalamus, and the right cerebellum while cocaine use was associated with recruitment of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Direct comparison of cue reactivity studies in heroin relative to cocaine users revealed greater activation in dopaminergic targets for users of heroin compared to users of cocaine. Differential activation patterns between substances may underlie differences in the clinical characteristics observed across users of cocaine and heroin, including seeking mood numbing effects in users of heroin. More consistent research methodology is needed to provide adequate studies for stringent meta-analyses examining common and distinct neural activation patterns across substances and moderation by clinically relevant factors."

To link transmission of ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC) between two sources, single nucleotide resolution of E. coli strains as well as E. coli diversity within and between samples is required. However, the microbiological methods to best track these pathogens are unclear. Here we compared different steps in the microbiological workflow to determine the impact different pre-enrichment broths, pre-enrichment incubation times, selection in pre-enrichment, selective plating, and DNA extraction methods had on recovering ESBL-EC from human stool samples, with the aim to acquire high quality DNA for sequencing and genomic epidemiology. We demonstrate that using a 4-hour pre-enrichment in Buffered Peptone Water, plating on cefotaxime supplemented MacConkey agar and extracting DNA using Lucigen MasterPure DNA Purification kit improves the recovery of ESBL-EC from human stool and produced high-quality DNA for whole genome sequencing. We conclude that our optimised workflow can be applied for single nucleotide variant analysis of an ESBL-EC from stool."

To better quantify heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly superspreading, we performed a systematic review of transmission events with data on secondary attack rates or contact tracing of individual index cases published before September 2021, prior to emergence of variants of concern and widespread vaccination. We reviewed 592 distinct events and 9,883 index cases from 491 papers. Meta-analysis of secondary attack rates identified substantial heterogeneity across 12 chosen event types/settings, with the highest transmission (25–35%) in co-living situations including households, nursing homes, and other congregate housing. Among index cases, 67% produced zero secondary cases and only 3% (287) infected >5 secondary cases (“superspreaders”). Index case demographic data was limited, with only 55% of individuals reporting age, sex, symptoms, real-time PCR cycle threshold values, or total contacts. With the data available, we identified a higher percentage of superspreaders among symptomatic individuals, individuals aged 49–64 years, and individuals with over 100 total contacts. Addressing gaps in reporting on transmission events and contact tracing in the literature is needed to properly explain heterogeneity in transmission and facilitate control efforts for SARS-CoV-2 and other infections."

This study presents the largest GWAS for urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in SSA individuals, including 8,970 participants living in different African regions and an additional 9,705 non-resident individuals of African ancestry from the UK Biobank and African American cohorts.Methods Urine biomarkers and genotype data were obtained from two SSA cohorts (AWI-Gen and ARK), and two non-resident African-ancestry studies (UK Biobank and CKD-Gen Consortium). Association testing and meta-analyses were conducted, with subsequent fine-mapping, conditional analyses, and replication studies. Polygenic scores (PGS) were assessed for transferability across populations.Results Two genome-wide significant (P<5×10−8) UACR-associated loci were identified, one in the BMP6 region on chromosome 6, in the meta-analysis of resident African individuals, and another in the HBB region on chromosome 11 in the meta-analysis of non-resident SSA individuals, as well as the combined meta-analysis of all studies. Replication of previous significant results confirmed associations in known UACR-associated regions, including THB53, GATM, and ARL15. PGS estimated using previous studies from European ancestry, African ancestry, and multi-ancestry cohorts exhibited limited transferability of PGS across populations, with less than 1% of observed variance explained.Conclusion This study contributes novel insights into the genetic architecture of kidney disease in SSA populations, emphasizing the need for conducting genetic research in diverse cohorts. The identified loci provide a foundation for future investigations into the genetic susceptibility to chronic kidney disease in underrepresented African populations Additionally, there is a need to develop integrated scores using multi-omics data and risk factors specific to the African context to improve the accuracy of predicting disease outcomes."

Cohort 1 (C1) starts in 2016 and includes a 3-year follow-up until 2019. Cohort 2 (C2) starts in 2019 and ends in 2022. We provide descriptive statistics on financial hardship and uncertainty and apply parallel Latent Growth Modelling (LGM) on each cohort to explain variations in psychological distress (GHQ-36) based on baseline and follow-up financial trajectories. The sample is adjusted using cross-sectional weights and inverse probability weights for attrition.Results Financial hardship rates do not differ across cohorts but a marginal increase of 10 percent in financial uncertainty is observed in 2022 for C2. No significant difference in associations is observed across cohorts in the LGM with constant financial hardship increasing the GHQ-36 slope by 0.89 (95%CI=0.76;1.02) and 0.89 (95%CI=0.73;1.05) units in C1 and C2 and constant financial uncertainty increasing it respectively by 0.95 (95%CI=0.74;1.17) and 1.04 (95%CI=0.82;1.25). Baseline hardship and uncertainty increase the intercept by 2.39 (95%CI=2.11;2.67) and 1.74 (195%CI=1.38;2.10) in C1 and 2.97 (95%CI=2.65;3.29) and 2.12 (95%CI=1.75;2.49) in C2.Discussion The uncertainty caused by the 2022 cost-of-living crisis might have contributed to increase psychological distress within the UK population. Stronger detrimental effects might be expected if financial hardship were to increase."

Here, we present a comprehensive study of MHT use and brain characteristics in middle-to older aged females from the UK Biobank, assessing detailed MHT data, APOE ε4 genotype, and tissue-specific gray (GM) and white matter (WM) brain age gap (BAG), as well as hippocampal and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes.Methods A total of 19,846 females with magnetic resonance imaging data were included (current-users = 1,153, 60.1 ± 6.8 years; past-users = 6,681, 67.5 ± 6.2 years; never-users = 12,012, mean age 61.6 ± 7.1 years). For a sub-sample (n = 538), MHT prescription data was extracted from primary care records. Brain measures were derived from T1-, T2- and diffusion-weighted images. We fitted regression models to test for associations between the brain measures and MHT variables including user status, age at initiation, dosage and duration, formulation, route of administration, and type (i.e., bioidentical vs synthetic), as well as active ingredient (e.g., estradiol hemihydrate). We further tested for differences in brain measures among MHT users with and without a history of hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy and examined associations by APOE ε4 status.Results We found significantly higher GM and WM BAG (i.e., older brain age relative to chronological age) as well as smaller left and right hippocampus volumes in current MHT users, not past users, compared to never-users. Effects were modest, with the largest effect size indicating a group difference of 0.77 years (∼9 months) for GM BAG. Among MHT users, we found no significant associations between age at MHT initiation and brain measures. Longer duration of use and older age at last use post menopause was associated with higher GM and WM BAG, larger WMH volume, and smaller left and right hippocampal volumes. MHT users with a history of hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy showed lower GM BAG relative to MHT users without such history. Although we found smaller hippocampus volumes in carriers of two APOE ε4 alleles compared to non-carriers, we found no interactions with MHT variables. In the sub-sample with prescription data, we found no significant associations between detailed MHT variables and brain measures after adjusting for multiple comparisons.Discussion Our results indicate that population-level associations between MHT use, and female brain health might vary depending on duration of use and past surgical history. Future research is crucial to establish causality, dissect interactions between menopause-related neurological changes and MHT use, and determine individual-level implications to advance precision medicine in female health care."

Specifically, RDoC assumes the relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health to be 1) manifested across neural and genetic units of analysis, 2) environmentally situated, and 3) reliable. To test these assumptions, we applied machine learning and commonality analyses to the ABCD dataset (n=11,876). Mental health predicted cognitive abilities of unseen children at out-of-sample r=.39. At baseline, this cognitive-abilities-mental-health relationship was accounted for by neuroimaging (including 45 types of brain MRI; 71%), by polygenic scores (18%) and by socio-demographics, lifestyles and developments (70%). Moreover, the variance in the cognitive-abilities-mental-health that was captured by socio-demographics, lifestyles and developments was explained by neuroimaging (68%) and polygenic scores (28%). These patterns were similar across two years. Consistent with RDoC, the cognitive-abilities-mental-health relationship was 1) manifested in both neuroimaging and polygenic scores, 2) explained by socio-demographics, lifestyles and developments and 3) reliable across two years. This supports RDoC’s view of cognitive abilities as an integrative-functional domain for the aetiology of mental health."

These calculations are based on assumptions of carrier gas flow (eg:assume 150 ml) as practised with measured flow vaporizers[1,2]. Carrier gas flow in a variable bypass vaporizer is agent specific,dynamic,unknown and operator independent.Therefore assuming carrier gas flow in calculations related to variable bypass vaporisers is without rationale[3]. In spite of technological advance,the amount of vapour produced is calculated based on clinically impractical assumptions. A simple method and formula is suggested for the quick estimate of vapour output, carrier gas flow and determine the splitting ratio while operating a sevoflurane variable bypass vaporizer."

However, its value as a stand-alone therapeutic was unknown.Methods To assess the therapeutic efficacy of ChAd63-KH, we conducted a “window of opportunity” randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT03969134). We aimed to enrol 100 participants (male and female aged 12-50 years) with uncomplicated PKDL of ≥ six months duration. ChAd63-KH (7.5×1010 viral particles) or saline placebo was administered once intramuscularly. Primary outcomes were safety and efficacy. Safety was determined by adverse event monitoring. Efficacy was the proportion of participants at 90 days post-vaccination with ζ90% improvement in clinical disease. Participants failing to reach this clinical endpoint were offered a standard of care (AmBisome®). Secondary outcomes included changes in PKDL severity grade and measurements of vaccine-induced immune response.Findings Between 4th April 2020 and 17th June 2022, 86 participants (66 adolescents, 20 adults; 47% female, 53% male) were enrolled and randomised to receive ChAd63-KH or placebo. 75 participants (87%) completed the trial as per protocol. No severe or serious adverse events were observed. At day 90 post vaccination, 6/40 (15%) and 4/35 (11%) participants in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively showed ≥ 90% clinical improvement (RR 1.31 [95% CI, 0.40 to 4.28], p=0.742). There were also no significant differences in PKDL grade between study arms. Whole blood transcriptomic analysis identified transcriptional modules associated with interferon responses and monocyte and dendritic cell activation, confirming vaccine reactogenicity.Interpretation Single dose administration of ChAd63-KH vaccine had no therapeutic efficacy in this subset of Sudanese PKDL patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether this vaccine would have therapeutic benefit using alternate dosing regimens or in combination with standard chemotherapy or immune modulation, and whether it has efficacy as a prophylactic vaccine for cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis.Funding This study was funded by the Wellcome Trust.Evidence before this study A leishmaniasis vaccine candidate was developed employing chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) to deliver genes encoding two Leishmania antigens, KMP-11 and HASPB1. This vaccine (ChAd63-KH) was previously evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a Phase I healthy volunteer study and a Phase IIa study in Sudanese patients with post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). It was shown to be safe and immunogenic, warranting further clinical studies to evaluate efficacy as a stand-alone therapeutic in PKDL patients.Added value of this study This clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ChAd63-KH in PKDL patients with persistent disease (dermal lesions for ≥ 6 months). If successful, single dose vaccination would significantly improve treatment options currently available to patients. The safety of ChAd63-KH was confirmed, with no severe or serious adverse events observed in trial participants. Approximately 13% of participants had ζ90% improvement in their PKDL over the course of 90 days follow up post vaccination, but this did not differ between vaccine and placebo arms, indicating that this reflected spontaneous cure rather than vaccine efficacy. Immune monitoring using whole blood transcriptomics confirmed the previously reported ability of this vaccine to induce immune responses in humans.Implications of all the available evidence This study indicates that as a stand-alone treatment, single dose vaccination with ChAd63-KH was unable to overcome the immune dysfunction that maintains persistent PKDL. A similar “high bar” has also been encountered in therapeutic vaccine trials for other persistent diseases. Given previous success with other forms of immunochemotherapy in PKDL, future therapeutic vaccine studies in PKDL might also benefit from combining ChAd63-KH vaccination with additional chemotherapy or immune modulation. The prophylactic efficacy of this vaccine against different types of leishmaniasis also remains to be evaluated."

However, encouraging participation among under-screened women remains challenging. Portugal’s decentralized health regions provide an ideal case study due to a significant proportion of eligible women avoiding regular screening. Globally, self-sampling has emerged as a promising solution to enhance screening attendance. This study aims to assess self-sampling acceptance among under-screened women in central Portugal, contributing to the existing knowledge of self-sampling in CC screening.Methods 801 women aged 30-59, not participating in the Central Region’s CC Screening for 4 or more years, were randomly recruited. Women who accepted to participate in the study received cervicovaginal self-sampling kits at home. Women with a positive high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) test result were invited for gynaecological follow-up.Results Among the 687 eligible women, 307 (44.7%) accepted, and 198 (28.8%) provided specimens for hr-HPV testing. Out of twelve positive cases, eleven underwent gynaecological follow-up, identifying six cervical lesions.Conclusions The study highlights the potential of self-sampling and HPV testing to enhance CC screening in Portugal, with encouraging acceptance and effective detection of cervical lesions. These findings offer a promising solution for addressing under-screening among eligible women in the decentralized health regions of Portugal."

Here we isolate genetic effects that are shared across 11 major psychiatric disorders (p factor) to gain further insight into genetic specificity and comorbidity over and above that contributed by the p factor, unique to each psychiatric disorder. After adjusting for transdiagnostic genetic effects, we examined genetic correlations among psychiatric traits as well as relationships with other biobehavioural traits. The landscape of genetic associations between pairs of psychiatric disorders changed substantially, and their genetic correlations with biobehavioural traits showed greater specificity. Isolating transdiagnostic genetic effects across major psychiatric disorders provides a nuanced understanding of disorder-specific genetic architecture and genetic comorbidity, and may help guide diagnostic nomenclature and treatment research."

However, WMH volume alone does not fully account for the extent of cognitive deficits and the mechanisms linking WMH to these deficits remain unclear. We propose that lesion network mapping (LNM), enables to infer if brain networks are connected to lesions, and could be a promising technique for enhancing our understanding of the role of WMH in cognitive disorders. Our study employed this approach to test the following hypotheses: (1) LNM-informed markers surpass WMH volumes in predicting cognitive performance, and (2) WMH contributing to cognitive impairment map to specific brain networks.Methods & results We analyzed cross-sectional data of 3,485 patients from 10 memory clinic cohorts within the Meta VCI Map Consortium, using harmonized test results in 4 cognitive domains and WMH segmentations. WMH segmentations were registered to a standard space and mapped onto existing normative structural and functional brain connectome data. We employed LNM to quantify WMH connectivity across 480 atlas-based gray and white matter regions of interest (ROI), resulting in ROI-level structural and functional LNM scores. The capacity of total and regional WMH volumes and LNM scores in predicting cognitive function was compared using ridge regression models in a nested cross-validation. LNM scores predicted performance in three cognitive domains (attention and executive function, information processing speed, and verbal memory) significantly better than WMH volumes. LNM scores did not improve prediction for language functions. ROI-level analysis revealed that higher LNM scores, representing greater disruptive effects of WMH on regional connectivity, in gray and white matter regions of the dorsal and ventral attention networks were associated with lower cognitive performance.Conclusion Measures of WMH-related brain network connectivity significantly improve the prediction of current cognitive performance in memory clinic patients compared to WMH volume as a traditional imaging marker of cerebrovascular disease. This highlights the crucial role of network effects, particularly in attention-related brain regions, improving our understanding of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment. Moving forward, refining WMH information with connectivity data could contribute to patient-tailored therapeutic interventions and facilitate the identification of subgroups at risk of cognitive disorders."

Despite yearly clinical cases rapidly increasing from 77 to 8,131 in the last decade, surveillance data on its distribution and prevalence remains limited. We implemented a novel assay for C. auris detection on a nationwide scale prospectively from September 2023 to March 2024, analyzing a total of 13,842 samples from 190 wastewater treatment plants across 41 U.S. states. Assays were extensively validated through comparison to other known assays and internal controls. Of these 190 wastewater treatment plants, C. auris was detected in the wastewater solids of 65 of them (34.2%) with 1.45% of all samples having detectable levels of C. auris. Detections varied seasonally, with 2.00% of samples positive in autumn versus 1.01% in winter (p<0.0001). The frequency of detection in wastewater was significantly associated with states having older populations (p<0.001), sewersheds containing more hospitals (p<0.0001), and sewersheds containing more nursing homes (p<0.001). These associations are in agreement with known C. auris epidemiology. This nationwide study demonstrates the viability of wastewater surveillance for C. auris surveillance, and further highlights the value of wastewater surveillance when clinical testing is constrained."

We found an association of alcohol intake with the ERS in the meta-analysis with 0.09 units higher ERS per drink consumed per day (p < 0.0001). Cross-sectional analyses in FHS revealed that a one-unit increment of the ERS was associated with 1.93 mm Hg higher SBP (p = 4.64E-07), 0.68 mm Hg higher DBP (p = 0.006), and an odds ratio of 1.78 for HTN (p < 2E-16). Meta-analysis of the cross-sectional association of the ERS with BP traits in eight independent external cohorts (n = 11,544) showed similar relationships with blood pressure levels, i.e., a one-unit increase in ERS was associated with 0.74 (p = 0.002) and 0.50 (p = 0.0006) mm Hg higher SBP and DBP, but could not confirm the association with hypertension. Longitudinal analyses in FHS (n = 3,260) and five independent external cohorts (n = 4,021) showed that the baseline ERS was not associated with a change in blood pressure over time or with incident HTN.Conclusions Our findings provide proof-of-concept that utilizing an ERS is a useful approach to capture the recent health consequences of lifestyle behaviors such as alcohol consumption."

First, we compare the relationship between EA and 18 psychiatric diagnoses within sibship in Dutch national registry data (N=1.7 million), thereby controlling for unmeasured familial factors. Second, we apply two-sample Mendelian Randomization, which uses genetic variants related to EA or psychiatric diagnosis as instrumental variables, to test whether there is a causal relation in either direction. Our results suggest that lower levels of EA causally increase the risk of MDD, ADHD, alcohol dependence, GAD and PTSD diagnoses. We also find evidence of a causal effect of ADHD on EA. For schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, OCD, and bipolar disorder, results were inconsistent across the different approaches, highlighting the importance of using multiple research designs to understand complex relationships such as between EA and mental health."

The nnU-Net deep learning-based segmentation framework was trained using 5-fold cross-validation. To enhance classification, we applied logical rules based on PE volume and probability thresholds. External model evaluation was performed in 770 and 34 CTPAs from two independent datasets.Results A total of 1483 CTPA examinations were evaluated. In internal cross-validation and test set, the trained model correctly classified 123 of 128 examinations as positive for PE (sensitivity 96.1%; 95% C.I. 91-98%; P < .05) and 521 of 551 as negative (specificity 94.6%; 95% C.I. 92-96%; P < .05). In the first external test dataset, the trained model correctly classified 31 of 32 examinations as positive (sensitivity 96.9%; 95% C.I. 84-99%; P < .05) and 2 of 2 as negative (specificity 100%; 95% C.I. 34-100%; P < .05). In the second external test dataset, the trained model correctly classified 379 of 385 examinations as positive (sensitivity 98.4%; 95% C.I. 97-99%; P < .05) and 346 of 385 as negative (specificity 89.9%; 95% C.I. 86-93%; P < .05).Conclusion Our automatic pipeline achieved beyond state-of-the-art diagnostic performance of PE in CTPA using nnU-Net for segmentation and volume- and probability-based post-processing for classification.An nnU-Net segmentation framework was applied to patient-level classification in CTPA examinations.The proposed algorithm can enable prioritization of patients with PE for rapid review in emergency radiology.The proposed algorithm showed outstanding performance on both internal and two publicly available external testing datasets (AUC, 98.3%; n=1355)."

We also investigated whether individuals who reported using cannabis to alleviate stress and depressive symptoms experienced symptom relief across the prenatal period.Methods Pregnant individuals (n=436) with a history of lifetime cannabis use were recruited and identified either as prenatal cannabis users (PCU; continued cannabis use following knowledge of pregnancy in the first trimester) or non-prenatal cannabis users (NPCU; no cannabis use following knowledge of pregnancy in the first trimester). PCU individuals additionally reported on reasons for continued cannabis use during pregnancy. We employed longitudinal multivariate modeling to examine trajectories of depression (maternal self-report; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), stress (maternal self-report; Perceived Stress Scale), and cannabis use (maternal self-report and urinalysis) over time, stratified by motives for use during the perinatal period.Results Stress, depression, and cannabis use decreased from the first to the third trimester (slope B= -0.21, -0.35, and -0.31, respectively). While cannabis use and depression at the first trimester were correlated with one another, they did not affect the other’s rate of change. Cannabis use similarly did not affect the rate of change in stress. Finally, while individuals using cannabis to cope with mental health symptoms experienced a decrease in overall depression symptoms, this slope was roughly equivalent to individuals who were not using cannabis prenatally (slope B= - 0.43 and -0.51, respectively).Conclusion Our sample experienced a collective decrease in depression, stress, and cannabis use prenatally. This decline in cannabis use – even among those who reported using to cope with mental health conditions – was not attributable to the decrease in depressive symptoms. This study lends valuable insight into the reasons why individuals continue to use cannabis during pregnancy, which providers can use to help tailor recommendations for other sources of coping and support to childbearing individuals."

Despite recent advances, communication with brain-computer interfaces has been restricted by extensive training data requirements and inaccurate word output. A man in his 40’s with ALS with tetraparesis and severe dysarthria (ALSFRS-R = 23) was enrolled into the BrainGate2 clinical trial. He underwent surgical implantation of four microelectrode arrays into his left precentral gyrus, which recorded neural activity from 256 intracortical electrodes. We report a speech neuroprosthesis that decoded his neural activity as he attempted to speak in both prompted and unstructured conversational settings. Decoded words were displayed on a screen, then vocalized using text-to-speech software designed to sound like his pre-ALS voice. On the first day of system use, following 30 minutes of attempted speech training data, the neuroprosthesis achieved 99.6% accuracy with a 50-word vocabulary. On the second day, the size of the possible output vocabulary increased to 125,000 words, and, after 1.4 additional hours of training data, the neuroprosthesis achieved 90.2% accuracy. With further training data, the neuroprosthesis sustained 97.5% accuracy beyond eight months after surgical implantation. The participant has used the neuroprosthesis to communicate in self-paced conversations for over 248 hours. In an individual with ALS and severe dysarthria, an intracortical speech neuroprosthesis reached a level of performance suitable to restore naturalistic communication after a brief training period."

This retrospective cross-sectional study with a follow up aimed to investigate the adverse outcomes of antenatal dengue infection and identify predictive parameters associated with maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. A total of 115 pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed dengue infection admitted to two tertiary referral hospitals in Sri Lanka were followed from admission until delivery and discharge. Data on clinical and laboratory outcome variables were collected and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.Results revealed a seasonal pattern of dengue infections, with the majority occurring between April and July. Dengue fever (DF) accounted for the majority of cases, followed by dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue expanded syndrome (DES). Maternal adverse outcomes were observed in 27.8% of cases, with predictors including dengue category, trimester of infection, platelet count, and AST levels. Fetal adverse outcomes affected 8.1% of cases, while neonatal adverse outcomes occurred in 28.7% of live births, with transplacental transmission observed in 13.3% of cases.This study underscores the urgent need for early detection and management of antenatal dengue infection to mitigate adverse outcomes. Identifying predictors of adverse maternal outcomes, such as dengue category and trimester of infection, alongside vigilant monitoring of platelet and AST levels, is crucial for optimizing outcomes. Further research is warranted to develop robust prediction models and refine management strategies for this vulnerable population.Author summary This study is diving into how dengue fever affects pregnant women in and how to predict them. Dengue is a huge problem worldwide, with millions of cases each year. Dengue fever is caused by a virus spread by mosquitoes. Being pregnant makes dealing with dengue even harder. Pregnancy brings changes to a woman’s body, which can make it tough to spot and treat dengue. We followed up pregnant women with confirmed dengue infections from when they were admitted to the hospital until they had their babies. Our study looked at things like their symptoms, lab results, and any problems they had.Study found that more than a quarter of the women had serious problems because of dengue. Some even died, or had issues like liver problems or brain swelling. Study found some laboratory markers which could be used to predict these bad outcomes. It’s important for doctors to keep an eye on pregnant women with dengue and to act fast if things get serious."

While both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been linked to an elevated risk of OM, the precise causal relationships remain uncertain.Methods We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to explore the causal effects of T1DM, T2DM, their complications, and glycemic traits on OM risk. The study utilized the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, along with weighted median and MR-Egger for causal estimation, and performed various sensitivity analyses to ensure robustness. Multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis assessed direct effects, while two-step mediation MR analyses investigated the mediating role of DM between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and OM.Results The MR analysis unveiled distinct causal effects of T1DM and T2DM on OM risk. Genetically determined T2DM, rather than its complications, significantly increased OM risk (primary dataset: IVW: OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.056–1.209, p = 4E-04; validation dataset: IVW: OR = 1.317, 95% CI 1.14–1.522, p =2E-04; Meta-analysis: OR=1.206; 95% CI 1.037–1.402; p=0.014), with no observable heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy. MVMR analysis confirmed the robustness of the causal association between T2DM and OM, even after adjusting for potential confounders such as body mass index. Conversely, T1DM and its complications showed no significant causal link with OM in either the primary dataset (IVW: p = 0.071), the validation dataset (IVW: p = 0.276), or the meta-analysis (IVW: p = 0.242). Additionally, there was no robust evidence supporting the causal risk of glycemic traits on OM. Mediation MR analysis underscored T2DM as a pivotal contributor to the differential effects of RA on OM.Conclusions Mendelian randomization analysis provides compelling evidence of a significant causal relationship between genetically determined T2DM and increased OM risk, while T1DM exhibits distinct causal effects. Additionally, our findings highlight the role of T2DM in mediating the association between RA and OM. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and guide targeted interventions for OM prevention and management in diabetic populations."

These secondary effects, interconnected in networks of signs and symptoms, are usually overlooked by clinical trials, not reported in package inserts, and neglected in clinical practice.Objective This study explores the syndromic burden of impulsivity induced by pramipexole and aripiprazole, pinpointing key symptoms for targeted mitigation.Methods An event-event Information Component (IC) on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (January 2004 – March 2022) identified the syndrome of events disproportionally co-reported with impulsivity, separately for pramipexole and aripiprazole. A greedy-modularity clustering on composite network analyses (PPMI, Ising, Φ) identified subsyndromes. Bayesian network modeling highlighted possible precipitating events.Results Suspected drug-induced impulsivity was documented in 7.49% pramipexole and 4.50% aripiprazole recipients. The highest IC concerned obsessive-compulsive disorder (reporting rate = 26.77%; IC median = 3.47, 95%CI = 3.33-3.57) and emotional distress (21.35%; 3.42, 3.26-3.54) for pramipexole, bankruptcy (10.58%; 4.43, 4.26-4.55) and divorce (7.59%; 4.38, 4.19-4.53) for aripiprazole. The network analysis identified delusional jealousy and dopamine dysregulation subsyndromes for pramipexole, obesity-hypoventilation and social issues for aripiprazole. The Bayesian network highlighted anxiety and economic problems as potentially precipitating events.Conclusion The under-explored consequences of drug-induced impulsivity significantly burden patients and families. Network analyses, exploring syndromic reactions and potential precipitating events, complement traditional techniques and clinical judgment. Characterizing the secondary impact of reactions will support informed patient-centered decision-making.HighlightsDrug-induced impulsivity significantly impacts patients’ lives. Network analyses help characterize reactions as syndromes.We explore the impulsivity syndrome and subsyndromes resulting from pramipexole and aripiprazole.The manifestation of drug-induced impulsivity was different for the two drugs. Anxiety and economic problems bridge between other symptoms and could be important therapeutical targets."

We assessed the quality of hypertension care in Burkina Faso using the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Quality Domains of effectiveness, timeliness of access, patient-centredness and equitability of care.We performed an analysis of cross-sectional household survey data collected from a population-representative sample of 4000 adults ≥40 years in Nouna, Burkina Faso in 2018. For people with hypertension, effectiveness was assessed through the construction of care cascades describing the proportion who were screened, diagnosed, treated, and achieved hypertension control; timeliness was defined as access to care within the last 3 months. Patient-centredness was described using experiential quality process and outcome measures (dichotomised as higher [score above the median] or lower quality [score below and including the median]; a shared understanding and decision-making variable (SUDM) was also described. Equity was assessed for effectiveness, timeliness, and patient-centredness in multivariable analyses, including socio-demographic factors. In total, 1006 participants with hypertension were included. Hypertension prevalence was 34.8%, with 62.3% having previously been screened, 42.9% diagnosed, 15.0% treated, and 6.8% having controlled disease; 26.8% had accessed care within the last three months. Overall, 61.8% of participants had a positive view of the health service. Clarity of communication and opinion of medical provider knowledge were the best-rated experiential quality process variables, with 40.1% and 39.7% of participantś responses indicating higher quality care respectively. The mean SUDM score was 68.5 (±10.8) out of 100.0. Regarding equity, screening was higher in females, adults with any education, those who were married or cohabiting, and those in the higher wealth quintiles. There were no associations seen between SUDM and participant characteristics.Although prevalence of hypertension was high in this population, quality of care was not commensurate, with room for improvement in all four of the IOM Domains assessed."

AbstractBackground Previously, studies have indicated that high-density cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease. However, this has been challenged in recent years.Method This cross-sectional study was conducted on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2020. There were total of 15232 out of 45462 individuals who were age >40 years old, not missing HDL-C levels and not missing stroke data. The independent variable was HDL-Cholesterol. The outcome variable was stroke. We used multivariate logistic regression models to assess the relationship between stroke and HDL-C in three models consisting of the following explanatory variables: 1. HDL-C alone (unadjusted model), 2. HDL-C and non-modifiable risk factors (age, sex and race), 3. HDL-C, non-modifiable, and modifiable risk factors [hypertension, diabetes and smoking status] risk factors. We also conducted analyses stratified by sex and race.Results HDL-C categories 40-59 mg/dl (unadjusted model- 0.759, CI: 0.639, 0.901; non-modifiable risk factors adjusted- 0.668, CI: 0.558, 0.798) and 60-79 mg/dl (unadjusted model- 0.733, CI: 0.598, 0.898; non-modifiable risk factors adjusted- 0.565, CI: 0.455, 0.701) had significantly lower risk of stroke relative to HDL-C category <40 mg/dl. But when adjusted for modifiable risk factors, risk of stroke HDL-C categories 40-59 mg/dl and 60-79 mg/dl categories were not significantly different from the HDL-C <40 mg/dl category. The risk of stroke HDL-C categories 80-89 mg/dl and >90 mg/dl categories were not significantly different from the HDL-C <40 mg/dl category in all models. In stratified analyses, HDL-C was significantly inversely associated with the risk of stroke in male gender and in non-Hispanic White race.Conclusion Our study reveals various inverse relationship between HDL-C and risk of stroke. These findings suggest that relevant levels of HDL-C may be beneficial in preventing stroke in the absence of modifiable risk-factors."

This rapid review aims to determine the costs and cost-effectiveness of different service models of palliative care or end of life care. These studies are mostly conducted from the perspective of the healthcare system, disregarding costs related to patients/caregivers economic burden (Perea-Bello et al., 2023).Research Implications and Evidence Gaps More UK research is needed on cost impacts of new services such as Enhanced Supported Care (ESC). Future research should consider which methods are most appropriate to evaluate palliative care models. Standard methodology, such as the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), may not be most appropriate for this end of life population.Improving QALYs may not be the intended aim of palliative care or end of life interventions, and prolonging death may be inconsistent with patient preferences and wishes. The quality and applicability of the evidence we found in our rapid review were variable, and therefore, uncertainty remains, especially when the perspective of analysis was not stated clearly.Therefore, it was difficult to ascertain whether all relevant costs were considered. Assumptions on costs were not varied in many studies, and most studies had different time horizons.Policy and Practice Implications This rapid review has shown that hospital-based palliative care costs are higher than hospice or home-based palliative care. This suggests that home-based palliative care should be available to all patients in a recognisable end of life phase who desire to remain and die at home. Healthcare planners should aim to reduce hospitalisation at the end of life but only if access to quality home care at the end of life is guaranteed. Patients should have a choice about where they prefer to die without moving the costs from the healthcare system to the home caregivers, rendering the costs invisible.Funding Statement The Bangor Institute for Medical and Health Research, was funded for this work by the Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre, itself funded by Health and Care Research Wales on behalf of Welsh Government."

The biological mechanisms that underly post-stroke fatigue are currently unclear, however, reactivation of latent viruses and their impact on systemic immune function have been increasingly reported in other conditions where fatigue is a predominant symptom. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in particular has been associated with fatigue, including in long-COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, but has not yet been explored within the context of stroke.AIMS We performed an exploratory analysis to determine if there is evidence of a relationship between EBV reactivation and post-stroke fatigue.METHODS In a chronic ischemic stroke cohort (>6 months post-stroke), we assayed circulating EBV by qPCR and measured the titres of anti-EBV antibodies by ELISA in patients with high fatigue (FACIT-F <40) and low fatigue (FACIT-F >41). Statistical analysis between two-groups were performed by t-test when normally distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk test, by Mann-Whitney test when the data was not normally distributed, and by Fisher’s exact test for categorical data.RESULTS We observed a similar incidence of viral reactivation between people with low versus high levels of post-stroke fatigue (5 of 22 participants (24%) versus 6 of 22 participants (27%)). Although the amount of circulating EBV was similar between the groups, we observed an altered antibody response against EBV antigens in participants with high fatigue, with reduced IgM against the Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA; 2.244 ± 0.926 vs 3.334 ± 2.68; P = 0.031). Total IgM levels were not different between groups indicating this effect was specific to EBV (3.23 × 105 ± 4.44 × 104 high fatigue versus 4.60 × 105 ± 9.28 × 104 low fatigue; P= 0.288).CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that EBV is not more prone to reactivation during chronic stroke recovery in those with post-stroke fatigue. However, the dysregulated antibody response to EBV may be suggestive of viral reactivation at an earlier stage after stroke and warrants further investigation."

When vaccines provide waning immunity, efficient and timely uptake of boosters is required to maintain protection and flatten the curve of infections. How then do social dynamics affect the timely up-take of vaccines and thereby the course of an epidemic? To explore this scenario, a behavioural-epidemiological is developed here. It features a tipping-point dynamic for the uptake of vaccines that combines the risk of infection, perceived morbidity risk of the vaccine, and social payoffs for deviating from the vaccination decision making of others. The social payoffs are derived from a social norm of conformity, and they create a collective action problem. A key finding driven by this dilemma is that waves of vaccine uptake and infections can occur due to inefficient and delayed uptake of boosters. This results in a nonlinear response of the infection load to the transmission rate: an intermediate transmission rate can result in greater prevalence of disease relative to more or less transmissible diseases. Further, global information about the prevalence of the disease and vaccine uptake increases the infection load and peak relative to information restricted to individuals’ contact net-works. Thus, decisions driven by local information can mitigate the collective action problem across the population. Finally, the optimal public policy program to promote boosters is shown to be one that focuses on overcoming the social inertia to vaccinate at the start of an epidemic."

To further discern this association, here we aimed to better characterize the pulmonary bacterial communities in these patients by leveraging metagenomics and to evaluate if the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) could explain the higher mortality of the patients.Material and methods Metagenomic sequencing was performed using the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit and HiSeq 4000 (Illumina Inc.) on tracheal aspirate samples that were obtained within 24 h from diagnosis from patients with extrapulmonary sepsis admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Analysis involved MetaSpades for contig assembly, Kraken2 and Metaphlan4 for taxonomic classification, and CARD and GTDB-tk for ARGs annotation and assignment to the bacterial species. The relationship between the presence of antibiotic resistance and ICU mortality was evaluated using the Wilcoxon test and logistic regression models adjusting for clinical and demographic variables.Results In total, 127 different ARGs were detected circumscribed only to seven patients. The most common ARGs found were from the antibiotic groups of aminoglycosides and beta-lactams, both present in most of the patients. These ARGs were found, almost entirely linked to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results also show a significant enrichment of ARGs among patients who died while admitted in the ICU (57%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 18-90%) compared to surviving patients (20%, 95% CI: 7-40%) (p=0.022). Analyses adjusting for clinical and demographic variables did not alter this result.Conclusion Metagenomic sequencing has allowed an unprecedented characterization of the sepsis lung microbiome showing that antibiotic resistance is common among these patients. The results also suggest a relationship between the early accumulation of ARGs in the lung of patients with extrapulmonary sepsis who die while admitted in the ICU. Studies in independent samples will be needed to validate our findings."

Few studies describe their immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. Yet, this characterization is crucial to re-enforce vaccination strategies adapted to Pacific Islanders singularities.Methods We evaluated the humoral immune response of 585 adults self-declaring as Melanesians, Europeans, Polynesians or belonging to other communities to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. Anti-Spike and anti-Nucleoprotein IgG levels, capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants and capacity to mediate Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) were assessed across communities at one and three months post-second dose or one and six months post-third dose.Results 61.3% of the sera tested contained anti-Nucleoprotein antibodies, evidencing mostly a hybrid immunity resulting from vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-Spike IgG levels and capacity to mediate Omicron neutralization and ADCC were equivalent across the four ethnic communities at one-month post-immunization, during follow-up and at six months post-third dose, regardless of the infection status. Obese individuals (BMI>30 kg/m²) had significantly higher anti-Spike IgG levels at one-month post-immunization (+0.26 (0.04; 0.48) AU in LuLISA assay, p value = 0.017). Odds of Omicron neutralization at six months after the third dose decreased significantly in the 40-64 years and ≥65 years groups (OR (95% CI) 0.48 (0.24-0.90) and 0.29 (0.14-0.58) respectively, p-value = 0.003).Conclusions Our study evidenced Pacific Islander’s robust humoral immune response to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine, which is pivotal to re-enforce vaccination deployment in a population at risk for severe COVID-19 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05135585).summary Ethnicity has little impact on Pacific Islanders’ hybrid humoral immune response to BNT162b2 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-Spike IgG levels, capacity to neutralize Omicron variants and capacity to mediate Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity are equivalent across Pacific communities following BNT162b2 vaccination."

Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) is a standard tool for assessing disease activity in UC but its relevance in PSC-UC remains unclear. Here, we sought to compare MES in a cohort of UC and PSC-UC patients and assess the accuracy using histological activity scoring (Nancy histological index; NHI).Methods MES was assessed in 30 PSC-UC and 29 UC adult patients during endoscopy. NHI and inflammation were evaluated in biopsies from the caecum, rectum, and terminal ileum. In addition, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, fecal calprotectin, body mass index, and other relevant clinical characteristics were collected.Results The median MES and NHI were similar for UC patients (MES grade 2 and NHI grade 2 in the rectum), but were different for PSC-UC patients (MES grade 0 and NHI grade 2 in the caecum). There was a correlation between MES and NHI for UC patients (Spearman’s ρ = 0.40, p = 0.029), but not for PSC-UC patients. Histopathological examination revealed persistent microscopic inflammation in 88% of PSC-UC patients with MES grade 0 (46% of all PSC-UC patients). Moreover, MES overestimated the severity of active inflammation in another 11% of PSC-UC patients.Conclusion MES fails to identify microscopic signs of inflammation in the context of PSC-UC. This indicates that histological evaluation should become an integral part of the diagnostic and grading system in both PSC-UC and PSC."

We examined the impact of an urban WASH in schools programme (Project WISE) on child health and attendance.Methods The WISE cluster-randomised trial, conducted in 60 public primary schools in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia over one academic year, enrolled 2–4 randomly selected classes per school (approximately 100 pupils) from grades 2–8 (aged 7–16) in an ’open cohort’. Schools were assigned 1:1 by stratified randomisation to receive the intervention during the 2021/22 academic year or the 2022/23 academic year (waitlist control). Masking was not possible. The intervention included improvements to drinking water storage, filtration and access, alongside handwashing stations and behaviour change promotion. Planned improvements to sanitation facilities were not realised. At four unannounced classroom visits between March and June 2022 (post-intervention, approximately every four weeks), enumerators recorded primary outcomes of roll-call absence, and pupil-reported respiratory illness and diarrhoea in the past seven days among pupils present. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT05024890.Findings Of 83 eligible schools, 60 were randomly selected and assigned. In total, 6229 eligible pupils were enrolled (median per school 101·5; IQR 94–112), with 5987 enrolled at study initiation (23rd November–22nd December 2021) and the remaining 242 during follow-up. Data were available on roll-call absence for 6166 pupils (99·0%), and on pupil-reported illness for 6145 pupils (98·6%). We observed a 16% relative reduction in the odds of pupil-reported respiratory illness in the past seven days during follow-up in intervention schools vs. control schools (aOR 0·84; 95% CI 0·71– 1·00; p=0·046). No effect was observed on pupil-reported diarrhoea in the past seven days (aOR 1·15; 95% CI 0·84–1·59; p=0·39) nor roll-call absence (aOR 1·07; 95% 0·83–1·38; p=0·59). There was a small increase in menstrual care self-efficacy (aMD 3·32 on 0–100 scale; 95% CI 0·05–6·59), and no effects on the other health, wellbeing and absence secondary outcomes.Interpretation This large-scale intervention to improve WASH conditions in schools across a large city had a borderline impact on respiratory illness among schoolchildren but no effect on diarrhoeal disease nor pupil absence. Future research should establish the relationships between WASH-related illness and absence and other downstream educational outcomes.Funding Children’s Investment Fund Foundation.Evidence before this study Prior to this study, there were several systematic reviews on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in schools, none of which used meta-analysis methods due to heterogeneity in intervention components and outcome measures. In the most comprehensive review in 2019, McMichael reported mixed evidence for the effectiveness of WASH in schools in low-income countries across health and educational outcomes, and randomised and non-randomised studies. Prior to starting this trial, there were two randomised trials conducted exclusively in urban schools in a low- or middle-income country: a handwashing trial in Cairo, Egypt examining absence due to influenza, and a trial of hand sanitizer and respiratory hygiene in Dhaka, Bangladesh for reducing influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed influenza. During this study, another randomised trial in Manila, Philippines was published, with different outcomes (malnutrition and dehydration). The effectiveness of combined water, sanitation and hygiene in urban schools on respiratory illness, diarrhoea and overall absence was not known, and some previous evaluations have used school records alone to track attendance. Previous studies evaluating WASH in schools interventions have suggested that multi-component interventions may be more effective, and that specific effects on girls’ absence might be observed with provision of a safe, private space to change menstrual materials.Added value of this study This study provides rigorous experimental evidence on the effectiveness of an urban school-based water and hygiene intervention in reducing pupil-reported respiratory illness among schoolchildren, during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no evidence of effects on pupil-reported diarrhoea or absence, nor gender-specific effects on absence. We highlight the value of unannounced visits for absence tracking with comparison to pupil-reported absence, and the need to distinguish seasonal and pandemic illness in future trials.Implications of all the available evidence Our results are consistent with the mixed impacts on health and absence found in previous WASH in schools evaluations. The lack of detected effects on diarrhoea, attendance and secondary outcomes related to wellbeing and menstrual health should be considered in light of the absence of sanitation infrastructure improvements, which were not delivered until after trial completion, which may have influenced risk of diarrhoeal disease. Nonetheless, school absence is multi-factorial, and these findings temper expectations that absence can be impacted by reductions in one domain of illness and not the many other important drivers linked to poverty and gender, and few programmes are likely to be able to obtain a more ambitious infrastructure and behaviour change programme at the scale of the one included in this trial, which is currently being replicated in other cities across Ethiopia."

However, accurate estimations of these phenomena in the real-world setting are lacking. This study aims at summarizing current evidence on RAW and PIRA, including associated factors, through a quantitative synthesis of real-world studies.Methods Scientific databases were searched to identify real-world studies published until December 31, 2023, reporting how many patients experienced RAW and PIRA (events of interest). Random-effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses and meta-regression models were ran to provide pooled estimates of RAW and PIRA events, and to identify their potential moderators (PROSPERO registration: CRD42024503895).Results Eighteen articles met the eligibility criteria, with a pooled sample size of 52,667 patients followed for 2.4 to 12.1 years (415,825 patient-years). Pooled event rates for RAW and PIRA were 1.6 and 3.1 per 100 patient-years, respectively. Less RAW events were found in patient cohorts under high-efficacy disease-modifying treatments (β=–0.031, p=0.007), while PIRA events were directly related to older age (β=0.397, p=0.027), predicting ≥6 PIRA events per 100 patient-years at an age ≥54 years. Additionally, we found significant differences in PIRA event rates according to the criteria adopted to define CDA.Discussion PIRA accounts for most CDA events in the real-world setting, even at the earlier disease stages, whereas RAW represents a less frequent phenomenon, likely due to effective treatments. However, the detection and statistical analysis of PIRA outcomes pose challenges, raising the risk of biased interpretation.What is already known on this topic Irreversible accumulation of disability in multiple sclerosis stems from two distinct yet not mutually exclusive phenomena: relapse-associated worsening (RAW) and progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA).What this study adds In this meta-analysis including data of 52,667 patients followed for 2.4 to 12.1 years, the pooled event rates were 1.6 and 3.1 per 100 patient-years for RAW and PIRA, respectively. High-efficacy treatment strongly suppresses RAW but not PIRA, which is instead associated with age and definition criteria.How this study might affect research, practice or policy Although PIRA accounts for most disability events in MS, its detection in real-world setting is necessarily inaccurate and its statistical analysis is challenging."

It leads to functional decline, disease and ultimately death, but the relationship between these fundamental biomedical features remains elusive. By applying machine learning to plasma proteome data of over fifty thousand human subjects in the UK Biobank and other cohorts, we report organ-specific and conventional aging models trained on chronological age, mortality and longitudinal proteome data. We show how these tools predict organ/systems-specific disease through numerous phenotypes. We find that men are biologically older and age faster than women, that accelerated aging of organs leads to diseases in these organs, and that specific diets, lifestyles, professions and medications are associated with accelerated and decelerated aging of specific organs and systems. Altogether, our analyses reveal that age-related chronic diseases epitomize accelerated organ- and system-specific aging, modifiable through environmental factors, advocating for both universal whole-organism and personalized organ/system-specific anti-aging interventions."

Typical neonatal brain imaging findings in PDCD have been described, with a focus on malformative features and chronic encephaloclastic changes. However, fetal brain MRI imaging in confirmed PDCD has not been comprehensively described. We sought to demonstrate the prenatal neurological and systemic manifestations of PDCD determined by comprehensive fetal imaging and genomic sequencing.All fetuses with a diagnosis of genetic PDCD who had undergone fetal MRI were included in the study. Medical records, imaging data, and genetic testing results were reviewed and reported descriptively.Ten patients with diagnosis of PDCD were included. Most patients had corpus callosum dysgenesis, abnormal gyration pattern, reduced brain volumes, and periventricular cystic lesions. One patient had associated intraventricular hemorrhages. One patient had a midbrain malformation with aqueductal stenosis and severe hydrocephalus. Fetuses imaged in the second trimester were found to have enlargement of the ganglionic eminences with cystic cavitations, while those imaged in the third trimester had germinolytic cysts.Fetuses with PDCD have similar brain MRI findings to neonates described in the literature, although some of these findings may be subtle early in pregnancy. Additional features, such as cystic cavitations of the ganglionic eminences, are noted in the second trimester in fetuses with PDCD, and these may represent a novel early diagnostic marker for PDCD. Using fetal MRI to identify these radiological hallmarks to inform prenatal diagnosis of PDCD may guide genetic counseling, pregnancy decision-making, and neonatal care planning."

Parsing its computational basis promises to explain its transdiagnostic character. We argue that one manifestation of anhedonia— reward insensitivity—may be linked to limited memory capacity. Further, the need to economize on limited capacity engenders a perseverative bias towards frequently chosen actions. Anhedonia may also be linked with deviations from optimal perseveration for a given memory capacity, a pattern that causes inefficiency because it results in less reward for the same memory cost. To test these hypotheses, we perform secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial testing κ-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonism for anhedonia, as well as analyses of three other datasets. We find that anhedonia is associated with deficits in efficiency but not memory, whereas KOR antagonism (which likely elevates tonic dopamine) increases memory and efficiency. KOR antagonism therefore has distinct cognitive effects, only one related to anhedonia."

We analyzed effects of covariate stratification and interaction on body mass index (BMI) PGS (PGSBMI) across four cohorts of European (N=491,111) and African (N=21,612) ancestry. Stratifying on binary covariates and quintiles for continuous covariates, 18/62 covariates had significant and replicable R2 differences among strata. Covariates with the largest differences included age, sex, blood lipids, physical activity, and alcohol consumption, with R2 being nearly double between best and worst performing quintiles for certain covariates. 28 covariates had significant PGSBMI-covariate interaction effects, modifying PGSBMI effects by nearly 20% per standard deviation change. We observed overlap between covariates that had significant R2 differences among strata and interaction effects – across all covariates, their main effects on BMI were correlated with their maximum R2 differences and interaction effects (0.56 and 0.58, respectively), suggesting high-PGSBMI individuals have highest R2 and increase in PGS effect. Using quantile regression, we show the effect of PGSBMI increases as BMI itself increases, and that these differences in effects are directly related to differences in R2 when stratifying by different covariates. Given significant and replicable evidence for context-specific PGSBMI performance and effects, we investigated ways to increase model performance taking into account non-linear effects. Machine learning models (neural networks) increased relative model R2 (mean 23%) across datasets. Finally, creating PGSBMI directly from GxAge GWAS effects increased relative R2 by 7.8%. These results demonstrate that certain covariates, especially those most associated with BMI, significantly affect both PGSBMI performance and effects across diverse cohorts and ancestries, and we provide avenues to improve model performance that consider these effects."

It investigates how independent (IndSC) and interdependent (InterSC) self-construals influence cognitive biases towards positive and negative stimuli, emphasizing the mediating roles of attentional control, self-esteem, cognitive reappraisal, and the need to belong. The research utilizes a hybrid sampling strategy, engaging 748 undergraduate students from diverse majors and universities in Chongqing, China. Participants completed assessments measuring self-construal, attentional control, self-esteem, cognitive reappraisal, need to belong, and cognitive biases. Employing structural equation modeling, the study uncovers that IndSC is positively associated with cognitive biases, favoring positive over negative information, with attentional control and self-esteem serving as significant mediators. InterSC, however, promotes a balanced attention to both positive and negative information, with cognitive reappraisal and the need to belong acting as mediators. These findings underscore the significant role of self-construal within the broader biopsychosocial framework in shaping cognitive processes and highlight the importance of considering these factors in mental health interventions. By leveraging a comprehensive sampling approach, the study ensures a representative sample, enhancing the generalizability of its findings to the broader Chinese college student population. This research not only contributes to the understanding of the complex interplay between cultural psychology and mental health but also suggests the need for mental health interventions that are culturally and individually tailored. Future research should extend to other cultural settings and employ longitudinal designs to further explore the dynamic interactions between self-construal, cognitive biases, and mental health from a biopsychosocial perspective."

CST shifts can occur in less than a day, but there is a lack of follow-ups lasting more than a few months; a gap in the knowledge that hampers our understanding of long-term dynamics. Analysing a longitudinal cohort of 125 women followed for a median duration of 10 months, we show that ‘optimal’ (CST I, II, and V) or ‘sub-optimal’ CST III are more stable in time than the ‘non-optimal’ CST IV. We also find that some probabilities of shifting from one CST to another are associated with covariates such reported number of sexual partners or alcohol consumption. Finally, we simulate population-level consequences of variations in behaviours. In addition to providing one of the first insights on vaginal microbiota dynamics over a year, along with a robust methodological analysis, these results open new perspectives to improve our mechanistic understanding of microbial interactions in the vaginal environment and develop new therapeutic strategies."

At present, the ACPE monitors programs with a passage rate of ≥2 standard deviations (SD) below the national mean pass rate. In 2023, this would lead to monitoring seven programs that produced 140 failures out of the total of 2,472 failures (i.e., 5.7%). In our view, this is neither equitable nor demonstrative of sufficient accountability. Analysis of failure counts among the 144 programs reported by NABP demonstrates a distribution curve highly skewed to the right. After evaluating average failure counts across all the programs, we suggest that schools with absolute failures ≥2 SD higher than the average number of failures of all programs should be flagged for monitoring. Based on the 2023 data, this corresponds to ≥35 failures/program. This threshold would flag 18 programs and 36.5% of the total failures. Of the seven programs that will be monitored based on the current Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education criteria, only one would be captured by the ≥35 failure method of selection with the remaining six contributing only 85 total failures to the pool. Thus, if both criteria were to be applied, i.e., ≥35 failures and of ≥2 standard deviations below the national mean pass rate, a total of 24 programs would be monitored (16.6% of the 144 programs), that contribute 987 (39.9%) of the total failures."

However, the inherent noise and limited resolution in ECG recordings can hinder accurate interpretation and diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel model for ECG super resolution (SR) that uses a DNAE to enhance temporal and frequency information inside ECG signals. Our approach addresses the limitations of traditional ECG signal processing techniques. Our model takes in input 5-second length ECG windows sampled at 50 Hz (very low resolution) and it is able to reconstruct a denoised super-resolution signal with an x10 upsampling rate (sampled at 500 Hz). We trained the proposed DCAE-SR on public available myocardial infraction ECG signals. Our method demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing high-resolution ECG signals from very low-resolution signals with a sampling rate of 50 Hz. We compared our results with the current deep-learning literature approaches for ECG super-resolution and some non-deep learning reproducible methods that can perform both super-resolution and de-noising. We obtained current state-of-the-art performances in super-resolution of very low resolution ECG signals frequently corrupted by ECG artifacts. We were able to obtain a signal-to-noise ratio of 12.20 dB (outperforms previous 4.68 dB), mean squared error of 0.0044 (outperforms previous 0.0154) and root mean squared error of 4.86% (outperforms previous 12.40%). In conclusion, our DCAE-SR model offers a robust (to artefact presence), versatile and explainable solution to enhance the quality of ECG signals. This advancement holds promise in advancing the field of cardiovascular diagnostics, paving the way for improved patient care and high-quality clinical decisions."

Early identification of those in whom disease is likely to progress enables timely therapeutic interventions to delay advancement to kidney failure. This study developed explainable machine learning models leveraging pathology data to accurately predict CKD trajectory, targeting improved prognostic capability even in early stages using limited datasets. Key variables used in this study include age, gender, most recent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), mean eGFR, and eGFR slope over time prior to incidence of kidney failure. Supervised classification modelling techniques included decision tree and random forest algorithms selected for interpretability. Internal validation on an Australian tertiary centre cohort (n=706; 353 with kidney failure and 353 without) achieved exceptional predictive accuracy, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) reaching 0.94 and 0.98 on the binary task of predicting kidney failure for decision tree and random forest, respectively. To address the inherent class imbalance, centroid-cluster-based under-sampling was applied to the Australian dataset. To externally validate the performance of the model, we applied the model to a dataset (n=597 adults) sourced from a Japanese CKD registry. To overcome risks of overfitting on small sample sizes, transfer learning was subsequently employed by fine-tuned machine learning models on 15% of the external dataset (n=89) before evaluating the remaining 508 patients. This external validation demonstrated performant results with an ROC-AUC of 0.88 for the decision tree and 0.93 for the random forest model. Decision tree model analysis revealed the most recent eGFR and eGFR slope as the most informative variables for prediction in the Japanese cohort, aligning with the underlying pathophysiology. The research highlights the utility of deploying explainable machine learning techniques to forecast CKD trajectory even in the early stages utilising limited real-world datasets."

Abortion beliefs and attitudes are considered to be partly rooted in traditional views on gender and religious influences. This study is informed by the limited data on gender norm perception and its association with abortion among VYAs despite the increasing prevalence of unsafe abortion reported among this group.Materials Data for this study was collected as part of a longitudinal survey on the gendered socialization and sexual and reproductive health of very young, in-school adolescents aged 10-14 years in Kenya and Nigeria. The study obtained quantitative data from 1,912 VYAs using a structured questionnaire. The results presented in this paper are from the quantitative baseline data collected in Kenya and NigeriaResult The study found significant regional differentials in attitudes toward abortion and gender norm perception of the VYAs from the two regions. VYAs from Nigeria were more likely to endorse abortion practices relative to their counterparts from Kenya. Factors associated with endorsement of abortion practice were gender norms about Sexual Double Standards (SDS) and Normative Heterosexual Relation (NHR) in Nigeria and knowledge of where to get a condom, NHR, and Normative Romantic Relationship (NRR) in Kenya.Conclusion Intervention efforts seeking to promote positive gender norms and attitudes towards SRH must begin with the VYAs and must consider regional variations and address knowledge and access to SRH commodities.What is already known on this topic previous studies have explored attitudes towards gender norms and abortion among young people and adults, with little known among very young adolescents aged 10-14 years.What this study adds the study contributed to the limited research on gender norms and attitudes towards abortion among very young adolescents.How this study might affect research, practice, and policy The outcome of this suggests the need to consider regional variations when developing interventions and policies addressing gender norms and attitudes towards abortion in Africa."

However, descriptions of apraxic deficits in AD patients are still scarce. Here, we comprehensively investigate apraxia profiles and their impact on general cognitive deficits in patients with biomarker-verified Alzheimer’s pathology.Methods We characterized the frequency and patterns of apraxic deficits in patients with biomarker-verified Alzheimer’s pathology (n=45) using a battery of standardized apraxia tests. Demographic variables and apraxia scores were related to patients’ general cognitive impairment using hierarchical regression analyses.Results Apraxic deficits were found in 78% of patients with biomarker-verified Alzheimer’s pathology. AD patients were more impaired in imitating finger gestures (than hand gestures: 76.6% vs. 87.8%, p < 0.001), and imitating complex hand movements (than single hand movements: 76.3% vs. 96.7%, p < 0.001), even when controlling for general cognitive impairment. Apraxia assessments explained about 60% of the variance related to the severity of general cognitive deficits, with deficits in pantomiming object use (beta coefficient: 0.55, p = 0.017) and imitating finger gestures (beta coefficient: −0.51, p < 0.001) being significant predictors of general cognitive impairment.Conclusions These findings underline the relevance of apraxia in patients with biomarker-verified Alzheimer’s pathology. Data revealed distinct apraxia profiles independent of patients’ general cognitive status and showed that praxis performance, especially apraxic deficits in pantomiming the use of objects and imitating finger gestures, predicts general cognitive functioning in Alzheimer’s disease.What is already known on this topic Apraxic deficits have been commonly reported in patients with suspected Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Current diagnostic criteria of AD include disease-specific biomarkers (i.e., amyloid and tau) reflecting the neuropathological changes in AD. However, little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of apraxia in patients with biomarker-verified Alzheimer’s pathology.What this study adds In a well-defined sample of patients with evidence of Alzheimer’s pathology based on positive amyloid and tau biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET), apraxic deficits are common, show differential patterns even after controlling for general cognitive deficits, and account for variance in the severity of the patients’ general cognitive impairment.How this study might affect research, practice or policy This study shows that in patients with biomarker-verified Alzheimer’s pathology apraxic deficits are a relevant symptom that can predict general cognitive performance in mild to moderate disease stages.Our results warrant further investigation into the neuropathology underlying apraxic deficits in Alzheimer’s disease by examining the relationship between apraxic deficits and regional amyloid and tau deposition in the brain."

We aim to create a data-driven mathematical model of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize patient-specific ICI therapy combined with chemotherapy (ICC).Methods Using patients’ genomic and transcriptomic data, we develop an ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based TIME model to characterize interactions among chemotherapy, ICIs, immune cells, and cancer cells. A DRL algorithm is trained to determine the personalized optimal ICC therapy.Results Numerical experiments with real-world data demonstrates that the proposed TIME model can predict ICI therapy response. The DRL-derived personalized ICC therapy outperforms predefined fixed schedules. For tumors with extremely low CD8+T cell infiltration (“extremely cold tumors”), DRL recommends high-dosage chemotherapy alone. For tumors with higher CD8+T cell infiltration (“cold” and “hot tumors”), an appropriate chemotherapy dosage induces CD8+T cell proliferation, enhancing ICI therapy outcomes. Specifically, for “hot tumors,” chemotherapy and ICI are administered simultaneously, while for “cold tumors,” a mid-dosage of chemotherapy makes the TIME “hotter” before ICI administration. However, a number of “cold tumors” with rapid resistant cancer cell growth, ICC eventually fails.Conclusion This study highlights the potential of utilizing real-world clinical data and DRL to develop personalized optimal ICC by understanding the complex biological dynamics of a patient’s TIME. Our ODE-based TIME model offers a theoretical framework for determining the best use of ICI, and the proposed DRL model may guide personalized ICC schedules.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our research presents a novel data-driven approach to personalized cancer treatment by combining artificial intelligence and mathematical models of the tumor’s surrounding environment, known as the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). This innovative method allows for the optimization of patient-specific immune checkpoint inhibitors and combined chemotherapy therapy. By utilizing deep reinforcement learning, our approach can adapt and improve treatment strategies for individual patients, ultimately maximizing the effectiveness of cancer therapies. This pioneering work has the potential to significantly enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes, paving the way for personalized cancer immunotherapy."

In addition to motor symptoms, a variety of other neurological and psychiatric symptoms may occur in affected individuals, including supranuclear gaze palsy, spasticity, and cognitive decline. Although psychotic symptoms are often reported, response to antipsychotic therapy is not well described in previous case reports/series. As such, we describe treatment response in an individual with Kufor-Rakeb syndrome-associated psychosis. His disease was caused by a homozygous novel loss-of-function ATP13A2 variant (NM_022089.4, c.1970_1975del) that was characterized in this study. Our patient exhibited a good response to quetiapine monotherapy, which he has so far tolerated well. We also reviewed the literature and summarized all previous descriptions of antipsychotic treatment response. Although its use has infrequently been described in Kufor-Rakeb syndrome, quetiapine is commonly used in other degenerative parkinsonian disorders, given its lower propensity to cause extrapyramidal symptoms. As such, quetiapine should be considered in the treatment of Kufor-Rakeb syndrome-associated psychosis, when antipsychotic therapy is deemed necessary."

Clinicians have historically underutilized clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic traditionally reserved for use in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, due to the medication’s adverse effect profile and associated management requirements, concerns of poor treatment adherence, and poor training/exposure to the use. In addition to alleviating schizophrenia symptoms when multiple other medications have failed, clozapine has other unique benefits that compel its use such as its use being associated with reduced suicide ideation and action, aggression, substance use, and all-cause mortality.Methods This study aimed to characterize clozapine utilization by US Medicare patients from 2015-20. Additionally, we identified the states that prescribed significantly different amounts than the national average.Results We observed a steady decrease in clozapine use adjusted for population (−18.0%) and spending (−24.9%) over time. For all years, there was significant geographic heterogeneity (average: nine-fold) in population-corrected clozapine use. Massachusetts (2015-20: 95.4, 82.7, 76.8, 72.2, 71.2, 63.7 prescriptions per thousand enrollees) and South Dakota (2015-20: 78.0, 77.4, 78.4, 75.6, 72.0, 71.6) were the only states that prescribed significantly more than average, and none prescribed significantly less.Discussion Clozapine use by US Medicare patients is low, decreasing, and concerning for underutilization—patterns likewise seen for the US Medicaid recipients. Further study of the reasons for the state variation is needed. Education interventions, training reform, and devices that ease required routine blood monitoring are all practical solutions to optimize clozapine use."

Here, we systematically investigated apraxia profiles in a well-defined group of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD; N=32) who additionally underwent PET imaging with the second-generation tau PET tracer [18F]PI-2620. We hypothesized that specific patterns of tau pathology might be related to apraxic deficits.Methods Patients (N=32) with a biomarker-confirmed diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease were recruited in addition to a sample cognitively unimpaired controls (CU1; N=41). Both groups underwent in-depth neuropsychological assessment of apraxia (Dementia Apraxia Screening Test; DATE and the Cologne Apraxia Screening; KAS). In addition, static PET imaging with [18F]PI-2620 was performed to assess tau pathology in the AD patients. To specifically investigate the association of apraxia with regional tau-pathology, we compared the PET-data from this group with an independent sample of amyloid-negative cognitively intact participants (CU2; N=54) by generation of z-score-deviation maps as well as voxel- based multiple regression analyses.Results We identified significant clusters of tau-aggregation in praxis-related regions (e.g., supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, temporal, parietal and occipital regions) that were associated with apraxia. These regions were similar between the two apraxia assessments. No correlations between tau-tracer uptake in primary motor cortical or subcortical brain regions and apraxia were observed.Conclusions These results suggest that tau deposition in specific cortical brain regions may induce local neuronal dysfunction leading to a dose-dependent functional decline in praxis performance."

DiD assumes that treatment and non-experimental comparison groups would have moved in parallel in expectation, absent the intervention (“parallel trends assumption”). However, the plausibility of parallel trends assumption in the context of infectious disease transmission is not well-understood. Our work bridges this gap by formalizing epidemiological assumptions required for common DiD specifications, positing an underlying Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) data-generating process. We demonstrate that popular specifications can encode strict epidemiological assumptions. For example, DiD modeling incident case numbers or rates as outcomes will produce biased treatment effect estimates unless untreated potential outcomes for treatment and comparison groups come from a data-generating process with the same initial infection and equal transmission rates at each time step. Applying a log transformation or modeling log growth allows for different initial infection rates under an “infinite susceptible population” assumption, but invokes conditions on transmission parameters. We then propose alternative DiD specifications based on epidemiological parameters – the effective reproduction number and the effective contact rate – that are both more robust to differences between treatment and comparison groups and can be extended to complex transmission dynamics. With minimal power difference incidence and log incidence models, we recommend a default of the more robust log specification. Our alternative specifications have lower power than incidence or log incidence models, but have higher power than log growth models. We illustrate implications of our work by re-analyzing published studies of COVID-19 mask policies.Significance Statement Difference-in-differences is a popular observational study design for policy evaluation. However, it may not perform well when modeling infectious disease outcomes. Although many COVID-19 DiD studies in the medical literature have used incident case numbers or rates as the outcome variable, we demonstrate that this and other common model specifications may encode strict epidemiological assumptions as a result of non-linear infectious disease transmission. We unpack the assumptions embedded in popular DiD specifications assuming a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered data-generating process and propose more robust alternatives, modeling the effective reproduction number and effective contact rate."

They are essential for studying life course. Electronic cohorts are live, dynamic longitudinal cohorts using anonymised, routinely collected data. There is no selection bias through direct recruitment, but they are limited to health and administrative system data and may lack contextual information.The MIREDA (Maternal and Infant Research Electronic Data Analysis) partnership creates a UK-wide birth cohort by aligning existing electronic birth cohorts to have the same structure, content, and vocabularies, enabling UK-wide federated analyses.ObjectivesCreate a core dynamic, live UK-wide electronic birth cohort with approximately 100,000 new births per year using a common data model (CDM).Provide data linkage and automation for long-term follow up of births from MuM-PreDiCT and the ‘Born in’ initiatives of Bradford, Wales, Scotland, and South London for comparable analyses.Methods We will establish core data content and collate linkable data. Use a suite of extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) tools will be used to transform the data for each birth cohort into the CDM. Transformed datasets will remain within each cohort’s trusted research environment (TRE). Metadata will be uploaded for the public to the Health Data Research (HDRUK) Innovation Gateway. We will develop a single online data access request for researchers. A cohort profile will be developed for researchers to reference the resource.Ethics Each cohort has approval from their TRE through compliance with their project application processes and information governance.Dissemination We will engage with researchers in the field to promote our resource through partnership networking, publication, research collaborations, conferences, social media, and marketing communications strategies."

Traditional views link frontal brain region damage with verb processing deficits and posterior temporoparietal damage with noun difficulties. However, this perspective is contested by findings from patients with Alzheimer’s disease (pwAD), who show impairments in both word classes despite their typical temporoparietal atrophy. Notably, pwAD tend to use semantically lighter verbs in their speech than healthy individuals. By examining English-speaking pwAD and comparing them with Persian-speaking pwAD, this research aims to demonstrate that language impairments in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) stem from the distributional properties of words within a language rather than distinct neural processing networks for nouns and verbs. We propose that the primary deficit in AD language production is an overreliance on high-frequency words. English has a set of particularly high-frequency verbs that surpass most nouns in usage frequency. Since pwAD tend to use high-frequency words, the byproduct of this word distribution in the English language would be an over-usage of high-frequency verbs. In contrast, Persian features complex verbs with an overall distribution lacking extremely high-frequency verbs like those found in English. As a result, we hypothesize that Persian-speaking pwAD would not have a bias toward the overuse of high-frequency verbs.We analyzed language samples from 95 English-speaking pwAD and 91 healthy controls, along with 27 Persian-speaking pwAD and 27 healthy controls. Employing uniform automated natural language processing methods, we measured the usage rates of nouns, verbs, and word frequencies across both cohorts.Our findings showed that English-speaking pwAD use higher-frequency verbs than healthy individuals, a pattern not mirrored by Persian-speaking pwAD. Crucially, we found a significant interaction between the frequencies of verbs used by English and Persian speakers with and without AD. Moreover, regression models that treated noun and verb frequencies as separate predictors did not outperform models that considered overall word frequency alone in classifying AD.In conclusion, this study suggests that language abnormalities among English-speaking pwAD reflect the unique distributional properties of words in English rather than a universal noun-verb class distinction. Beyond offering a new understanding of language abnormalities in AD, the study highlights the critical need for further investigation across diverse languages to deepen our insight into the mechanisms of language impairments in neurological disorders."

This study aimed to evaluate the significance of biological age predicted through the analysis of sleep stages and nocturnal heart rhythms as a marker for cardiovascular risk.Methods We leveraged an unsupervised learning approach to generate time-series clusters utilizing whole-night sleep data from N = 900 patients, focusing on identifying shifts and consistencies in nocturnal heart rhythms that may indicate variations in cardiac health. Following this, a deep learning model was applied to the time-series clusters to estimate the biological age of the individuals, thereby delineating potential relationships between predicted age, biological age, sleep patterns, and heart rhythms.Results In a distinct test set of 736 individuals, the predicted age based on this experiment showcased a higher association with mortality (Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.27, p<0.05) and CVD risk (HR 3.56, p<0.001). Conversely, the age estimated through only nocturnal heart rhythms demonstrated a HR of 2.29 (p<0.05) for all-cause mortality and 3.13 (p<0.01) for CVD risk.Conclusion Our findings underscore the high prognostic potential of sleep and electrocardiography data in predicting cardiovascular risks. The method of utilizing predicted biological age derived from sleep stages and nocturnal heart rhythms stands as a significant metric in risk stratification for CVD. Further research in this area might foster novel strategies for early interventions based on sleep quality and cardiac health markers, potentially saving numerous lives through early detection and intervention.Author summary This study conducted on a large database of sleep data containing physiological signals such as Electrocardiograms, Sleep Stages, anonymized patient information among others shows that the heart behaviour during sleep is indicative of future cardiovascular (CVD) risk and all-cause mortality. This study employs deep learning to predict biological age which is in turn mapped to CVD risk. Through this study, we can see that while heart rhythms during sleep and different stages of sleep (REM, light sleep, etc) does show an association with CVD risk (this exists in previous literature), the more reliable association is found in heart behaviour during specific sleep stages (which is the novelty of our work). We use deep learning to map ECG into different clusters (n=50) using self-supervised learning, and also to find correlation between these clusters and sleep stages while mapping them to their biological age."

The aim of this study was to develop a typology that describes the diverse set of activities through which corporations influence population health and health equity across industries.Methods We conducted a scoping review of articles using CDH terms (n=116) that discuss corporate activities that can influence population health and health equity across 16 industries. We used the qualitative constant comparison method to build a typology called the Corporate Influences on Population Health (HEALTH-CORP) typology.Results The HEALTH-CORP typology identifies 70 corporate activities that can influence health across industries and categorizes them into seven domains of corporate influence (e.g., political practices, employment practices). We present a model that situates these domains based on their proximity to health outcomes and identify five population groups (e.g., workers, local communities) to consider when evaluating corporate health impacts.Discussion The HEALTH-CORP typology facilitates an understanding of the diverse set of corporate activities that can influence population health and the population groups affected by these activities. We discuss the utility of these contributions in terms of identifying interventions to address the CDH and advancing efforts to measure and monitor the CDH. We also leverage our findings to identify key gaps in CDH literature and suggest avenues for future research."

We assessed longitudinal serum anti-RBD antibody levels and neutralizing activities (NTs) against Omicron BA.5 and XBB.1.5 in healthcare workers following the fourth monovalent and fifth bivalent BA.4-5 vaccines. The occurrence of BIs was also followed, and pre-infection antibody levels were compared between patients who developed BI and those who did not. In addition, we collected whole blood samples on the same day as the sera and stored them on filter papers (nos. 545, 590, and 424) for up to two months, then measured their NTs using dried blood spots (DBS) eluates, and compared them with the NTs in paired sera. Pre-infection levels of NTs were lower in patients who developed BI than those who did not, but the anti-RBD antibody levels were not different between them. The NTs below 50% using 200-fold diluted sera might be one of the indicators of high risk for COVID-19 BI. However, the NTs against XBB.1.5 at 6 months after the fifth dose of bivalent BA.4-5 vaccine were lower than this threshold in almost half of infection-naïve participants. NTs measured using DBS eluates were strongly correlated with those measured using paired sera, but the time and temperature stability varied with the type of filter paper; no. 545 filter paper was found to most suitable for NT evaluation."

Therefore, we systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials comparing telehealth to face-to-face provision of SLP services.Methods We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane, clinical trial registries, and conducted a citation analysis to identify trials. We included randomized trials comparing similar care delivered live via telehealth (phone or video), to face-to-face. Primary outcomes included: % syllables stuttered (%SS) (for individuals who stutter); change in sound pressure levels monologue (for individuals with Parkinson’s disease); and key function scores (for other areas). Where data were sufficient, mean differences were calculated.Results Nine randomized controlled trials were included; 8 evaluated video and 1 evaluated phone telehealth. Risk of bias was generally low or unclear, excepting blinding. There were no significant differences at any time-point up to 18 months for %SS (mean difference, MD 0.1, 95% CI –0.4 to 0.6, p=0.70). For people with Parkinson’s disease, there was no difference between groups in change in sound pressure levels (monologue) (MD 0.6, 95% CI –1.2 to 2.5, p=0.49). Four trials investigated interventions for speech sound disorder, voice disorder, and post-stroke dysphagia and aphasia; they found no differences between telehealth service delivery and face-to-face delivery.Conclusions Evidence suggests that the telehealth provision of SLP services may be a viable alternative to their provision face-to-face, particularly to people who stutter and people with Parkinson’s disease. The key limitation is the small number of randomized controlled trials, as well as evidence on the quality of life, well-being and satisfaction, and economic outcomes."

Cortical location is known to be associated with increased risk of PSE. However, relationship between the involvement of specific lobe with stroke and PSE has not been evaluated in a meta-analysis due to unavailability of relevant data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis on this subject matter.Methods The PubMed and Embase databases were comprehensively assessed and searched for studies that evaluated the association between the involvement of different lobes with PSE. Studies that evaluated post-stroke epilepsy or recurrent post-stroke seizure were included, and acute symptomatic seizure was excluded. Following search strategy was used, “post-stroke” OR “stroke” OR “intracerebral hemorrhage” AND “epilepsy” OR “seizure” AND “lobe” OR “territory” OR “location”. Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tool was utilized to perform quality assessment of the included studies. A random effects model was used to estimate pooled odds ratio of the selected outcomes with 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs), and the study heterogeneity was analyzed.Results Nine studies3-11 were identified with 1328 stroke patients. 9/9 studies showed association of frontal lobe involvement with higher likelihood of PSE (OR=2.10, 95% CI=1.37-3.21, p-value=0.0007). All studies showed association of parietal stroke with increased likelihood of PSE (OR=2.85, 95% CI=1.93-4.22, p-value<0.00001). Previous temporal lobe stroke was associated with increased risk of PSE (OR=3.55, 95% CI=1.95-6.45, p-value<0.00001). In contrast, association between occipital lobe involvement and PSE was not statistically significant (OR=1.37, 95% CI=0.95-1.96, p-value<0.09), and this remained true when subgroup analysis was performed.Discussion Our meta-analysis shows that PSE is associated with frontal, parietal, and temporal involvement of previous stroke. There was no statistically significant association between occipital lobe involvement and PSE. Further high quality studies are needed to investigate if stroke in one lobe/territory can be more epileptogenic than those in others.Key PointsCerebrovascular disease is the most common etiology of newly diagnosed epilepsyPrior stroke involving the frontal, temporal, or parietal lobe is associated with increased risk of post-stroke epilepsyOccipital lobe stroke is not associated with increased risk of post-stroke epilepsy, regardless of the age group."

Clemastine fumarate, the over-the-counter antihistamine and muscarinic receptor blocker, has remyelinating potential in MS. A clemastine arm was added to an ongoing platform clinical trial TRAP-MS (NCT03109288) to identify a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remyelination signature and to collect safety data on clemastine in patients progressing independently of relapse activity (PIRA). The clemastine arm was stopped per protocol-defined criteria when 3/9 patients triggered individual safety stopping criteria (χ2 p=0.00015 compared to remaining TRAP-MS treatments). Clemastine treated patients had significantly higher treatment-induced disability progression slopes compared to remaining TRAP-MS participants (p=0.0075). Quantification of ∼7000 proteins in CSF samples collected before and after clemastine treatment showed significant increase in purinergic/ATP signaling and pyroptosis cell death. Mechanistic studies showed that clemastine with sub-lytic doses of extracellular ATP activates inflammasome and induces pyroptotic cell death in macrophages. Clemastine with ATP also caused pyroptosis of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human oligodendrocytes. Antagonist of the purinergic channel P2RX7 that is strongly expressed in oligodendrocytes and myeloid cells, blocked these toxic effects of clemastine. Finally, re-analyses of published snRNAseq studies revealed increased P2RX7 expression and pyroptosis transcriptional signature in microglia and oligodendrocytes in MS brain, especially in chronic active lesions. CSF proteomic pyroptosis score was increased in untreated MS patients, was higher in patients with progressive than relapsing-remitting disease and correlated significantly with rates of MS progression. Thus, pyroptosis is likely first well-characterized mechanism of CNS injury underlying PIRA even outside of clemastine toxicity.One Sentence Summary Clemastine enhanced disability accumulation in patients progressing by non-lesional MS activity by potentiating intrathecal P2RX7 signaling and pyroptosis."

Using a candidate set of 2232 genes that are listed as targets for all approved treatments in the DrugBank database each gene was independently assigned two scores for each disorder – one based on its involvement as a treatment target, and the other based on the mapping between GWAS-implicated SNPs and genes according to one of four bioinformatic data modalities: SNP position, gene distance on the protein interaction network (PPI), brain eQTL, and gene expression patterns across the brain.Main Outcomes and Measures Gene scores for pharmacological treatments and GWAS-implicated genes were compared using a novel measure of weighted similarity applying a stringent null hypothesis-testing framework that quantified the specificity of the match by comparing identified associations for a particular disorder to a randomly selected set of treatments.Results Incorporating information derived from functional bioinformatics data in the form of PPI network revealed links for bipolar disorder (pperm = 0.0001), however, the overall correspondence between treatment targets and GWAS-implicated genes in psychiatric disorders rarely exceeded null expectations. Exploratory analysis assessing the overlap between the GWAS-identified genetic architecture and treatment targets across disorders identified that most disorder pairs and mapping methods did not show a significant correspondence.Conclusions and Relevance The relatively low degree of correspondence across modalities suggests that the genetic architecture driving the risk for psychiatric disorders may be distinct from the pathophysiological mechanisms used for targeting symptom manifestations through pharmacological treatments and that novel approaches for understanding and treating psychiatric disorders may be required.Question Do genes targeted by current treatments for psychiatric disorders match GWAS-identified genetic variation and what bioinformatic data modalities can inform these associations?Findings Information derived from functional bioinformatics data in the form of PPI network revealed links for bipolar disorder, however for most psychiatric disorders, the correspondence between GWAS-implicated genes and treatment targets did not exceed null expectations.Meaning GWAS-identified genetic variation driving the risk for psychiatric disorders may be distinct from the pathophysiological mechanisms influencing symptom onset and severity that are targeted by pharmacological treatments."

Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the efficacy of psychological interventions for pediatric PTSD. Yet, a comprehensive network meta-analysis (NMA) is lacking. The present work addresses this gap. A total of 67 RCTs met the inclusion criteria comprising 5,297 children and adolescents with full or sub-threshold PTSD. Five families of intervention were evaluated: trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), other trauma-focused interventions, non-trauma-focused (non-TF) interventions, and multi-disciplinary treatments (MDTs). Most RCTs (73%) examined TF-CBT followed by EMDR. Other trauma-focused interventions had too few trials for analysis. At treatment endpoint, TF-CBT, EMDR, MDTs, and non-TF interventions were all effective in treating pediatric PTSD when compared to passive control conditions in random-effect NMA with large pooled effects (all Hedges’ gs ≥ 0.84, all ps < .001). TF-CBT, EMDR, and MDTs also yielded significant short-term treatment effects compared to active control conditions. In a sensitivity analysis including only high-quality trials, only TF-CBT and EMDR outperformed active control conditions. And in a sensitivity analysis including only trials with ≥ 50% of participants reporting multiple-event-related PTSD, only TF-CBT yielded significant short-term effects. Results for mid-term (up to 5 months posttreatment) and long-term efficacy (beyond 5 months posttreatment) were very similar. TF-CBT consistently yielded the highest treatment effects except being second to EMDR at mid-term. The present NMA is the most comprehensive NMA of psychological interventions for pediatric PTSD to date. Results confirm that TF-CBT can effectively treat PTSD in children and adolescents both in the short and long-term and also for multiple-event-related PTSD. More long-term data and multiple-event-related PTSD data are needed for EMDR, MDTs, and non-TF interventions to draw firmer conclusions regarding their efficacy. Results for TF-CBT are encouraging for clinical practice and may help to reduce common treatment barriers."

This effect might arise from incomplete consideration of within-season waning and recent infection. Using data from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) Network (2011-2012 to 2018-2019 seasons), we found that repeat vaccinees were vaccinated earlier in a season by one week. After accounting for waning VE, repeat vaccinees were still more likely to test positive for A(H3N2) (OR=1.11, 95%CI:1.02-1.21) but not for influenza B or A(H1N1). We found that clinical infection influenced individuals’ decision to vaccinate in the following season while protecting against clinical infection of the same (sub)type. However, adjusting for recent clinical infections did not strongly influence the estimated effect of prior-season vaccination. In contrast, we found that adjusting for subclinical infection could theoretically attenuate this effect. Additional investigation is needed to determine the impact of subclinical infections on VE.Summary of main points: Two potential factors, timing of vaccination and clinical infection history, cannot fully explain the increased influenza infection risk in repeat vaccinees compared with non-repeat vaccinees. Subclinical infection in the previous season may explain the effect."

To untangle sex-related effects on health and disease it is important to model sex-related differences better.Methods Data came from the baseline visit of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), a longitudinal cohort study following 16,415 individuals recruited at baseline from four study sites: Bronx NY, Miami FL, San Diego CA, and Chicago IL. We applied LASSO penalized logistic regression of male versus female sex over sociodemographic, acculturation, and psychological factors jointly. Two “gendered indices”, GISE and GIPSE, summarizing the sociodemographic environment (GISE, primary) and psychosocial and sociodemographic environment (GIPSE, secondary) associated with sex, were calculated by summing these variables, weighted by their regression coefficients. We examined the association of these indices with insomnia derived from self-reported symptoms assessed via the Women Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale (WHIIRS), a phenotype with strong sex differences, in sex-adjusted and sex-stratified analyses. All analyses were adjusted for age, Hispanic/Latino background, and study center.Results The distribution of GISE and GIPSE differed by sex with higher values in male individuals, even when constructing and validating them on separate, independent, subsets of HCHS/SOL individuals. In an association model with insomnia, male sex was associated with lower likelihood of insomnia (odds ratio (OR)=0.60, 95% CI (0.53, 0.67)). Including GISE in the model, the association was slightly weaker (OR=0.63, 95% CI (0.56, 0.70)), and weaker when including instead GIPSE in the association model (OR=0.78, 95% CI (0.69, 0.88)). Higher values of GISE and of GIPSE, more common in male sex, were associated with lower likelihood of insomnia, in analyses adjusted for sex (per 1 standard deviation of the index, GISE OR= 0.92, 95% CI (0.87, 0.99), GIPSE OR=0.65, 95% CI (0.61, 0.70)).Conclusions New measures such as GISE and GIPSE capture sex-related differences beyond binary sex and have the potential to better model and inform research studies of health. However, such indices do not account for gender identity and may not well capture the environment experienced by intersex and non-binary persons."

Ninety-day mortality and anastomosis leakage are critical early postoperative problems traditionally analysed through logistic regression. In this study, we challenge traditional logistic regression models to predict results with new explainable AI (XAI) models. We used the Swedish National Quality Register for Oesophageal and Gastric Cancer (NREV) to perform traditional multivariable logistic regression and XAI. The 90-day mortality was 6.0%, while anastomosis leakage was present in 12.4%. The XAI models yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 for 90-day mortality (as compared with 0.84 for logistic regression). For anastomosis leakage, the AUC was 0.84 using XAI (0.74 using logistic regression). We show that age (mortality increases sharply after 55 years) and body mass index (BMI) (lowest mortality for BMI 30 kg/m2) are important survival factors. Additionally, we show that surgery time (minimum anastomosis leakage for a surgery time of 200 min to sharply increase to a maximum at 375 min) and BMI (the lower the BMI, the less anastomosis leakage) are important factors for anastomosis leakage. The surgical understanding of anastomosis leakage and mortality after oesophagectomy is advanced by judiciously applying XAI to structured data. Our nationwide oesophagectomy data contains significant nonlinear relationships. With the help of XAI, we extract personalised knowledge, bringing oesophagus surgery one step closer to personalised medicine."

Technical limitations have excluded the spinal cord from imaging-based research. Available data are restricted to few microstructural analyses. Functional connectivity data are absent. The present study sought to address this gap of knowledge and assess alterations in cortical and spinal cord activation and changes in corticospinal coupling in chronic stroke. Thirteen well-recovered patients underwent combined cortical and spinal functional MRI while performing a simple visually guided force generation task. Task-related activation was localized in ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1), premotor ventral cortex (PMV), and supplementary motor area (SMA), as well as in the cervical spinal cord. Psycho-physiological interactions and linear modelling were used to infer functional connectivity between cortical motor regions and the cervical spinal cord and their associations with motor deficits. The main finding was that PMV and SMA showed topographically distinct alterations in their connectivity with the spinal cord. Specifically, for SMA, we found a reduced coupling with voxels localised in the ipsilateral ventral spinal cord. For PMV, an enhanced coupling was detected with ventral, and intermediate central spinal zones. Lower SMA- and higher PMV-related spinal cord couplings located in similar areas were directly correlated with residual deficits. Collectively, this work provides first-in-human functional insights into stroke-related alterations in the functional connectivity between cortical motor areas and the spinal cord with patterns of directionality and topography suggesting that different premotor areas and spinal neuronal assemblies might be differentially prone to and involved in coupling changes. It adds a novel, promising approach to better understand stroke recovery in general, and to develop innovative models to comprehend groundbreaking treatment strategies with spinal cord stimulation."

This study aimed to examine associations between healthful and unhealthful plant-based dietary patterns with risk of mortality among CKD patients for the first time.Methods This prospective analysis included 4,807 UK Biobank participants with CKD at baseline. We examined associations of adherence to both the healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI), calculated from repeated 24-hour dietary assessments, with risk of mortality using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models.Results Over a 10-year follow-up, 675 deaths were recorded. Participants with the highest hPDI scores had a 33% lower risk of mortality [HRQ4vsQ1 (95% CI): 0.67 (0.53-0.84), ptrend = <0.001], while those with the highest uPDI scores had a 49% higher risk [1.49 (1.18-1.89), ptrend = 0.004], compared to participants with the lowest respective scores and following adjustment for other dietary and lifestyle factors. In food group-specific analyses, higher wholegrain intakes were associated with a 29% lower mortality risk, while intakes of refined grains, and sugar-sweetened beverages were associated a 28% and 31% higher risk, respectively.Conclusions In CKD patients, a higher intake of healthy plant-based foods was associated with a lower risk of mortality, while a higher intake of unhealthy plant-based foods was associated with a higher risk. These results underscore the importance of plant food quality and support the potential role of healthy plant food consumption in the treatment and management of CKD to mitigate unfavourable outcomes."

Free-living diet studies have been traditionally challenged by difficulties in controlling adherence to prescribed calories and macronutrient content and rarely allow a period of metabolic stability prior to metabolic measures (to minimize influences of weight changes). In this context, key physiologic measures central to precision nutrition responses may be most precisely quantified via whole room indirect calorimetry over 24-h, in which precise control of activity and nutrition can be achieved. In addition, these studies represent unique “N of 1” human crossover metabolic-physiologic experiments during which specific molecular pathways central to nutrient metabolism may be discerned. Here, we quantified 263 circulating metabolites during a ≈40-day inpatient admission in which up to 94 participants underwent seven monitored 24-h nutritional interventions of differing macronutrient composition in a whole-room indirect calorimeter to capture precision metabolic responses. Broadly, we observed heterogenous responses in metabolites across dietary chambers, with the exception of carnitines which tracked with 24-h respiratory quotient. We identified excursions in shared metabolic species (e.g., carnitines, glycerophospholipids, amino acids) that mapped onto gold-standard calorimetric measures of substrate oxidation preference and lipid availability. These findings support a coordinated metabolic-physiologic response to nutrition, highlighting the relevance of these controlled settings to uncover biological pathways of energy utilization during precision nutrition studies."

We applied eligibility criteria regarding food groups and cut-off limits for three critical nutrients stipulated by regulations to identify products eligible for FOPNL. We classified the food and beverage according to the NOVA classification, identified the products with added sugars information in the nutrition facts panel and those with FOPNL for added sugar, saturated fat or sodium. Moreover, we analyzed the temporal trends in FOPNL presence among eligible products during the study period. Last, a subsample of 202 product labels was analyzed to identify non-compliance with FOPNL readability standards.Results 63.9% of the products analyzed were eligible for at least one critical nutrient’s FOPNL; however, only 12.9% already featured FOPNL by the end of the 12-month implementation period. Among ultra-processed products, 65.1% were supposed to have FOPNL, but only 14.4% did. Less than 30% of sweet cookies, ice cream, tabletop sweeteners, and candies with added sugar in the list of ingredients declared this information in the nutritional facts panel. Analysis of label images revealed non-compliance with FOPNL readability regarding its location on the packaging, FOPNL in removable parts of the packaging or hidden positions, and inadequate color pattern and format.Conclusion The implementation of the nutrition labeling regulations in Brazil within the first 12 months reached less than 15% of eligible foods and beverages, indicating non-compliance by the food industry. In this period, almost all new launched products available in the market should have been compliant with the new regulations. Such inadequacies undermine the expected impact of promoting healthier choices at the point of food purchase."

However, its utility in neurodegenerative diseases, like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), remains underexplored. Existing biomarker discovery approaches are tailored to a specific disease context or are too expensive to be clinically practical. Here, we address these challenges through a new approach combining advances in molecular and computational technologies. First, we develop statistical tools to select tissue-informative DNA methylation sites relevant to a disease process of interest. We then employ a capture protocol to select these sites and perform targeted methylation sequencing. Multi-modal information about the DNA methylation patterns are then utilized in machine learning algorithms trained to predict disease status and disease progression. We applied our method to two independent cohorts of ALS patients and controls (n=192). Overall, we found that the targeted sites accurately predicted ALS status and replicated between cohorts. Additionally, we identified epigenetic features associated with ALS phenotypes, including disease severity. These findings highlight the potential of cfDNA as a non-invasive biomarker for ALS."

We aimed to gather views of healthcare professionals on current and future regulation and provision of abortion in Britain.Design Cross sectional, stratified cluster sample survey with additional free text comments.Setting Healthcare settings in BritainParticipants Healthcare professionals (nurses, doctors, midwives, pharmacists) working in a range of healthcare services, including dedicated abortion services.Measures Knowledge of and attitudes towards the regulation and provision of abortion.Results 771 healthcare professionals from all areas of Britain responded to the survey. Support for abortion being a woman’s choice was high, more than nine in ten saw it as such and a clear majority favoured abortion being treated as a health rather than a legal issue. Only 6.2% saw abortion at any gestational age as contrary to their personal beliefs and a similarly small minority (6.7%) were against abortion after 12 weeks gestation. One in five of all healthcare professionals and a third of those aged under 30 were unaware that the law in Britain requires two doctors to authorise an abortion. Free text comments revealed opposition to the need for this legal requirement. Support for an extended role for nurses in abortion care was high; two thirds (65.3%) agreed that nurses should be able to prescribe abortion medication. Little more than a third of all healthcare professionals (37%) agreed that abortion should be standard practice in their service; the proportion was highest among those in sexual and reproductive health services (58.4%) and lowest among those in general practice (18.7%).Conclusions Health care professionals in Britain are generally supportive of abortion being treated in the same way as other health issues and would be likely to support any moves to decriminalise abortion.Strengths and limitations of the studyStrengths and limitations of the studyThe study describes the views of a range of healthcare professionals in different specialities and settings on the current and future regulation and provision of abortion.The use of a stratified cluster sampling strategy increases the generalisability of findings.Additional qualitative data from free text comments helps in understanding the survey responses.The main limitation stems from the timing of the study. Scheduling fieldwork at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and its immediate aftermath may have introduced both participation and reporting bias.Healthcare professionals most actively involved in coping with the pandemic may have declined to participate because of time pressures and/or provided responses influenced by awareness of the current constraints of their workload.What is already known on this topicWhat is already known on this topicThe 21st century has seen major changes in the landscape of abortion. Therapeutic and technological advances have led to an increase in the prevalence of medication abortion which can be safely managed by women at home and have provided the innovative telemedical interventions enabling them to do so.The trends have prompted reflection on the appropriate regulation of abortion in Britain, on the role of different cadres of healthcare professionals; and on the appropriate healthcare settings in which abortion can be provided. Little is known about the views of health care professionals on these issues.What this study addsWhat this study addsThe law on abortion is not widely known. One in five of all health care professionals and one in three aged under 30 are not aware that for abortion to be legal in Britain two doctors must certify that certain grounds have been met.There is near universal support among healthcare professionals for abortion being a woman’s choice and a widely held view that abortion should be treated no differently from any other health condition.Enthusiasm for incorporating abortion into existing practice is high among healthcare professionals employed in sexual and reproductive health services but most of those in general practice see abortion provision as out of scope for their service.An extended role in abortion for nurses commands considerable support among healthcare professionals, including prescribing abortion medication and, whilst the legal requirement to do so remains, to authorise abortions.How this study might affect research, practice or policyHow this study might affect research, practice or policyShould there be political will in Britain for a legal reform that removes specific criminal prohibitions against abortion, our data suggest that it would encounter strong support amongst healthcare professionals."

Analysis of OGTT data using the Oral Minimal Model (OMM) along with the rate of appearance of ingested glucose (Ra) is performed to study differences in model parameters for control and T2DM groups. The differentiation of parameters of the model gives insight into the behaviour and physiology of T2DM. The model is also studied to find parameter differences among obese and non-obese T2DM subjects and the sensitive parameters were co-related to the known physiological findings. Sensitivity analysis is performed to understand changes in parameter values with model output and to support the findings, appropriate statistical tests are done. This seems to be the first preliminary application of the OMM with obesity as a distinguishing factor in understanding T2DM from estimated parameters of insulin-glucose model and relating the statistical differences in parameters to diabetes pathophysiology.HighlightsAn established oral minimal model is used for estimation of parameters obese and non-obese type 2 diabetes.This is a novel attempt to use oral minimal model to co-relate the parameters for different diabetic groups using oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) data.The data of different diabetes groups were utilised for model parameter determination and through statistical tests, distinctions in parameter distribution were identified.It was observed that obese diabetic group are more insulin resistant compared to non-obese diabetic group."

It remains uncertain whether 10-year ASCVD risk can accurately predict the mortality impact of lipid-lowering therapy.Methods A retrospective analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (III and 1999-2008) linked to the National Death Index was conducted with propensity score matching. The study included 6647 adults without lipid-lowering therapy and 2484 with lipid-lowering therapy. Cox regression models and C statistic were used to assess the association between 10-year ASCVD risk and mortality.Results In the matched cohort with 4802 individuals with similar ASCVD risks, 10-year risk of ASCVD by PCE was comparable for predicating all-cause mortality at 10 years in the lipid-lowering therapy group (area under curve [AUC], 0.75; 95% CI 0.73-0.77) and without lipid-lowering therapy (0.74; 95% CI 0.71-0.77; P = 0.50). Similarly, PCE was comparable for predicting cardiovascular mortality at 10 years in both groups (AUC, 0.75; 95% CI 0.70-0.79 versus 0.77; 95% CI 0.73-0.80; P = 0.47). Lipid-lowering therapy was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% CI 0.61-0.82; P < 0.01) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51-0.83; P < 0.01), particularly in those with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher.Conclusions PCE provides comparable predictions of mortality in individuals with and without lipid-lowering therapy. Moreover, individuals on lipid-lowering therapy exhibited lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared to those without lipid-lowering therapy but with a similar 10-year risk of ASCVD. These findings suggest that mortality risk reduction can be assessed by 10-year ASCVD risk estimated by PCE for primary prevention both prior and after treatment."

Parents’ dental care knowledge and practice affect their children’s oral health. Thus, this study assessed the oral hygiene knowledge and practice in mothers of children aged 5-9 years.Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 January to 31 December 2022 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Mothers’ oral hygiene knowledge and practices were assessed through a semi-structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis including the Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal– Wallis one-way ANOVA test were performed to show average knowledge and practice variations among different socio-demographics of mothers.Results Out of 400 samples, the mean age of mothers was 30.94±5.15 years where majority were in Muslim faith (97%), housewife (86.8%) and came from nuclear family (68.0%). The prevalence of good knowledge was 41.2%, following 21.5% had moderately average, 18.8% had average and 18.5% mothers had poor knowledge respectively on their children’s oral hygiene. On the other hand, 45.5% mothers had good practice, following 19.5% had average practice, 18.8% had moderately average and 16.2% had poor practice behavior. Mothers’ knowledge levels were significantly (p<0.05) associated with age, education, family size, and monthly income. On the other hand, educational status and income was significantly (p<0.05) associated with mothers’ oral hygiene practices. Non-parametric analysis revealed that the average knowledge level was significantly (p<0.05) higher with respect to higher age group, educational attainment, currently working status, and whose family income was high. On the other hand, oral hygiene practice level was significantly (p<0.05) higher among mother having higher education and higher family income. Mothers’ knowledge was significantly (p<0.05) and positively correlated with the practice behavior obtained by Pearson correlation coefficient.Conclusions The revealed that the knowledge and practices of mothers directly influence the oral hygiene behavior of children. Mothers with sound knowledge tend to exhibit positive practices concerning their children’s oral hygiene. These findings underscore the importance of taking necessary actions to enhance both the knowledge and practices related to oral hygiene among mothers, thereby ensuring the well-being of their children."

However, the identification of eligible patients within EHRs presents considerable challenges. In this study, we developed a pipeline for phenotyping eligibility criteria, enabling the identification of patients from EHRs with clinical characteristics that match those criteria. We utilized clinical trial eligibility criteria from ClinicalTrials.gov and patient EHRs from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse. The criteria and EHR data were normalized using national standard terminologies and in-house databases, facilitating computability and queryability. The pipeline employed rule-based pattern recognition and manual annotation. The quality of normalization was assessed using Cohen’s Kappa, with the precision, recall, and F1 score evaluated for patient matching. Our pipeline normalized 367 out of 640 unique eligibility criteria attributes, covering various medical conditions including non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and sickle cell anemia. 174 were encoded with standard terminologies and 193 were normalized using the in-house reference tables. The agreement between automated and manual normalization was high (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.82), and patient matching demonstrated a 0.94 F1 score. We developed a clinical phenotyping pipeline that improved the integration of eligibility criteria with EHR data. This system was successfully tested on EHRs from multiple institutions, indicating its wide applicability. The pipeline has the potential to greatly improve EHR use in clinical trial processes, leading to better patient selection and enhanced clinical research outcomes.Question Can the clinical trial eligibility criteria attributes and patient clinical characteristics in EHRs be structuralized and normalized to improve their computability and queryability?Findings Our clinical phenotyping pipeline effectively mapped the eligibility criteria and patient EHR data to enable automated matching.Meaning Our study could significantly improve the identification of eligible patient cohorts for clinical trials, thus making the process of patient recruitment more efficient."

With the increasing digitalisation of services, in particular those provided in Social Care in Wales, it is important to understand how best to support older adults to overcome the challenges they face with accessing or engaging with the digital world (for personal use). This rapid review aimed to assess the effectiveness of interventions to address digital exclusion in older adults (aged 60 years and above). Digital exclusion can occur due to issues with motivation (if people do not see why the internet might be beneficial), accessibility (unable to physically access to the internet), ability (lack of skills to use the internet) or affordability (unable to afford access to the internet) of digital technology.Research Implications and Evidence Gaps The majority of studies included in this review were of low quality. It is unclear whether study findings would be generalisable to the UK. Outcome measures were heterogeneous across studies making it difficult to compare findings directly. Only one study assessed the cost-effectiveness of a digital education intervention. No study reported on interventions to address language barriers, for example, that may be experienced by people whose first language is not English. No study focused specifically on interventions to improve access to, or affordability of the internet and digital technologies to overcome digital exclusion. Further high-quality UK-based research is needed to better understand the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions for addressing digital exclusion in older adults.Policy and Practice Implications This rapid review highlighted the potential benefits of a range of complex multi-component educational interventions, particularly with regards to improving digital literacy, and suggests that older adults are accepting of these interventions. To reduce digital exclusion in older adults, evidence suggests it may be important to ensure structural barriers, such as access to the internet and affordability of devices are removed. However, the cost of provision should be considered and assessed. Educational interventions may help to reduce perceptual barriers regarding digital technologies that contribute to digital exclusion including lack of confidence, fear and anxiety, or perceived lack of abilities. It is important to consider that older adults should be equipped with the skills to make an informed choice to interact with essential services physically (offline) or digitally. With the increasing digitalisation of services, it is important that older members of the community who do not wish to use digital technologies, are not left behind or disadvantaged.Funding statement Public Health Wales were funded for this work by the Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre, itself funded by Health and Care Research Wales on behalf of Welsh Government."

Recent progress has been made in identifying biological correlates of AN, but more research is needed to pinpoint the specific mechanisms that lead to its development and maintenance. There is a known phenotypic link between AN, growth and sexual maturation, yet the genetic overlap between these phenotypes remains enigmatic. One may hypothesize that shared factors between AN, energy metabolism and reproductive functions may have been under recent evolutionary selection. Here, we characterize the genetic overlap between AN, BMI and age at menarche, and aimed to reveal recent evolutionary factors that may help explain the origin of AN. We obtained publicly available GWAS summary statistics of AN, BMI and age at menarche and studied the polygenic overlap between them. Next, we used Neandertal Selective Sweep scores to explore recent evolutionary selection. We found 22 loci overlapping between AN and BMI, and 9 loci between AN and age at menarche, with 7 of these not previously associated with AN. We found that loci associated with AN may have been under particular evolutionary dynamic. Chronobiology appeared relevant to the studied genetic overlaps and prone to recent evolutionary selection, offering a promising avenue for future research. Taken together, our findings contribute to the understanding of the genetic underpinning of AN. Ultimately, better knowledge of the biological origins of AN may help to target specific biological processes and facilitate early intervention in individuals who are most at risk."

This study explored differences in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported for beta-lactams between each of these infusion protocols.Methods A systematic review of MEDLINE literature databases via PubMed was conducted and references were compiled. Articles were compiled and assessed with specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. We included randomized and nonrandomized, prospective, and retrospective cohort studies that reported adverse effects due to either standard (30-60 mins) or prolonged (≥3 hours) infusions of beta-lactam infusions. Total ADRs between strategies were analyzed by infusion methodology. The most consistently reported ADRs were subject to meta-analysis across studies.Results 13 studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria with data for 4184 patients. There was insufficient data to systematically analyze neurotoxicity or cytopenias. Eight studies reported on nephrotoxicity outcomes with no significant difference in event rates between standard (n=440/2117, 20.8%) vs prolonged infusion (n=264/1284, 20.6%) of beta-lactams (OR=1.09, 95% CI [0.91, 1.30]). Six studies reported on rates of diarrhea with no significant difference in event rates between standard (n=21/359, 5.8%) vs prolonged infusion (n=25/330, 7.6%) of beta-lactams (OR=1.33, 95% CI [0.71,2.47).Conclusion Prolonged and standard infusion schemes for beta-lactams demonstrated adverse effects at similar rates for both infusion schemes. Future research should focus on improved standardization of adverse effect definitions and a priori aim to study neurotoxicity and cytopenias. Consistent recording of ADRs and standardized definitions of these reactions will be paramount to further study of this subject."

Typically, such data can only measure association (rather than causation) and include only a subset of the diseases we may be interested in.Objective In this paper, we complement the evidence from such analyses by learning an overarching causal network model over twelve health conditions from the Google Search Trends Symptoms public data set.Methods We learned the causal network model using a dynamic Bayesian network, which can represent both cyclic and acyclic causal relationships, is easy to interpret and accounts for the spatio-temporal trends in the data in a probabilistically rigorous way.Results The causal network confirms a large number of cyclic relationships between the selected health conditions and the interplay between skin and mental diseases. For acne, we observe a cyclic relationship with anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and an indirect relationship with depression through sleep disorders. For dermatitis, we observe directed links to anxiety, depression and sleep disorders and a cyclic relationship with ADHD. We also observe a link between dermatitis and ADHD and a cyclic relationship between acne and ADHD. Furthermore, the network includes several direct connections between sleep disorders and other health conditions, highlighting the impact of the former on the overall health and well-being of the patient. The average R2 for a condition given the values of all conditions in the previous week is 0.67: in particular, 0.42 for acne, 0.85 for asthma, 0.58 for ADHD, 0.87 for burn, 0.76 for erectile dysfunction, 0.88 for scars, 0.57 for alcohol disorders, 0.57 for anxiety, 0.53 for depression, 0.74 for dermatitis, 0.60 for sleep disorders and 0.66 for obesity.Conclusions Mapping disease interplay, indirect relationships, and the key role of mediators, such as sleep disorders, will allow healthcare professionals to address disease management holistically and more effectively. Even if we consider all skin and mental diseases jointly, each disease subnetwork is unique, allowing for more targeted interventions."

Increasingly, large genome-sequenced cohorts are improving our ability to discover new diagnoses in the non-coding genome. Here, we identify the non-coding RNA RNU4-2 as a novel syndromic NDD gene. RNU4-2 encodes the U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), which is a critical component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex of the major spliceosome2. We identify an 18 bp region of RNU4-2 mapping to two structural elements in the U4/U6 snRNA duplex (the T-loop and Stem III) that is severely depleted of variation in the general population, but in which we identify heterozygous variants in 119 individuals with NDD. The vast majority of individuals (77.3%) have the same highly recurrent single base-pair insertion (n.64_65insT). We estimate that variants in this region explain 0.41% of individuals with NDD. We demonstrate that RNU4-2 is highly expressed in the developing human brain, in contrast to its contiguous counterpart RNU4-1 and other U4 homologs, supporting RNU4-2’s role as the primary U4 transcript in the brain. Overall, this work underscores the importance of non-coding genes in rare disorders. It will provide a diagnosis to thousands of individuals with NDD worldwide and pave the way for the development of effective treatments for these individuals."

It explored the extent of their engagement with these technologies, identifying potential impacts on their professional practices.Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted, gathering data from pathologists on their usage and views concerning AI chatbots powered by LLMs. The survey, distributed globally via various digital platforms, included both quantitative and qualitative questions. Statistical analyses were performed to delineate patterns in the adoption and perspectives on these AI tools among the respondents.Results Of 215 respondents, 100 (46.5%) reported using LLMs, particularly ChatGPT, for professional purposes, predominantly for information retrieval, proofreading, and academic writing, highlighting a significant time-saving benefit. The adoption varied across demographics, with younger, male pathologists showing higher usage rates. While the technology was mainly utilized for drafting academic materials and programming tasks, users expressed concerns about information accuracy, privacy, and the need for regulatory approval. Despite recognizing occasional inaccuracies, respondents saw potential in advanced AI features, particularly in image analysis and speech-to-text functions.Conclusions The survey underscored pathologists’ cautious yet growing interest in leveraging LLMs to enhance information accessibility, efficiency, and medical education. While the potential benefits are recognized, significant apprehensions about the reliability, ethics, and security associated with these AI tools underscore the need for comprehensive regulation and standardized practices to ensure their responsible use in the medical field."

Our study investigates the potential association between specific autoantibodies (AABs), notably those that targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) related molecules, and the diverse clinical manifestations of COVID-19, commonly observed in patients with autoimmune conditions, including rheumatic diseases, such as systemic sclerosis. In a cross-sectional analysis, we explored the relationship between AAB levels and the presence of key COVID-19 symptoms. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a robust correlation between certain AABs and symptoms such as fever, muscle ache, anosmia, and dysgeusia, which emerged as significant predictors of disease severity. Specifically, AABs against CHRM5 and CXCR3 were strongly linked to fever, while AABs against CHRM5 and BDKRB1 correlated with muscle ache. Anosmia was predominantly associated with AABs against F2R and AGTR1, while dysgeusia was linked to AABs against BDKRB1 and AGTR1. Furthermore, we observed a rise in AAB levels with the accumulation of these symptoms, with the highest levels detected in patients presenting all four predictors. Multinomial regression analysis identified AABs targeting AGTR1 as a key predictor for one or more of these core symptoms. Additionally, our study indicated that anti-AGTR1 antibodies triggered a concentration-dependent degradation of eGC, which could be mitigated by the AGTR1 antagonist Losartan. This suggests a potential mechanistic connection between eGC degradation, the observed COVID-19 symptoms, and rheumatic diseases. In conclusion, our research underscores a substantial correlation between AABs, particularly those against GPCRs and RAS-related molecules, and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. These findings open avenues for potential therapeutic interventions in the management of COVID-19."

We describe methods to overcome these limitations: key innovations are construction of scalar instruments from multiple SNPs, use of a regularized horseshoe prior, and hypothesis tests based on the marginal likelihood of the causal effect parameter. To demonstrate the approach, we constructed genotypic instruments from unlinked trans-pQTLs detected in two large GWAS studies of plasma proteins, and tested the top 20 genes for which the aggregated effects of the instruments was associated with type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank cohort. The only protein with clear evidence of a causal effect on type 2 diabetes was adiponectin, encoded by ADIPOQ: standardized log odds ratio -0.34 (95% CI -0.44 to -0.24) using UK Biobank instruments. These results have implications for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Where the exposure under study is expression of a gene, restricting the instruments to cis-acting variants is likely to miss causal effects. Tests based on the marginal likelihood should supersede other methods of testing for causality in the presence of pleiotropy."

Genomewide variation acts as a proxy marker for ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. We present an integrated approach to understand this variation by considering prevalence and mortality rates of stroke and its comorbid risk for 204 countries from 2009 to 2019, and GWAS risk variant for all these conditions. Global and regional trend analysis of rates using linear regression, correlation and proportion analysis, signify ethnogeographic differences. Interestingly, the comorbid conditions that act as risk drivers for stroke differed by regions, with more of metabolic risk in America and Europe, in contrast to high SBP in Asian and African regions. GWAS risk loci of stroke and its comorbid conditions indicate distinct population stratification for each of these conditions, signifying for population specific risk. Unique and shared genetic risk variants for stroke, and its comorbid and followed up with ethnic specific variation can help in determining regional risk drivers for stroke. Unique ethnic specific risk variants and their distinct patterns of Linkage Disequilibrium further uncover the drivers for phenotypic variation. Therefore, identifying population and comorbidity specific risk variants might help in defining the threshold for risk, and aid in developing population specific prevention strategies for stroke.Download figureOpen in new tabGraphical Abstract"

Social media, particularly Instagram, has emerged as a vital part of daily life for many, with a notable percentage of American adults engaging daily. Recognizing the impact of online platforms, this cross-sectional observational study, conducted in May 2023, delved into the nature and quality of 673 Instagram posts related to infertility. It aimed to analyze the information and support available to individuals’ navigating infertility, particularly focusing on the posts DISCERN and Global Quality Scores (GQS) to assess their reliability and quality.The findings reveal that many women derive substantial benefits from their online experiences. Instagram serves as a source of coping mechanisms for the challenges associated with infertility diagnosis and treatment. The platform allows for the sharing of personal feelings and experiences, providing a valued sense of community and support. However, it also presents a risk of spreading misinformation, underscoring the need for careful consideration of content quality.The study emphasizes the importance of accessible and reliable online resources. It suggests that healthcare professionals should play a more active role in guiding patients to trustworthy information. In conclusion, while social media offers valuable support and unique insights for individuals dealing with infertility, the quality and reliability of the information remain critical concerns. The study advocates for a more informed and conscientious use of these platforms, highlighting the potential for both support and misinformation."

We applied genomic structural equation modeling (gSEM) to genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics to evaluate the factor structure of externalizing and internalizing psychopathology across 16 traits and disorders among European-ancestry individuals (n’s = 16,400 to 1,074,629). We conducted GWAS on factors derived from well-fitting models. Downstream analyses served to identify biological mechanisms, explore drug repurposing targets, estimate genetic overlap between the externalizing and internalizing spectra, and evaluate causal effects of psychopathology liability on physical health. Both a correlated factors model, comprising two factors of externalizing and internalizing risk, and a higher-order single-factor model of genetic effects contributing to both spectra demonstrated acceptable fit. GWAS identified 409 lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with externalizing and 85 lead SNPs associated with internalizing, while the second-order GWAS identified 256 lead SNPs contributing to broad psychopathology risk. In bivariate causal mixture models, nearly all externalizing and internalizing causal variants overlapped, despite a genetic correlation of only 0.37 (SE = 0.02) between them. Externalizing genes showed cell-type specific expression in GABAergic, cortical, and hippocampal neurons, and internalizing genes were associated with reduced subcallosal cortical volume, providing insight into the neurobiological underpinnings of psychopathology. Genetic liability for externalizing, internalizing, and broad psychopathology exerted causal effects on pain, general health, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic illnesses. These findings underscore the complex genetic architecture of psychopathology, identify potential biological pathways for the externalizing and internalizing spectra, and highlight the physical health burden of psychiatric comorbidity."

The patients were presented in four different seasons; December-February as winter, March-May as autumn, June-August as summer, and September-Nov as spring, which were assessed to describe seasonal variation and compare to what are observed in other countries. SPSS version 26 was used for all the statistical assessments and analyses.Results Out of all 384 patients, 64.3% were males and 35.7% were females. The mean age was 20.8, male: female, 1.8:1. The majority of patients were in their 2nd and 3rd decades of life, and more common in the male 10–19 age group (22.1%). 23.9% of cases were observed in autumn, 22.7% in winter, 20.6% in spring, and 32.8% in summer. 10.1% increase in summer as compared to winter, 8.9% increase as compared to autumn, and 12.2% increase as compared to spring. The highest admissions were in the summer (32.8%). July had the highest number of cases (12.5%), which coincided with heavy rainy months, the rainiest days, and the lowest sunlight hours. The highest rainfall was observed in July (386mm) and August (491 mm), and the lowest sunlight hours were observed in July (6.1 hours) and August (5.9 hours), respectively. Monthly cases correlated positively with rainfall (Pearson’s R =.637, p<.05) and negatively with sunlight hours (Pearson’s R = -.618, p<.05). Complicated cases were slightly more common (50.9%), more in the 10–19 age group. Males had more complicated cases (38.3%) than females (20.8%). Complicated cases tend to present after 48 hours. The commonest postoperative complication was wound infection (5.5%). The mean length of hospital stay was 2.47 days, with no death was reported in the study period.Conclusion Peak appendicitis in summer is linked to rainfall and sunlight hours, affecting the 11-20 age groups."

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective in summarizing clinical texts, their application in echo remains underexplored. To address this, we proposed EchoGPT, a dedicated, domain specific LLM focused on echo report summarization.Methods Adult echo studies conducted at the Mayo Clinic from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017, were collected and categorized into two groups: development (all Mayo locations except Arizona) and AZ validation (Mayo Arizona) sets. We adapted open-source LLMs (Llama-2, MedAlpaca, Zephyr, and Flan-T5) using In-Context Learning (ICL) and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning for echo report summarization. The models’ performance was assessed both quantitatively with automatic metrics and qualitatively by cardiologists.Results The development dataset included 97,506 reports from 71,717 unique patients, predominantly male (55.4%), with an average age of 64.3±15.8 years. The final split contains 95,506 for training, and 1,000 each for validation and testing. EchoGPT, a QLoRA fine-tuned Llama-2 model, outperformed other LLMs with win rates ranging from 87% to 99% in various automatic metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERT Score, and RadGraph F1 Score), and produced reports comparable to cardiologists in 30 randomly selected cases for qualitative human review (significantly preferred in conciseness (p< 0.001), with no significant preference in completeness, correctness, and clinical utility).Conclusions Capable of generating echocardiography reports on par with cardiologists, EchoGPT could be used to generate draft reports for human review and approval, with significant workflow advantages.Clinical PerspectiveWhat is new?
This study is the first attempt to compare multiple open-source LLMs and different model adaptation methods in echocardiography report summarization.The resulting system, EchoGPT, can generate echo reports comparable in quality to cardiologists.Future metrics for echo report quality should emphasize factual correctness, especially on numerical measurements.What are the clinical implications?
EchoGPT system demonstrated the potential of introducing LLMs into echocardiography practice, to be used as an AI co-pilot to generate echo reports."

The first systematic approach to embrace monogenic PD worldwide, The Michael J. Fox Foundation Global Monogenic PD (MJFF GMPD) Project, contacted authors of publications reporting individuals carrying pathogenic variants in known PD-causing genes. In contrast, the Global Parkinson’s Genetics Program’s (GP2) Monogenic Network took a different approach by targeting PD centers not yet represented in the medical literature. Here, we describe combining both efforts in a “merger project” resulting in a global monogenic PD cohort with build-up of a sustainable infrastructure to identify the multi-ancestry spectrum of monogenic PD and enable studies of factors modifying penetrance and expression of monogenic PD. This effort demonstrates the value of future research based on team science approaches to generate comprehensive and globally relevant results."

This work aimed to examine the current state of automated evaluation metrics in NLG in healthcare. To have a robust and well-validated baseline with which to examine the alignment of these metrics, we created a comprehensive human evaluation framework. Employing ChatGPT-3.5-turbo generative output, we correlated human judgments with each metric. None of the metrics demonstrated high alignment; however, the SapBERT score—a Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)-showed the best results. This underscores the importance of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into evaluation efforts. Our work reveals the deficiency in quality evaluations for generated text and introduces our comprehensive human evaluation framework as a baseline. Future efforts should prioritize integrating medical knowledge databases to enhance the alignment of automated metrics, particularly focusing on refining the SapBERT score for improved assessments."

The combination of TMS and EEG constitutes a promising readout of neuronal network activity in stroke patients.Methods We used the combination of TMS and EEG to investigate the development of local signal processing and global network alterations in 40 stroke patients with motor deficits alongside neural reorganization from the acute to the chronic phase.Results We show that the TMS-EEG response reflects information about reorganization and signal alterations associated with persistent motor deficits throughout the entire post-stroke period. In the early post-stroke phase and in a subgroup of patients with severe motor deficits, TMS applied to the lesioned motor cortex evoked a sleep-like slow wave response associated with a cortical off-period, a manifestation of cortical bistability, as well as a rapid disruption of the TMS-induced formation of causal network effects. Mechanistically, these phenomena were linked to lesions affecting ascending activating brainstem fibers. Of note, slow waves invariably vanished in the chronic phase, but were highly indicative of a poor functional outcome.Conclusion In summary, we found evidence that transient effects of sleep-like slow waves and cortical bistability within ipsilesional M1 resulting in excessive inhibition may interfere with functional reorganization, leading to a less favorable functional outcome post-stroke, pointing to a new therapeutic target to improve recovery of function."

Both diffusion and T2 properties of prostate tissue inform the RSI signal, and studies have shown that each may be valuable for csPCa discrimination.Purpose To determine whether prostate T2 varies across RSI compartments and in the presence of csPCa, and to evaluate whether consideration of compartmental T2 (cT2) improves csPCa detection over RSIrs alone.Study Type Retrospective.Population Two cohorts (46 and 195 patients) scanned for csPCa.Field Strength/Sequence 3T multi-b-value DWI acquired at multiple TEs.Assessment cT2 values were computed from multi-TE RSI data and compared between RSI model compartments. csPCa detection was compared between RSIrs and a logistic regression model (LRM) for predicting the probability of csPCa using cT2 in combination with RSI measurements.Statistical Tests Two-sample t-tests (α=0.05) were used to compare cT2 values between compartments and between patients with and without csPCa. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate csPCa detection performance.Results In both cohorts, T2 differed (p<0.05) across all RSI compartments (C1, C2, C3, C4). Voxel-level data from cohort 1 showed that T2 differed between normal and cancerous tissue in C1, C2, C3 (p<0.001). Whole-prostate T2 differed between patients with and without csPCa in C3 (p=0.02). In cohort 2, whole-prostate T2 differed in C1 (p=0.01), C3 (p=0.01), and C4 (p<0.01). Consideration of cT2 improved csPCa discrimination compared to diffusion alone, but not compared to RSIrs [cohort 1: 0.80 vs 0.70 (diffusion) and 0.80 (RSIrs), cohort 2: 0.72 vs 0.65 (diffusion) and 0.72 (RSIrs)].Data Conclusion Significant differences in cT2 were observed between normal and cancerous prostatic tissue. With our data, however, consideration of cT2 did not significantly improve cancer detection performance over RSIrs alone."

Recent studies, however, have indicated that the impact of the contralesional hemisphere exhibits region-specific variability with concurrently existing maladaptive and supportive influences exerted by distinct contralesional regions. These findings challenge the concept of structural reserve’s uniform deduction of the contralesional relevance and call for a more differentiated investigation of the interactions between contralesional motor regions and ipsilesional network structures.We here explored the relationship between the behavioral role of key areas of the contralesional motor system and lesion-induced connectome disruption early after stroke. Accordingly, we analyzed online TMS interference data of twenty-five stroke patients pooled from two previous studies to disentangle interindividual differences in the functional roles of contralesional primary motor cortex (M1), contralesional dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), and contralesional anterior interparietal sulcus (aIPS) for motor function early after stroke. Connectome-based lesion symptom mapping (CLSM) as well as lesion quantification of the corticospinal tract (CST) were used to investigate how rTMS effects depend on structural network properties of the ipsilesional hemisphere, i.e., the structural reserve.At group and individual levels, online TMS interference with contralesional M1 and aIPS but not dPMC led to improved motor performance early after stroke, indicating a detrimental influence of both regions. Performance improvement following M1 interference was positively linked to ipsilesional CST lesion load, indicating a more detrimental influence of contralesional M1 on motor function early after stroke the higher the CST lesion load.At the connectome level, a more disturbing role of contralesional M1 was related to a more severe disruption of the structural integrity of ipsilesional M1 in the affected motor network. In stark contrast, a detrimental influence of contralesional aIPS was particularly found in case of less disruption of the ipsilesional M1 connectivity.In summary, our findings indicate that contralesional areas distinctively interfere with motor performance early after stroke depending on ipsilesional structural integrity, extending the concept of structural reserve to regional specificity in recovery of function following brain lesions."

AbstractGiven changes in technology, regulatory guidance, and COVID-19, there has been an explosion in the number of online studies in the social and clinical sciences. This, in turn, has led to a need for brief and accessible instruments that are designed and characterized with self-administered, online research in mind. To fulfill this need, the Brief Attention and Mood Scale of 7 Items (BAMS-7) was developed and validated in five cohorts and four experiments to assess real-world attention and mood. In Experiment 1, an exploratory factor analysis was run on data from a large, healthy, adult sample (N=75,019, ages 18-89 years). Two subscales were defined and further characterized: one for Attention, the other for Mood. In Experiment 2, convergent validity (concordance) with existing questionnaires was established in a separate sample (N=150). Experiment 3 used a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to demonstrate known-groups validity of the Attention and Mood subscales using a large sample (N=58,411) of participants reporting a lifetime diagnosis of ADHD, anxiety, or depression, as well as the healthy sample from Experiment 1. Experiment 3 also showed that the BAMS-7 Attention subscale provided superior classification performance for ADHD, and the Mood subscale provided superior classification for anxiety and depression. Finally, Experiment 4 applied the BAMS-7 definition to reanalyze data (N=3,489) from a previously published cognitive training study (Hardy et al., 2015), finding that the Attention and Mood subscales were sensitive to the intervention (compared to an active control) to different degrees. In sum, the elucidated psychometric properties and large normative dataset (N=75,019) for BAMS-7 may make it a useful instrument for assessing real-world attention and mood."

Phase 1 resulted in the generation of 60 items. Following phases 2 to 3, these items were developed into self-completion, and assisted self-completion tools for children aged 9 years and older, and those aged under 9 years respectively, and a proxy score, for completion by parents and carers. Correlations scores between individual item and whole domain scoring were above 0.58 for the self-completion tools and above 0.39 for the proxy completion tool. Initial Cronbach’s alpha for the tool overall was good at 0.84, with within-domain alphas of 0.81 – 0.87.In conclusion, these instruments demonstrate the feasibility of capturing ocular sensations in children and young people, with a patient centred development approach resulting in tools with high rates of completion, and acceptable internal instrument consistency."

To clarify this relation, we analysed data from 432 subjects from the PPMI (Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative) database, a second cohort of 57 PD patients and controls and a third cohort of 86 subjects referred for dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DaT-SPECT). Caudate, but not putamen binding potential (CBP, PBP) was higher in patients with RT. The presence of a higher CBP at the baseline and a relative sparing of CBP were related to the development of RT in the 2nd year. In the smaller cohorts, a 4-6 Hz oscillation-based metric extracted from inertial sensors correlated with RT amplitude and distinguished groups with DA denervation from controls. The same metric was correlated with CBP, but not PBP in subjects with a denervated DaT-SPECT. In silico modelling uncovered that higher CBP in patients with RT was fundamental to explain the associations and correlations between RT and DaT-SPECT described in our and other datasets. These results support that the integrity of caudate dopaminergic terminals could be relevant for RT pathophysiology. Unbiased assessment methods, such as inertial sensors, can be important to understand PD pathophysiology."

However, data from real-world randomized trials are lacking.We conducted a cluster randomized, open-label trial in Tanzania evaluating the use of a digital clinical decision support algorithm (CDSA), enhanced by point-of-care tests, training and mentorship, compared with usual care, among sick children 2 to 59 months old presenting to primary care facilities for an acute illness in Tanzania (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05144763). The primary outcome was the mean proportion of 14 major Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) symptoms and signs assessed by clinicians. Secondary outcomes included antibiotic prescription, counselling provided, and the appropriateness of antimalarial and antibiotic prescriptions.A total of 450 consultations were observed in 9 intervention and 9 control health facilities. The mean proportion of major symptoms and signs assessed in intervention health facilities was 46.4% (range 7.7% to 91.7%) compared to 26.3% (range 0% to 66.7%) in control health facilities, an adjusted difference of 15.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.8% to 25.4%). Only weight, height, and pallor were assessed more often when using the digital CDSA than in controls. Observed antibiotic prescription was 37.3% in intervention facilities, and 76.4% in control facilities (adjusted risk ratio 0.5; 95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p<0.001). Appropriate antibiotic prescription was 81.9% in intervention facilities and 51.4% in control facilities (adjusted risk ratio 1.5; 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8; p=0.003).The implementation of a digital CDSA improved only slightly the mean proportion of IMCI symptoms and signs assessed in consultations with sick children, and most symptoms and signs were assessed infrequently. Nonetheless, antibiotics were prescribed less often, and more appropriately Innovative approaches to overcome barriers related to clinicians’ motivation and work environment are needed."

In 2018, Uganda established Kawempe National Referral hospital (KRNH) as the highest level of care for maternity services. There is a dearth of data examining if the referral function for which it was established has been met. The objectives of this study were two fold; i) to assess the appropriateness of in-coming referrals at KRNH ii) to examine factors underpinning referral decisions at lower referring facilities across Uganda.Methods This was a two-phased, mixed-methods study involving 76 health facilities across Uganda. In Phase One, we conducted a cross-sectional study examining incoming referrals at KNRH between July 2019 and August 2020 based on routinely collected data in the Health Information System (HMIS) in-patient registers. In Phase Two, we qualitatively explored factors underpinning maternity referrals at 75 purposively selected facilities. Descriptive statistics were managed in STATA (v14) while qualitative data were analyzed by thematic approach.Results A total of 461,226 referrals were made to KNRH during the period under review. The three most common indications for referral at KNRH were; previous caesarian scar, premature rupture of membranes and obstructed labour. Facilities mandated to offer comprehensive emergency obstetric care such as general hospitals (84%) and sub-district hospitals or Health Centre IVs (18%) were the two leading sources of referrals at KNRH. Shortage of basic commodities, poorly equipped theatres, deficiencies in skills for labour, study leaves for maternity workforce at lower facilities contributed to unnecessary referrals.Conclusion Several of the indications of referrals at KNRH are ideally manageable at lower referring facilities such as district and sub-district hospitals levels suggesting deficiencies in the national obstetric referral system. Interventions for strengthening basic clinical skills in the management of labour at lower referring facilities and addressing underpinning health system constraints is recommended."

However, if a treatment is non-inferior to another treatment in terms of overall survival, clinicians may be interested in further exploring which treatment results in better health utility scores for patients. Examining health utility in a secondary analysis is feasible, however, since health utility is not the primary endpoint, it is usually not considered in the sample size calculation, hence the power to detect a difference of health utility is not guaranteed. Furthermore, often the premise of non-inferiority trials is to test the assumption that an intervention provides superior quality of life or toxicity profile without compromising the survival when compared to the existing standard. Based on this consideration, it may be beneficial to consider both survival and utility when designing a trial. There have been methods that can combine survival and quality of life into a single measure, but they either have strong restrictions or lack theoretical frameworks. In this manuscript, we propose a method called HUS (Health Utility adjusted Survival), which can combine survival outcome and longitudinal utility measures for treatment comparison. We propose an innovative statistical framework as well as procedures to conduct power analysis and sample size calculation. By comprehensive simulation studies involving summary statistics from the PET-NECK trial,1 we demonstrate that our new approach can achieve superior power performance using relatively small sample sizes, and our composite endpoint can be considered as an alternative to overall survival in future clinical trial design and analysis where both survival and health utility are of interest."

While UTIs are primarily caused by Escherichia coli colonizing the patient’s gut, it is unclear whether the gut resident E. coli profiles can predict the person’s risks for UTI and optimal antimicrobial treatments. Thus, we conducted an eighteen-month long community-based observational study of fecal E. coli colonization and UTI in women aged 50 years and above.Methods and Findings We enrolled a total of 1,804 women distributed among age groups 50-59 yo (437 participants), 60-69 yo (632), 70-79 yo (532), and above 80 yo (203), lacking antibiotic prescriptions for at least one year. The provided fecal samples were plated for the presence of E. coli and other enterobacteria resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/STX), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and 3rd generation cephalosporins (3GC). E. coli was also characterized as belonging to the pandemic multi-drug resistant clonal groups ST131 (subclone H30) and ST1193. Following sample collection, the women were monitored for 18 months for occurrence of UTI.E. coli was cultured from 90.8% fecal samples, with 24.1% containing bacteria resistant to TMP/STX, 19.4% to CIP, and 7.9% to 3GC. In 62.5% samples, only all-susceptible E. coli were present. Overall, there were no age-related differences in resistance prevalence. However, while the total E. coli H30 and ST1193 carriage rates were similar (4.3% and 4.2%, respectively), there was a notable increase of H30 carriage with age (P = .001), while carriage decreased with age for ST1193 (P = .057).Within 18 months, 184 women (10.2%) experienced at least one episode of UTI - 10.9% among the gut E. coli carriers and 3.0% among the non-carriers (P=.0013). The UTI risk among carriers of E. coli H30 but not ST1193 was significantly above average (24.3%, P = .0004). The UTI probability increased with age, occurring in 6.4% of 50-59 yo and 19.7% of 80+ yo (P<.001), with the latter group being especially at high risk for UTI, if they were colonized by E. coli H30 (40.0%, P<.001).E. coli was identified in 88.1% of urine samples, with 16.1% resistant to TMP/STX, 16.1% to CIP, 4.2% to 3GC and 73.1% to none of the antibiotics. Among tested urinary E. coli resistant to antibiotics, 86.1% matched the resistance profile of E. coli in the fecal samples, with the clonotyping and whole genome sequencing confirming the matching strains’ identity. Positive predictive value (PPV) of using gut resistance profiles to predict UTI pathogens’ susceptibility to TMP/STX, CIP, 3GC and all three antibiotics were 98.4%, 98.3%, 96.6% and 95.3%, respectively. Corresponding negative predictive values (NPV) were 63.0%, 54.8%, 44.4% and 75.8%, respectively. The AUC ROC curve values for the accuracy of fecal diagnostic testing for the prediction of UTI resistance ranged .86-.89. The fecal test-guided drug-bug mismatch rate for empirical (pre-culture) prescription of TMP-SXT or CIP is reduced to ≤2% in 89.6% of patients and 94.8% of patients with an optional 3GC prescription.Conclusion The resistance profile and clonal identity of gut colonizing E. coli, along with the carrier’s age, can inform personalized prediction of a patients’ UTI risk and the UTI pathogen’s antibiotic susceptibility within an 18-month period."

This cohort provides valuable data for researchers and policymakers working on diabetes management and public health strategies.Participants Diabetes was defined as having inpatient or outpatient encounters with diagnosis of diabetes ICD-9/10 codes, any use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs, or one encounter with hemoglobin A1C > 4.8mmol/mol or 6.5%. Patients with diabetes have been continuously enrolled from hospitals and primary cares in Nanjing since 2020. Demographic, medications, and comorbidities data were extracted using clinical notes, diagnostic codes, labs, medications, and vital signs among different types of diabetes.Findings to date The NDC consisted of 1033904 patients from Jan 1st, 2020 to Dec 31th, 2022, the most part of whom were male (50.62%) and from district Gulou (30.79%). The clinical characteristics and medications usage of patients with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes and other diabetes were assessed. The prevalence of hypertension, heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease were 31.20%, 21.46%, and 13.74% respectively.Future plans NDC will enroll eligible patients continuously each year.

This study aimed to assess intracranial aneurysm stiffness using four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D flow MRI).Methods A total of 27 aneurysms in 25 patients with internal carotid artery aneurysms were included. Using 4D flow MRI, we measured the arterial pulse waveform during a cardiac cycle at planes proximal and distal to the target aneurysm. The damping of these waveforms through the aneurysm was defined as the aneurysm damping index (ADI) and compared with that of the contralateral side. Additionally, we investigated the clinical factors associated with the ADI.Results ADI assessment was successful in all cases. The obtained ADI was 1.18 ± 0.28 (mean ± standard deviation), significantly larger than 1.0 (P=0.0027 [t-test]). The ADI on the aneurysm side was larger than on the contralateral side (1.19 ± 0.30 vs 1.05 ± 0.17, P=0.029 [t-test]). On multivariate analysis, the use of beta-blockers (β=0.46, P=0.015) and smoking history (β=-0.22, P=0.024) showed a significant correlation with ADI.Conclusions We proposed a novel method to assess the stiffness of intracranial aneurysms using 4D flow MRI. The quantitative observation of the damping of arterial pulse waves revealed a correlation between ADI and clinical factors, such as the use of antihypertensive drugs and smoking. Further studies should focus on evaluating the aneurysm stiffness and its clinical applications."

To further unravel the underlying genetic mechanisms, we performed multi-trait association analysis to identify novel or pleiotropic genomic risk loci, and shared causal variants for diseases involving BL. Using multiple post-GWAS methods, we explored potential genes, pathways, tissues, cells, and therapeutic targets associated with diseases from different perspectives.Findings We found extensive global and local genetic correlations between MDD, MI and the traits of BL. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses showed that lipid metabolism mediated 26.5% of the mediating effect of MDD leading to MI. Multi-trait association analysis successfully identified 13 MDD- and 36 MI- novel risk loci which have never been reported before. Notably, many pleiotropic loci and shared causal variants were identified across risk loci for both diseases, such as 11q23.3 (rs117937125) and 12q13.3 (rs188571756), which also colocalized for traits of BL. Pathway enrichment analysis further highlighted shared biological pathways primarily involving synaptic function, arterial development, and lipid metabolism. Lastly, gene-mapping, gene-based, transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association, and MR-proteomic analyses revealed candidate pathogenic genes and therapeutic targets (such as ANGPTL4 and TMEM106B).Interpretation These findings not only provide novel insights into the role of BL in the comorbidity between MDD and MI, but also benefit the development of preventive or therapeutic drugs for diseases."

However, to our knowledge, no systematic attempts have yet been made to define and specify aims for chronic care quality.Objective We conducted a scoping review and Delphi survey to establish and validate a comprehensive specification of chronic care quality aims.Methodology The Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) quality of care definition and aims was utilised as our base. We purposively selected scientific and grey literature that have acknowledged and unpacked the plurality of quality in chronic care and which proposed/made use of frameworks and studied their implementation or investigated minimum two IOM care quality aims and their implementation. We critically analysed the literature deductively and inductively. We validated our findings through Delphi survey involving international chronic care experts, mostly coming from/have expertise on low-and-middle-income countries.Results We considered the natural history of chronic conditions and the journey of a person with chronic condition to define and identify aims of chronic care quality. We noted that the six IOM aims apply but with additional meanings. We identified a seventh aim, continuity, which relates well to the issue of chronicity. Our panellists agreed with the specifications. Several provided contextualised interpretations and concrete examples.Conclusions Chronic conditions pose specific challenges underscoring the relevance of tailoring quality of care aims. Operationalization of this tailored definition and specified aims to improve, measure and assure quality of chronic care can be next steps."

With over 9 published definitions and at least 16 diagnostic/staging systems, the true incidence and severity of ORNJ are obscured by lack of a standard for disease definition and severity assessment, leading to inaccurate estimation of incidence, reporting ambiguity, and likely under-diagnosis worldwide. This study aimed to achieve consensus on an explicit definition and phenotype of ORNJ and related precursor states through data standardization to facilitate effective diagnosis, monitoring, and multidisciplinary management of ORNJ.Methods The ORAL Consortium comprised 69 international experts, including representatives from medical, surgical, radiation oncology, and oral/dental disciplines. Using a web-based modified Delphi technique, panelists classified descriptive cases using existing staging systems, reviewed systems for feature extraction and specification, and iteratively classified cases based on clinical/imaging feature combinations.Results The Consortium ORNJ definition was developed in alignment with SNOMED-CT terminology and recent ISOO-MASCC-ASCO guideline recommendations. Case review using existing ORNJ staging systems showed high rates of inability to classify (up to 76%). Ten consensus statements and nine minimum data elements (MDEs) were outlined for prospective collection and classification of precursor/ORNJ stages.Conclusion This study provides an international, consensus-based definition and MDE foundation for standardized ORNJ reporting in cancer survivors treated with RT. Head and neck surgeons, radiation, surgical, medical oncologists, and dental specialists should adopt MDEs to enable scalable health information exchange and analytics. Work is underway to develop both a human- and machine-readable knowledge representation for ORNJ (i.e., ontology) and multidisciplinary resources for dissemination to improve ORNJ reporting in academic and community practice settings."

There is however, limited knowledge about the longitudinal course of this relationship.Methods Systemic inflammation (C-Reactive Protein, CRP) and cognition (nine cognitive domains) was measured from baseline to 1 year follow-up in first treatment SZ and BD (n=221), and healthy controls (HC, n=220). Linear mixed models were used to evaluate longitudinal changes separately in CRP and cognitive domains specific to diagnostic status (SZ, BD, HC). Hierarchical clustering was applied on the entire sample to investigate the longitudinal course of transdiagnostic inflammatory-cognitive subgroups.Results There were no case-control differences or change in CRP from baseline to follow-up. We confirm previous observations of case-control differences in cognition at both time-points and domain specific stability/improvement over time regardless of diagnostic status. We identified transdiagnostic inflammatory-cognitive subgroups at baseline with differing demographics and clinical severity. Despite improvement in cognition, symptoms and functioning, the higher inflammation – lower cognition subgroup (75% SZ; 48% BD; 38% HC) had sustained inflammation and lower cognition, more symptoms, and lower functioning (SMI only) at follow-up. This was in comparison to a lower inflammation – higher cognition subgroup (25% SZ, 52% BD, 62% HC), where SMI participants showed cognitive functioning at HC level with a positive clinical course.Conclusions Our findings support heterogenous and transdiagnostic inflammatory-cognitive subgroups that are stable over time, and may benefit from targeted interventions."

This study investigates the prescribing trends of initial antihypertensive treatments in South Korea, focusing on the shift towards combination therapies, especially fixed-dose combinations, as recommended by current guidelines.Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from 59,950 treatment-naïve hypertension patients without significant comorbidities from the National Patient Sample of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, spanning 2009 to 2020. The study examined the prevalence of monotherapy versus combination therapy and the preferred classes of antihypertensive drugs.Results Among the cohort, 55.7% received monotherapy, and 44.3% were initiated on combination therapy. There was a notable increase in the prescription of fixed-dose combinations from 73.8% in 2009 to 93.8% in 2020. ARBs and CCBs were the predominant choices, with a preference for ARBs over ACE inhibitors, possibly due to the lower risk of side effects such as cough. The trend towards fixed-dose combinations aligns with guidelines advocating for improved patient adherence and efficacy.Conclusions The evolving prescription trends in South Korea towards combination therapy, particularly fixed-dose combinations, reflect a commitment to aligning with international hypertension management guidelines. This adaptation underscores the importance of evidence-based practice in enhancing hypertension care."

The aim of this study was to identify disease processes in MLTC associated with increased susceptibility to organ injury post-surgery.Methods Unsupervised machine learning methods were applied to pre-surgery biomarkers of haematological, cardiac, liver, and renal disease from four intensively phenotyped cardiac surgery cohorts. The resulting MLTC clusters were then matched to a fifth cohort where single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) was performed on atrial biopsies collected at surgery.Results K-means clustering identified two MLTC clusters. Cluster 1 had lower rates of chronic kidney disease and anaemia and increased immune system activation pre-surgery. Cluster 2 had more severe cardiorenal disease, anaemia, and elevated biomarkers of immunological ageing pre-surgery. Cluster 2 had significantly higher rates of organ injury relative to Cluster 1. The results were consistent across internal and external validation analyses.Analysis of snRNAseq data in biopsies from Cluster 1 demonstrated enrichment for immune response genes in cardiomyocytes, naive T/B lymphocytes and progenitor cells, and activation of non-tissue resident macrophages relative to Cluster 2. Cluster 2 showed enrichment for senescent/ effector memory T cells, dysregulated activation of tissue-resident macrophages, and cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation relative to Cluster 1.In UK Biobank, genetic modification of genes differentially expressed between the two MLTC phenotypes altered 90-day mortality post-surgery.Conclusions Immune system homeostasis determines susceptibility to organ injury and death in people with MLTC undergoing cardiac surgery and represents a previously unrecognised target for organ protection interventions."

However, the test itself is expensive and can take a long time to process. In contrast, microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue is inexpensive, fast, and integrated into the standard of care. This work explores the possibility of predicting ESR1 gene expression from H&E images, and its use in predicting clinical variables and patient outcomes. We utilized a weakly supervised method to train a deep learning model to predict ESR1 expression from whole slide images, and achieved 0.57 [95% CI: 0.46, 0.67] Pearson’s correlation with the ground truth value. Our ESR1 expression prediction achieved an AUROC of 0.81 [0.74, 0.87] in predicting clinical ER status obtained using an immunohistochemistry staining technique, and a c-index of 0.59 [0.52, 0.65] in predicting progression-free interval for the patients in our cohort. This work further demonstrates the potential to infer gene expression from H&E stained images in a manner that shows meaningful associations with clinical variables. Because obtaining H&E stained images is substantially easier and faster than genetic testing, the capability to derive molecular genetic information from these images may increase access to this type of information for patient risk stratification and provide research insights into molecular-morphological associations."

We aim to construct a hierarchical artificial intelligence-based multimodal non-invasive method for pre-endoscopic risk screening, to provide tailored recommendations for endoscopy.Design From December 2022 to December 2023, a large-scale screening study was conducted in Fujian, China. Based on traditional Chinese medicine theory, we simultaneously collected tongue images and inquiry information from 1034 participants, considering the potential of these data for PLGC screening. Then, we introduced inquiry information for the first time, forming a multimodality artificial intelligence model to integrate tongue images and inquiry information for pre-endoscopic screening. Moreover, we validated this approach in another independent external validation cohort, comprising 143 participants from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital.Results A multimodality artificial intelligence-assisted pre-endoscopic screening model based on tongue images and inquiry information (AITonguequiry) was constructed, adopting a hierarchical prediction strategy, achieving tailored endoscopic recommendations. Validation analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) values of AITonguequiry were 0.74 for PLGC (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.76, p < 0.05) and 0.82 for high-risk PLGC (95% CI 0.82 to 0.83, p < 0.05), which were significantly and robustly better than those of the independent use of either tongue images or inquiry information alone, and also demonstrated superior performance compared to existing screening methodologies. In the independent external verification, the AUC values were 0.69 for PLGC and 0.76 for high-risk PLGC.Conclusion Our AITonguequiry artificial intelligence model, for the first time, incorporates inquiry information and tongue images, leading to a higher precision and finer-grained pre-endoscopic screening of PLGC. This enhances patient screening efficiency and alleviates patient burden."

Delay data between events, such as infection and symptom onset times, is doubly censored because the exact time at which these key events occur is generally unknown. Current mathematical models for delay distributions rely solely on heuristic justifications for their applicability. Here, we derive a new model for delay distributions, specifically for incubation periods, motivated by bacterial-growth dynamics that lead to the Burr family of distributions being a valid modelling choice. We also incorporate methods within these models to account for the doubly censored data. Our approach provides biological justification in the derivation of our delay distribution model, the results of fitting to data highlighting the superiority of the Burr model compared to currently used models in the literature. Our results indicate that the derived Burr distribution is 13 times more likely to be a better-performing model to incubation-period data than currently used methods. Further, we show that incorporating methods for handling the censoring issue results in the mean of the underlying continuous incubation-period model being reduced by a whole day, compared to the mean obtained under alternative modelling techniques in the literature.Author summary In public health, it is important to know key temporal properties of diseases (such as how long someone is ill for or infectious for). Mathematical characterisation of properties requires information about patients’ infection histories, such as the number of days between infection and symptom onset, for example. These methods provide useful insights, such as how their infectiousness varies over time since they were infected. However, two key issues arise with these approaches. First, these methods do not have strong arguments for the validity of their usage. Second, the data typically used is provided as a rounded number of days between key events, as opposed to the exact period of time. We address both these issues by developing a new mathematical model to describe the important properties of the infection process of various diseases based on strong biological justification, and further incorporating methods within the mathematical model which consider infection and symptom onset to occur at any point within an interval, as opposed to an exact time. Our approach provides more preferable results, based on AIC, than existing approaches, enhancing the understanding of properties of diseases such as Legionnaires’ disease."

CRTs rely on well-defined sample size estimations to detect statistically significant effects of trialled interventions; however these are often predicted poorly by investigators. Here, we review the accuracy of predicted parameters used in sample size calculations for malaria CRTs with epidemiological outcomes.Methods We searched for published malaria CRTs using four online databases in March 2022. Eligible trials included those with malaria-specific epidemiological outcomes which randomised at least six geographical clusters to study arms. Predicted and observed sample size parameters were extracted by reviewers for each trial. Pair-wise correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the accuracy of predicted control-arm outcome estimates and desired relative reductions (effect sizes) between arms compared to what was observed. Among trials which retrospectively calculated an estimate of heterogeneity in cluster outcomes, we recalculated study power according to observed trial estimates.Results Of the 1889 records identified and screened, 108 articles were eligible and comprised of 71 malaria CRTs. Among trials that included sample size calculations (91.5%, 65/71), most estimated cluster heterogeneity using the coefficient of variation (k) (80%, 52/65) which were often predicted without using prior data (67.7%, 44/65). Predicted control-arm epidemiological outcomes correlated weakly with those observed, with 61.2% (19/31) of prevalence estimates overestimated. Among the minority of trials which retrospectively calculated cluster heterogeneity (20%, 13/65), empirical values contrasted with those used in sample size estimations and often compromised study power. Observed effect sizes were often smaller than had been predicted at the sample size stage (72.9%, 51/70) and were typically higher in the first, compared to the second, year of trials. Overall, effect sizes achieved by malaria interventions tested in trials decreased between 1995 and 2021.Conclusions Study findings reveal sample size parameters in malaria CRTs were often inaccurate and resulted in underpowered studies. Future trials must strive to obtain more representative epidemiological sample size inputs to ensure interventions against malaria are adequately evaluated.Registration This review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022315741)."

We aimed to estimate the impact of ethnicity on stroke risk in patients with hypertension, diabetes or hypercholesterolaemia.Methods Multistate models were constructed using electronic health records including date at onset of stroke, stroke risk factors, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation in adult patients of Asian, Black, or White ethnicity, registered in 41 general practices in south London between 2005 and 2021. Transitions to hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolaemia (transition 1) and from these risk factors to stroke (transitions 2) were considered.Results Of the 849,968 registered patients, 651,888 (76·7%) were of Asian (8·6%), Black (18·2%), or White (73·2%) ethnicity and 54·1% were female. Patients of Black ethnicity had higher incidence of stroke (2·1%) and cardiometabolic risk factors, whereas patients of Asian and White ethnicity had intermediate and lower levels of stroke (1·2% and 1·0% respectively) and cardiometabolic risk factors. Asian and Black ethnicities were associated with higher risks in transition 1 compared to White ethnicity. Ethnicity did not alter transition 2, except for hypercholesterolaemia, Black ethnicity being associated with higher risk of stroke compared to Asian and White ethnicity.Conclusion Our results confirm that Black ethnicity does not confer excess stroke risk in patients with hypertension or diabetes. This observation was also made for Asian ethnicity. Black ethnicity was associated with increased stroke risk only in patients with Hypercholesterolaemia.Funding Guys and St Thomas grant (EIC180702)."

All participants were randomly assigned to two experimental groups (TRL, low-intensity treadmill running and TRH, high-intensity treadmill running). All participants performed a single treadmill running session at different intensities based on their target heart rate (THR). A running assessment was administered to every participant one week before implementing the exercise interventions. The magnitudes of EIH, conditioned pain modulation (CPM), and temporal summation (TS) responses following long-term treadmill running were assessed. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) or mechanical pain thresholds (MPT) were also determined following long-term treadmill running.Results Treadmill running only induced acute EIH responses, with all pre-running PPT and MPT remaining unaltered. However, EIH responses were significantly positively and negatively correlated with running sessions in the TRL and TRH groups, respectively.Conclusions A 4-week low-intensity treadmill running improved acute EIH response by enhancing endogenous pain modulation in healthy females. Future studies should consider sex, behavior, and physiological factors to provide a comprehensive understanding of the changes in EIH following long-term exercises."

To identify reliable pre-therapy predictors of complete response to first-line therapy (CR1) and outcomes, we assembled a cohort of 238 individuals with TP53-mutated myeloid neoplasms and ≥ 10% blasts with well-annotated clinical, molecular and pathology data. Key outcomes examined were CR1 & 24-month survival (OS24). In this elderly cohort (median age 68.1 years) with 74.0% receiving frontline non-intensive regimens (hypomethylating agents+/-venetoclax), the overall cohort CR1 rate was 26.4% (51/193). We additionally identified several pre-therapy factors predictive of inferior CR1 including male gender (P = .015), ≥ 2 autosomal monosomies (P < .001), -17/17p (P = .015), multi-hit TP53 allelic state (P < .001) and CUX1 co-alterations (P = .011). In univariable analysis of the entire cohort, inferior OS24 was predicated by ≥ 2 monosomies (P = .004), TP53 VAF>25% (P < .001), TP53 splice junction mutations (P = .008) and antecedent treated myeloid neoplasm (P = .001). In addition, mutations/deletions in CUX1, U2AF1, EZH2, TET2, CBL, or KRAS (’EPI6’ signature) predicted inferior OS24 (HR = 2.0 [1.4–2.7]; P < .0001). In a subgroup analysis of HMA +/-Ven treated individuals (N = 141), TP53 VAF and monosomies did not impact OS24. A risk score for HMA +/-Ven treated individuals incorporating three pre-therapy predictors including TP53 splice junction mutations, EPI6 and antecedent treated myeloid neoplasm stratified 3 prognostic distinct groups: intermediate, intermediate-poor, and poor with significantly different median (12.6, 6.3, 4.3 months) and 24-month (19.3%, 5.2%, 0.5%) survival (P < .001). For the first time, in a seemingly monolithic high-risk cohort, our data identifies several baseline factors that predict response and 24-month survival.Key Points≥2 monosomies, multi-hit TP53 allelic state & CUX1 deletions are associated with poor frontline response in TP53-mutated myeloid neoplasm.TP53 splice junction mutations and co-alterations in any one of six genes (CBL, CUX1, EZH2, KRAS, TET2 & U2AF1) adversely impact 24-month survival."

This paper outlines the methodology used in the development of clinical management pathways for PSM.Methods Building upon the Chicago Consensus Guidelines, a multidisciplinary North American panel was surveyed using a Modified Delphi technique to gauge the levels of agreement with clinical management pathways. Rapid systematic reviews were undertaken to address contentious questions specific to disease sites, which were structured using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome framework.Results Two consecutive rounds of voting were conducted between June 2023 and February 2024, addressing nine pathways spanning various conditions associated with PSM (colorectal, appendiceal, gastric, and neuroendocrine neoplasms, peritoneal mesothelioma, and gastrointestinal obstruction). The first Delphi consensus round involved 228 participants, of which 198 (87%) responded in the second round. Over 90% consensus was achieved in most blocks across all pathways. Eleven rapid systematic reviews were conducted, including 183 studies cumulatively out of 13,595 abstracts screened through PubMed. Perspectives from patient advocates and international experts were incorporated into these guidelines. The consortium’s multilevel approach also involved the creation of a peritoneal oncology curriculum, recommendations for billing and coding, and shared resources for perioperative care and patient information.Conclusion Experts indicated high levels of agreement with most pathway blocks across disease sites. These guidelines do not replace the need for high-level evidence but serve as guiding principles for critical decisions within the current landscape of PSM care."

The N protein is evolutionary conservative and is abundantly expressed on the surface of infected cells, allowing anti-N immune response generated by Convacell® to rapidly clear infected cells and provide long-lasting protection against COVID-19. Convacell® has been demonstrated to be safe and highly immunogenic, creating immune responses lasting over a year, in phase I/II and IIb clinical trials. Phase IIb clinical trial has also demonstrated that a single dose vaccination regimen with Convacell® is sufficient to provide an immune response.Here we report the finding of the phase III clinical trial of Convacell®. Two groups of volunteers from Russia have been either vaccinated with a single dose of Convacell® or injected with placebo, and then monitored for incidence of COVID-19 and adverse effects. Anti-N antibody titers at admission were also analyzed, to take into account for potential effects of previous virus encounters.Disease incidence over 6 months results indicate an overall vaccine efficacy of 85.2% (95% confidence interval: 67.4-93.3%). Additionally, Convacell® has shown a good safety profile. Overall, Convacell® demonstrated highly desirable qualities and good performance as a vaccine and can be considered as valuable COVID-19 preventative measure."

There has been substantial progress in identifying genetic variants underlying AUD. However, there are few whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies of AUD. We analyzed WES of 4,530 samples from the Yale-Penn cohort and 469,835 samples from the UK Biobank (UKB). After quality control, 1,420 AUD cases and 619 controls of European ancestry (EUR) and 1,142 cases and 608 controls of African ancestry (AFR) from Yale-Penn were retained for subsequent analyses. WES data from 415,617 EUR samples (12,861 cases), 6,142 AFR samples (130 cases) and 4,607 South Asian (SAS) samples (130 cases) from UKB were also analyzed. Single-variant association analysis identified the well-known functional variant rs1229984 in ADH1B (P=4.88×10-31) and several other common variants in ADH1C. Gene-based tests identified ADH1B (P=1.00×10-31), ADH1C (P=5.23×10-7), CNST (P=1.19×10-6), and IFIT5 (3.74×10-6). This study extends our understanding of the genetic basis of AUD."

The present study examined relations between inpatient STS and neurodevelopmental scores measured at 12 months in a sample of very preterm (VPT) infants.Study Design and Methods From a retrospective study review of medical records of 181 VPT infants (<32 weeks gestational age (GA)) we derived the STS rate, i.e., the total minutes of STS each infant received/day of hospital stay. We used scores on the Capute Scales from routine follow-up care at 12 months as the measure of neurodevelopmental outcome (n=181).Results Families averaged approximately 17 minutes/day of STS care (2 days/week, 70 minutes/session), although there was substantial variability. Variation in STS rate was positively associated with outcomes at 12 months corrected age (r = 0.25, p < .001). STS rate significantly predicted 6.2% unique variance in 12-month neurodevelopmental outcomes, after controlling for GA, socioeconomic status (SES), health acuity, and visitation frequency. A 20-minute increase in STS per day was associated with a 10-point increase (.67 SDs) in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 months. SES, GA, and infant health acuity did not moderate these relations.Conclusion VPT infants who experienced more STS during hospitalization demonstrated higher scores on 12-month assessments of neurodevelopment. Results provide evidence that STS care may confer extended neuroprotection on VPT infants through the first year of life."

Neuronavigation augments the surgeon’s ability to achieve this but loses validity as surgery progresses due to brain shift. Moreover, gliomas are often indistinguishable from surrounding healthy brain tissue. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) and ultrasound (iUS) help visualize the tumor and brain shift. iUS is faster and easier to incorporate into surgical workflows but offers a lower contrast between tumorous and healthy tissues than iMRI. With the success of data-hungry Artificial Intelligence algorithms in medical image analysis, the benefits of sharing well-curated data cannot be overstated. To this end, we provide the largest publicly available MRI and iUS database of surgically treated brain tumors, including gliomas (n=92), metastases (n=11), and others (n=11). This collection contains 369 preoperative MRI series, 320 3D iUS series, 301 iMRI series, and 356 segmentations collected from 114 consecutive patients at a single institution.

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) panels are utilized for genetic testing, still, a substantial proportion of the results remain uncertain and are not considered directly causative of epilepsy. This study aimed to reevaluate pediatric patients diagnosed with epilepsy who underwent genetic investigation using NGS panels, focusing on inconclusive variant findings or multiple Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUSs).Methods A subgroup of pediatric patients aged 0-25 years, diagnosed with epilepsy, who underwent genetic investigation with an NGS epilepsy panel at the Child Neurology Unit, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children’s Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, between 2018-2022 through Invitae, was reevaluated. Patients with inconclusive variant findings or multiple VUSs in their test results were included. Genetic data were analyzed, focusing on identifying potentially pathogenic variants and frequent genetic combinations.Results Two unrelated potentially pathogenic variants were identified in the SCN9A and QARS1 genes. A frequent genetic combination, RANBP2&RYR3, was also observed among other combinations. The RANBP2 gene consistently co-occurred with RYR3 variants in uncertain results, suggesting potential pathogenicity. Analysis of unaffected parents’ data revealed certain combinations inherited from different parents, suggesting specific gene combinations as potential risk factors for the disease.Significance This study highlights the importance of reevaluating genetic data from pediatric epilepsy patients with inconclusive variant findings or multiple VUSs. Identification of potentially pathogenic variants and frequent genetic combinations, such as RANBP2&RYR3, could aid in understanding the genetic basis of epilepsy and identifying potential hotspots.Plain Language Summary We have performed a retrospective analysis on a subpopulation of pediatric patients diagnosed with epilepsy, we have found that specific genetic variants were repeatable indicating their potential pathogenicity to the disease.Key points60% of pediatric patients undergoing genetic testing receive an uncertain result emphasizing the complexity of genetic interpretation in epilepsy diagnostics.Pathogenic variants in genes like SCN1A were common, underlining the importance of targeted gene sequencing.Variants in genes like SCN9A and QARS1, currently classified as VUSs, showed consistent presence in epilepsy patients, indicating potential pathogenicity.Specific genetic combinations, such as RANBP2&RYR3, were frequently observed among uncertain results, suggesting potential pathogenicity."

Analysis based on data from a register of road traffic crashes,"AbstractIntroduction According to the 2018–2019 People Mobility Survey, work-related journeys (commuting and on-duty journeys) account for approximately 25% of all journeys. The use of non-motorized (nm) and motorized (m) personal mobility devices (PMDs) has steadily increased since their introduction into the French market in the last decade.Objective This study aimed to describe the characteristics of work-related road crashes and their evolution since the introduction of new PMDs in France and the increase in the use of scooters.Materials and methods This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study using data from the Rhône Road Trauma Registry. Data were collected from 2015 to 2020. We included the data for the victims aged 18–70 years who were injured in work-related road crashes.Results We identified 11,296 individuals aged 18–70 years who experienced work-related road crashes. An injury report was provided for a total of 11,277 patients. A total of 546 passengers and 78 drivers of other motorized vehicles (buses/trams, construction equipment, and tractors) were excluded from the analysis. Seven patients died at the time of the crash, and seven died after hospitalization. Of the 10,653 (94.4%) victims, there were pedestrians (5.1%), or riders of bicycles (16.9%), scooters (3.8%), other PMDs (roller blades, skateboards, monowheels, gyropods, and hoverboards; 0.4%) and motorized two-wheeler (21.4%), or drivers of car (45.3%), and truck (1.5%). More than half of the scooter riders and 80% of other PMD riders were men. More than 60% of other PMD riders and 53% of scooter riders were under 34 years of age. Most scooter road crashes occurred during commuting (95.6%). Sixty-five percent of the scooter crashes and 50% of other PMD crashes did not have opponents. Overall, one-quarter of the victims experienced crashes without opponents. Most scooter riders had injuries to their upper limbs (59.2%), lower limbs (46.8%), face (21.2%) or head (17.9%).Discussion Most work-related road crashes were of low or moderate severity (97.5%; Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale, MAIS score < 3). The frequency and severity of injuries among scooter and other PMD users were similar. Scooter opponents were rarely observed in pedestrian injuries (12/575). Most scooter- and other PMD-crashes did not have opponents.Conclusion Many head injuries could be prevented with more widespread use of helmets, among scooter- and other PMD users and bicycle users.What is already known on this topicThe use of personal mobility devices (PMDs) has steadily increased in France.Work-related journeys (commuting and on-duty journeys) account for approximately 25% of all journeysWhat this study addsWe describe work-related road crashes’ characteristics since PMDs’ introduction.Work-related road crashes involving scooters or other PMDs riders are of low severity.Most scooter riders had injuries to their upper limbs (59.2%), lower limbs (46.8%), face (21.2%) or head (17.9%).How this study might affect research, practice or policyMany head injuries could be prevented with more widespread helmet use.Companies can take preventive actions to ensure that employees are better informed."

The lepidic subtype is a non-invasive tumor morphology, whereas the acinar subtype represents one of the invasive morphologies. This study investigates the transition from a non-invasive to an invasive subtype in the context of lung adenocarcinoma.Patients with pathologically confirmed mixed subtype tumors consented to analysis of RNA-seq data extracted from each subtype area separately.The study included 17 patients with tumors found to exhibit a lepidic-acinar transition. 87 genes were found to be differentially expressed between the lepidic and acinar subtypes, with 44 genes significantly upregulated in lepidic samples, and 43 genes significantly upregulated in acinar samples. Gene ontology analysis showed that many of the genes upregulated in the acinar subtype were related to immune response. Immune deconvolution analysis showed that there was a significantly higher proportion of M1 macrophages and total B cells in acinar areas. Immunohistochemistry showed that B cells were mainly localized to tertiary lymphoid structures in the tumor area.This is the first study to investigate the molecular features of mixed subtype lepidic-acinar transitional tumors. Immunological dynamics are presumed to be involved in this transition from lepidic to acinar subtype. Further research should be conducted to elucidate the progression of disease from non-invasive to invasive morphologies."

We aimed to identify genomic risk loci associated with anxiety, characterize its genetic architecture, and genetic overlap with psychiatric disorders.Methods We used the GWAS of anxiety symptoms, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We employed MiXeR and LAVA to characterize the genetic architecture and genetic overlap between the phenotypes. Conditional and conjunctional false discovery rate analyses were performed to boost the identification of genomic loci associated with anxiety and those shared with psychiatric disorders. Gene annotation and gene set analyses were conducted using OpenTargets and FUMA, respectively.Results Anxiety was polygenic with 12.9k estimated genetic risk variants and overlapped extensively with psychiatric disorders (4.1-11.4k variants). MiXeR and LAVA revealed predominantly positive genetic correlations between anxiety and psychiatric disorders. We identified 114 novel loci for anxiety by conditioning on the psychiatric disorders. We also identified loci shared between anxiety and major depression (n = 47), bipolar disorder (n = 33), schizophrenia (n = 71), and ADHD (n = 20). Genes annotated to anxiety loci exhibit enrichment for a broader range of biological pathways and differential tissue expression in more diverse tissues than those annotated to the shared loci.Conclusions Anxiety is a highly polygenic phenotype with extensive genetic overlap with psychiatric disorders. These genetic overlaps enabled the identification of novel loci for anxiety. The shared genetic architecture may underlie the extensive cross-disorder comorbidity of anxiety, and the identified genetic loci implicate molecular pathways that may lead to potential drug targets."

This study delineates the development of an online PSM curriculum for surgical trainees, in conjunction with a national consortium.Methods A needs assessment survey was administered to attending surgical oncologists and trainees within the consortium, with a focus on current educational practices and preferences for PSM training. The identified focus areas informed the formulation of specific learning objectives and content.Results The survey was completed by of 86/171 (48.5%) attending surgical oncologists in the group and 70 surgical trainees (56 residents and 14 fellows) from 31 unique institutions. Attending surgical oncologists emphasized trainee familiarity with general PSM principles and peritoneal metastases from lower gastrointestinal and gastric cancers when compared to gynecologic cancers and uncommon primaries (p < 0.001). Attending expectations increased incrementally with the trainee level in the knowledge and patient care domains. Attendings and trainees identified didactics and textbooks as primary modes of learning, although trainees reported using mobile learning tools more frequently. Disease site-specific educational content aligned with learning objectives was uploaded to a previously piloted online learning management system.

The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, has enabled real-time text generation and summarization of medical data. Further, recent advancements have enabled the integration of data analysis features in chatbots, such that raw data can be uploaded and analyzed when prompted. Studying both the accuracy and suitability of LLM-derived data analysis performed on medical time series data, such as CGM data, is an important area of research. The objective of this study was to assess the strengths and limitations of using an LLM to analyze raw CGM data and produce summaries of 14 days of data for patients with type 1 diabetes. This study used simulated CGM data from 10 different cases. We first evaluated the ability of GPT-4 to compute quantitative metrics specific to diabetes found in an Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP). Then, using two independent clinician graders, we evaluated the accuracy, completeness, safety, and suitability of qualitative descriptions produced by GPT-4 across five different CGM analysis tasks. We demonstrated that GPT-4 performs well across measures of accuracy, completeness, and safety when producing summaries of CGM data across all tasks. These results highlight the capabilities of using an LLM to produce accurate and safe narrative summaries of medical time series data. We highlight several limitations of the work, including concerns related to how GPT-4 may misprioritize highlighting instances of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Our work serves as a preliminary study on how generative language models can be integrated into diabetes care through CGM analysis, and more broadly, the potential to leverage LLMs for streamlined medical time series analysis."

However, MN can develop in CHIP negative individuals, indicating that additional markers of clonal expansion might also be informative. Heteroplasmy, defined as the presence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in a subset of cellular mtDNA, has been associated with hematological malignancies 2 and could represent a marker of clonal expansion 3. However, the relationship between heteroplamsy and CHIP, as well as its association with the incidence of MN in the general population is not known. In this study, we explored the association between somatic mtDNA and nuclear DNA (nDNA) mutations (mito-nuclear interaction), its impact on MN incidence, and whether its inclusion to the latest CHIP-based MN prediction algorithm could improve risk stratification in over 440,000 participants in the UK Biobank and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) studies. We found that heteroplasmy count and heteroplasmic variants predicted to be more deleterious were enriched in individuals with CHIP, particularly in those with significantly expanded clones (VAF ≥20%), with more than one CHIP mutation, and with mutations in the spliceosome machinery. Individuals with both heteroplasmy and CHIP were more likely to develop MN than participants with either entity alone. Furthermore, we found a significant and independent association of predicted pathogenic effect of heteroplasmic variants with incident MN, suggesting a causal role of mtDNA variations in MN pathogenesis, even in the absence of CHIP. Finally, incorporating heteroplasmy into an existing risk score model for MN in individuals with CHIP significantly improved the sensitivity by 13.1% and identified 34.4% more cases in the high-risk group (10-year risk ≥10%). In sum, our findings suggest that heteroplasmy, in addition to being a marker of clonal expansion, may be a causal biomarker of MN development, with clinical utility in the general population."

Single-cell transcriptomics offers a potential avenue to understand the underlying mechanisms of these variations and improve our ability to evaluate and predict vaccine effectiveness.Objective This study aimed to explore the potential of single-cell transcriptomic data in understanding the variability of antibody responses post-vaccination and its correlation with transcriptomic changes.Methods Blood samples were collected from 124 individuals on day 21 post COVID-19 vaccination. These samples were categorized based on antibody titers (high, medium, low). On day 135, PBMCs from 27 donors underwent single-cell RNA sequencing to depict the transcriptome atlas.Results Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) affecting antibody expression in various cell types were identified. We found that innate immunity, B cell, and T cell population each had a small set of common DEGs (MT-CO1, HLA-DQA2, FOSB, TXNIP, and JUN), and Macrophages and Th1 cells exhibited the largest number of DEGs. Pathway analysis highlighted the dominant role of the innate immune cell population in antibody differences among populations, with a significant impact from the interferon pathway. Furthermore, protein complexes analysis revealed that alterations in the ribosome complex, primarily regulated by DC cells, may play a crucial role in regulating antibody differences. Combining these findings with previous research we proposed a potential regulatory mechanism model of DC cells on B cell antibody production.Conclusion While direct prediction of specific antibody levels using single-cell transcriptomic data remains technically and data-wise challenging, our study demonstrated the vast potential of single-cell transcriptomics in understanding the mechanisms underlying antibody responses induced by vaccines."

We also evaluate ten state-of-the-art language models using 16 mental health-related questions designed to reflect various mental health conditions, such as psychosis, mania, depression, suicidal thoughts, and homicidal tendencies. The question design and response evaluations were conducted by mental health clinicians (M.D.s). We find that existing language models are insufficient to match the standard provided by human professionals who can navigate nuances and appreciate context. This is due to a range of issues, including overly cautious or sycophantic responses and the absence of necessary safeguards. Alarmingly, we find that most of the tested models could cause harm if accessed in mental health emergencies, failing to protect users and potentially exacerbating existing symptoms. We explore solutions to enhance the safety of current models. Before the release of increasingly task-autonomous AI systems in mental health, it is crucial to ensure that these models can reliably detect and manage symptoms of common psychiatric disorders to prevent harm to users. This involves aligning with the ethical framework and default behaviors outlined in our study. We contend that model developers are responsible for refining their systems per these guidelines to safeguard against the risks posed by current AI technologies to user mental health and safety.Trigger warning Contains and discusses examples of sensitive mental health topics, including suicide and self-harm."

Understanding factors associated with clinicians’ decisions to initiate treatment for individuals with negative test results is critical for predicting the potential impact of new diagnostics.Methods We performed a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis using studies conducted between January/2010 and December/2022 (PROSPERO: CRD42022287613). We included trials or cohort studies that enrolled individuals evaluated for TB in routine settings. In these studies participants were evaluated based on clinical examination and routinely-used diagnostics, and were followed for ≥1 week after the initial test result. We used hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression to identify factors associated with treatment initiation following a negative result on an initial bacteriological test (e.g., sputum smear microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF).Findings Multiple factors were positively associated with treatment initiation: male sex [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 1.61 (1.31–1.95)], history of prior TB [aOR 1.36 (1.06–1.73)], reported cough [aOR 4.62 (3.42–6.27)], reported night sweats [aOR 1.50 (1.21–1.90)], and having HIV infection but not on ART [aOR 1.68 (1.23–2.32)]. Treatment initiation was substantially less likely for individuals testing negative with Xpert [aOR 0.77 (0.62–0.96)] compared to smear microscopy and declined in more recent years.Interpretation Multiple factors influenced decisions to initiate TB treatment despite negative test results. Clinicians were substantially less likely to treat in the absence of a positive test result when using more sensitive, PCR-based diagnostics.Funding National Institutes of HealthEvidence before this study In countries with a high burden of tuberculosis, over one-third of notified cases for pulmonary TB are diagnosed based on clinical criteria, without bacteriological confirmation of disease (‘clinical diagnosis’). For these individuals with negative bacteriological test results, there is limited evidence on the factors associated with higher or lower rates of clinical diagnosis. In the context of individual clinical trials, some analyses have reported lower rates of treatment initiation for individuals testing negative on new cartridge-based PCR tests (e.g., Xpert MTB-RIF), as compared to individuals testing negative in sputum smear microscopy.Added value of this study This study conducted a systematic review of studies that collected data on patient characteristics and treatment initiation decisions for individuals receiving a negative bacteriological test result as part of initial evaluation for TB. Patient-level data from 13 countries across 12 studies (n=15121) were analyzed in an individual patient data meta-analysis, to describe factors associated with clinicians’ decisions to treat for TB disease. We identified significant associations between multiple clinical factors and the probability that a patient would be initiated on TB treatment, including sex, history of prior TB, reported symptoms (cough and night sweats), and HIV status. Controlling for other factors, patients testing negative on PCR-based diagnostics (e.g., Xpert MTB/RIF) were less likely to be initiated on treatment than those testing negative with smear microscopy.Implications of all the available evidence Rates of clinical diagnosis for TB differ systematically as a function of multiple clinical factors and are lower for patients who test negative with new PCR-based diagnostics compared to earlier smear-based methods. This evidence can be used to refine diagnostic algorithms and better understand the implications of introducing new diagnostic tests for TB."

While abnormal structural neuroimaging findings, in particular volume and thickness reductions, are often observed in schizophrenia, it is anticipated that biomarkers of neuronal injury like neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) can improve our understanding of the pathological basis underlying schizophrenia. The current study aimed to determine whether people with TRS demonstrate different associations between plasma NfL levels and regional cortical thickness reductions compared with controls.Study Design Measurements of plasma NfL and cortical thickness were obtained from 39 individuals with TRS, and 43 healthy controls. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences were obtained and processed via FreeSurfer. General linear mixed models adjusting for age and weight were estimated to determine whether the interaction between diagnostic group and plasma NfL level predicted lower cortical thickness across frontotemporal structures and the insula.Study Results. Significant (false discovery rate corrected) cortical thinning of the left (p = 0.001, η2p = 0.104) and right (p < 0.001, η2 = 0.167) insula was associated with higher levels of plasma NfL in TRS, but not in healthy controls.Conclusions. The association between regional thickness reduction of the insula bilaterally and plasma NfL may reflect a neurodegenerative process during the course of TRS. The findings of the present study suggest that some level of cortical degeneration localised to the bilateral insula may exist in people with TRS, which is not observed in the normal population."

Classically dystonia has been thought of as a disorder of the basal ganglia, but newer results in idiopathic dystonia and lesion-induced dystonia in adults point to broader motor network dysfunction spanning the basal ganglia, cerebellum, premotor cortex, sensorimotor, and frontoparietal regions. It is unclear whether a similar network is shared between different etiologies of pediatric lesion-induced dystonia.Methods Three cohorts of pediatric patients with lesion-induced dystonia were identified. The lesion etiologies included hypoxia, kernicterus, and stroke versus comparison subjects with acquired lesions not associated with dystonia. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and lesion network mapping were used to evaluate the anatomy and networks associated with dystonia.Results Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping showed that lesions of the putamen (stroke: r = 0.50, p <0.01; hypoxia, r = 0.64, p <0.001) and globus pallidus (kernicterus, r = 0.61, p <0.01) were associated with dystonia. Lesion network mapping using normative connectome data from healthy children demonstrated that these regional findings occurred within a common brain-wide network that involves the basal ganglia, anterior and medial cerebellum, and cortical regions that overlap the cingulo-opercular and somato-cognitive-action networks.Interpretation We interpret these findings as novel evidence for a unified dystonia brain network that involves the somato-cognitive-action network, which is involved in higher order coordination of movement. Elucidation of this network gives insight into the functional origins of dystonia and provides novel targets to investigate for therapeutic intervention."

We investigated the prevalence and population attributable fraction (PAF) of 12 potentially modifiable risk factors for all-cause dementia in middle-aged and older Canadians.Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of data from the Comprehensive cohort of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, a national sample of 30,097 individuals between the ages of 45 and 85 at baseline (2011-2015). Risk factors and associated relative risks were taken from a highly cited systematic review published by an international commission on dementia prevention. We estimated the prevalence of each risk factor using sampling weights to be more generalizable to the Canadian population. Individual PAFs were calculated both crudely and weighted for communality, and combined PAFs were calculated with methods reflecting both multiplicative and additive interaction assumptions. Analyses were additionally performed stratified by household income and were repeated at CSLA’s first three-year follow-up (2015-2018).Results The most prevalent risk factors at baseline were physical inactivity (63.8%; 95% CI, 62.8% – 64.9%), hypertension (32.8%; 31.7% – 33.8%), and obesity (30.8%; 29.7% – 31.8%). The highest crude PAFs were for physical inactivity (19.9%), traumatic brain injury (16.7%), and hypertension (16.6%). The highest weighted PAFs were for physical inactivity (11.6%), depression (7.7%), and hypertension (6.0%). We estimated that the 12 risk factors combined accounted for 43.4% (37.3%-49.0%) of dementia cases assuming weighted multiplicative interactions and 60.9% (55.7%-65.5%) assuming additive interactions. There was a clear gradient of increasing prevalence and PAF with decreasing income for 9 of the 12 risk factors.Interpretation The findings of this study can inform individual and population-level dementia prevention strategies in Canada, focusing efforts on risk factors with the largest impact on the number of dementia cases. Differences in the impact of individual risk factors between this study and other international and regional studies highlight the importance of tailoring national dementia strategies to the local distribution of risk factors."

We found a link between an increase of low-frequency coupling in the delta band and alterations in neural information processing in the first weeks after stroke and their relevance for motor recovery more than three months later. We demonstrate that stroke to the motor system leading to impaired hand motor function induce an enhancement of slow activity and delta coupling between frontocentral and parietal regions. In addition, we could show a loss of the physiological network architecture with a decrease of small-worldness and modularity in the delta frequency, implying that a focal ischemic lesion distant to the cerebral cortex interferes with both cortical information integration as well as functional segregation within the days and weeks after stroke. While we found a link between bifrontal coupling in the alpha spectrum and the degree of the motor deficit in the early post-acute phase, the amount of small worldness disruption early after stroke indicated the motor outcome three months later. In contrast, recovery of motor function and cortical reorganization after more than three months post-stroke were paralleled by a normalization of increased low-frequency coupling and a reinstatement of the complex network structure featuring a small-world and modular topology."

Three types of data were used: es.statista.com, datosmacro.expansion.com and larepublica.co without modification, but trying to avoid and justify the anomalies and inconsistencies observed. The methods originally used to establish the interactions of two populations were evaluated: the viral population with that of its host and the drift of both organisms. Only the interactive fluctuations of the weekly Variance of daily increase of Cases (Morbidity) were studied. The results showed that the Fluctuation Test is applicable to the selected data from USA, UK, Taiwan and China and other data from several countries used as controls. The study was separated into two approaches: First, comparison of the total or partial logarithmic profile of fluctuations of Variance of Cases (Morbidity) of USA, UK, Taiwan and China. Second, comparison of the values of the first fluctuation of Variance of Cases (Morbidity) in the boreal winter of 2020 for USA, UK, Taiwan, China and several countries used as controls. The results obtained for Morbidity demonstrate that USA and UK present a similar bimodal profile. China shows an inverted profile and Taiwan shows an intermediate profile between both tendencies. However, it was possible to detect some anomalies and uncertainties that were possibly derived from inconsistencies in the original data. Only USA shows a value of the first fluctuation comparable to the order of magnitude of the value of the first fluctuation of the Variance of Cases of China, in the northern winter of 2020. In the First Approach USA, UK and China had two important fluctuations: the first in the northern winter of 2020 before week 16 and the second at the beginning of northern winter of 2022, more than 100 weeks later. Taiwan showed only the latter. This latest fluctuation coincides with two events: the possible achievement of herd immunity and the emergence of Omicron variant. In this work we have evaluated whether this coincidence is casual or causal. The results obtained in the Second Approach aim to confirm the hypothesis of the animal origin of the first variant of SARS CoV-2."

Most infections are low-parasitemia, with an unknown proportion below routine microscopy detection thresholds. Molecular surveillance tools optimizing the limit of detection (LOD) would allow more accurate estimates of zoonotic malaria prevalence.Methods An established ultra-sensitive Plasmodium genus quantitative-PCR (qPCR) assay targeting the 18S rRNA gene underwent LOD evaluation with and without reverse transcription (RT) for P. knowlesi, P. cynomolgi and P. vivax using total nucleic acid preserved (DNA/RNA ShieldTM) isolates and archived dried blood spots (DBS). LODs for selected P. knowlesi-specific assays, and reference P. vivax- and P. cynomolgi-specific assays were determined with RT. Assay specificities were assessed using clinical malaria samples and malaria-negative controls.Results The use of reverse transcription improved Plasmodium species detection by up to 10,000-fold (Plasmodium genus), 2759-fold (P. knowlesi), 1000-fold (P. vivax) and 10-fold (P. cynomolgi). The median LOD with RT for the Kamau et al. Plasmodium genus RT-qPCR assay was ≤0.0002 parasites/µL for P. knowlesi and 0.002 parasites/µL for both P. cynomolgi and P. vivax. The LODs with RT for P. knowlesi-specific PCRs were: Imwong et al. 18S rRNA (0.0007 parasites/µL); Divis et al. real-time 18S rRNA (0.0002 parasites/µL); Lubis et al. hemi-nested SICAvar (1.1 parasites/µL) and Lee et al. nested 18S rRNA (11 parasites/µL). The LOD for P. vivax- and P. cynomolgi-specific assays with RT were 0.02 and 0.20 parasites/µL respectively. For DBS P. knowlesi samples the median LOD for the Plasmodium genus qPCR with RT was 0.08, and without RT was 19.89 parasites/uL (249-fold change); no LOD improvement was demonstrated in DBS archived beyond 6 years. The Plasmodium genus and P. knowlesi-assays were 100% specific for Plasmodium species and P. knowlesi detection, respectively, from 190 clinical infections and 48 healthy controls. Reference P. vivax-specific primers demonstrated known cross-reactivity with P. cynomolgi.Conclusion Our findings support the use of an 18S rRNA Plasmodium genus qPCR and species-specific nested PCR protocol with RT for highly-sensitive surveillance of zoonotic and human Plasmodium species infections.Author Summary The monkey malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi has been found to increasingly infect humans across Southeast Asia via the bite of it’s anopheline mosquito vectors. Human infections with a similar monkey parasite, Plasmodium cynomologi, have also been reported. The diagnostic tools commonly used to detect these malaria species are often unable to detect very low-level infections. We aimed to to improve surveillance detection tools and blood sample collection methods to detect these zoonotic malaria species and understand the extent of transmission and the burden of disease. This study validated and compared the use of molecular laboratory assays targeting these species. We found that with the use of reverse transcription, large improvements in the limit of detection were possible, by up to 10,000-fold for initial malaria screening, and up to 2759-fold for specific P. knowlesi detection. Findings from this study support the use of ultrasensitive detection tools to improve surveillance approaches to emerging zoonotic malaria species."

Examining spatial heterogeneity of menstrual discriminatory practices presents an opportunity for targeted interventions. Our goal was to evaluate geographical disparities in menstrual restrictions among Nepalese women and assess their association with socio-economic and demographic factors.Methodology We utilized data from the 2022 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, focusing on women aged 15 to 49 who had experienced a menstrual period in the last year. Our analysis explored the spatial patterns of menstrual restriction outcomes related to engagement in religious activities, household level restrictions, and the severe form of menstrual restrictions referred to Chhaupadi. The standard Gaussian kernel density estimation was used to create continuous prevalence maps and the spatial scan statistic was used to detect local clusters. The association between the different forms of menstrual restriction and the socio-economic, and demographic factors were examined using the Poisson regression model with robust standard errors.Findings Overall, the prevalence of women who reported any form of menstrual restriction was 84.8% and was subject to geographical variations ranging from 79.0% in Bagmati to 95.6% in Sudurpashchim. Religious restrictions were the most prevalent (79.8%) followed by household level restrictions (39.5%) and then Chhaupadi (6.2%). Geographical variations were detected in all forms of menstrual restriction outcomes and were more prominent for Chhaupadi. Individual level factors (age, sex, ethnicity/caste), household level factors (household wealth, age and sex of the household head) and regional factors (province) were significantly associated with at least one form of menstrual restriction outcome. Strikingly, women who reside in households led by female household heads were less likely to report experiencing household level restriction during menstruation (Adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) =0.89 [95%CI: 0.84–0.94], p<0.001) whilst those residing in wealthy households were associated with lower likelihood of experiencing Chhaupadi (aPR =0.26 [95%CI: 0.17-0.39] among the richest).Interpretation We observed geographical micro-variations in menstrual discriminatory practices in Nepal presenting an opportunity for targeted behavioral interventions. Women empowerment is a promising strategy in the fight against menstrual discrimination within the household. Therefore, community-based targeted interventions should be designed and tested to determine their utility against Chhaupadi in these settings."

Most primary infections with the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) are inapparent; nevertheless, prior research has primarily focused on symptomatic infections, which has limited our understanding of the epidemiological burden and spectrum of disease of each DENV serotype. Our study addresses this bottleneck in dengue research by providing a new method and a detailed examination of primary inapparent infections.Methods Here we present (1) the evaluation of a multiplex DENV1-4 envelope domain III multiplex microsphere-based assay (EDIII-MMBA) to serotype inapparent primary infections and (2) its application leveraging 17 years of prospective sample collection from the Nicaraguan Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study. After evaluation, we analyzed 46% (N=574) of total inapparent primary DENV infections with the EDIII-MMBA. Remaining infections were inferred using stochastic imputation, taking year and neighborhood of infection into account.Findings The EDIII-MMBA demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy of symptomatic and inapparent primary DENV infections when evaluated against gold-standard serotyping methods. Significant within- and between-year variation in serotype distribution between symptomatic and inapparent infections and circulation of serotypes undetected in symptomatic cases were observed in multiple years. Our findings reveal that a significant majority of primary infections remained inapparent: 76.8% for DENV1, 79.9% for DENV2, and 63.9% for DENV3. DENV3 exhibited the highest likelihood of symptomatic and severe primary infections (Pooled OR compared to DENV1 = 2.13, 95% CI 1.28-3.56, and 6.75, 2.01-22.62, respectively), whereas DENV2 had similar likelihood to DENV1 in both analyses.Interpretation Our study indicates that case surveillance skews the perceived epidemiological footprint of DENV and reveals a more complex and intricate pattern of serotype distribution in inapparent infections. Further, the significant differences in infection outcomes by serotype emphasizes the need for serotype-informed public health strategies.Funding NIH/NIAID P01AI106695, U01AI153416Evidence before this study We conducted a search in PubMed for studies published up to February 2024. Keywords included “dengue virus” and “DENV” in combination with “inapparent infections”, “asymptomatic infections”, “primary infections by serotype”, “FoI by serotype”, “force of infection”, “force of infection by serotype”, and identified a significant gap in the current understanding of dengue epidemiology. Despite acknowledging the high prevalence of inapparent DENV infections in endemic regions, previous research has focused primarily on symptomatic infections, potentially biasing our understanding of the DENV epidemiological landscape and hindering our capacity to determine the complete disease spectrum of the different DENV serotypes. While cross-sectional studies have provided preliminary insights into this gap, there is a need for more comprehensive and detailed serotype-specific insights to evaluate the epidemiological impact of inapparent infections. The lack of comprehensive characterization of inapparent infections reflects methodological challenges, particularly the need for prospective cohort studies designed to capture and accurately serotype these infections. Moreover, the reliance on labor-intensive and low-throughput antibody neutralization assays for serotyping, despite their accuracy, has constrained high-throughput analysis required for large-scale epidemiological studies.Added value of this study Our study, spanning 17 years of prospective cohort data in Nicaragua, addresses this bottleneck in dengue research by providing a detailed examination of primary inapparent infections. The introduction of a novel envelope domain III (EDIII) multiplex microsphere-based assay for DENV serotyping represents a significant methodological advance, offering an efficient, scalable alternative for large epidemiological studies. A key contribution of our study is the intricate pattern of serotype distribution among inapparent infections. In contrast to the serotype predominance observed in symptomatic infections, inapparent infections exhibit a complex landscape with co-circulation of multiple DENV serotypes, including serotypes undetected in symptomatic surveillance in multiple years. Our systematic documentation of the entire disease spectrum provides unprecedented insights into the serotype-specific disease burden in primary infection, including the proportion of symptomatic versus inapparent infection and its temporal variations, thus providing a more complete picture of DENV epidemiology than has been available to date. Notably, we demonstrate striking differences in disease severity by serotype, with DENV3 infections being significantly more symptomatic and more severe compared to DENV1 and DENV2, the latter displaying the highest rate of inapparent infection.Implications of all the available evidence Our research challenges prior assumptions by demonstrating that inapparent and symptomatic primary DENV infections present distinct epidemiological profiles, revealing that the epidemiological footprint of DENV is broader and more nuanced than previously recognized through symptomatic cases alone. These findings underscore the utility for continuous and comprehensive surveillance systems that capture both symptomatic and inapparent infections to accurately assess the epidemiological burden of DENV and inform public health interventions. Additionally, they provide critical insight for enhancing the accuracy of predictive DENV transmission modeling. Furthermore, the marked differences in infection outcomes by serotype emphasize the need for serotype-informed public health strategies. This nuanced understanding is pivotal for the crafting of targeted interventions, vaccine development and vaccination strategies, and efficient resource allocation, ultimately contributing to the global effort to mitigate the impact of dengue."

We estimate the variability in risk and relative risk of adiposity based on diagnostic criteria like fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1C% (HA1C%).Research Design and Methods We estimated transition rate from prediabetes, as defined by fasting glucose between 100-125 and/or 110-125 mg/dL, and HA1C% between 5.7-6.5% in participant data from the Framingham Heart Study, Multi-Ethnic Study on Atherosclerosis, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, and the Jackson Heart Study. We estimated the heterogeneity and prediction interval across cohorts, stratifying by age, sex, and body mass index. For individuals who were prediabetic, we estimated the relative risk for obesity, blood pressure, education, age, and sex for diabetes.Results There is substantial heterogeneity in diabetes transition rates across cohorts and prediabetes definitions with large prediction intervals. We observed the highest range of rates in individuals with fasting glucose of 110-125 mg/dL ranging from 2-18 per 100 person-years. Across different cohorts, the association obesity or hypertension in the progression to diabetes was consistent, yet it varied in magnitude. We provide a database of transition rates across subgroups and cohorts for comparison in future studies.Conclusion The absolute transition rate from prediabetes to diabetes significantly depends on cohort and prediabetes definitions.Twitter Summary New study finds variable diabetes risk in prediabetes across US cohorts. Results highlight obesity, Black race, and hypertension as key factors, emphasizing the need for precision in diabetes care. #DiabetesResearch"

Clinical decision support tools predicting transplant outcomes are lacking. This project uses interpretable methods to predict both graft failure and patient death using data from previously accepted kidney transplant offers. Using more than twenty years of transplant outcome data, we train and compare several survival analysis models in single risk settings. In addition, we use post hoc interpretability techniques to clinically validate these models. Neural networks show comparable performance to the Cox proportional hazard model, with concordance of 0.63 and 0.79 for prediction of graft failure and patient death, respectively. Recipient and donor ages, primary renal disease, the number of mismatches at DR locus, and calculated reaction frequency at transplant appear to be important features for transplant outcome prediction. Owing to their good predictive performance and the clinical relevance of their post hoc interpretation, neural networks represent a promising core component in the construction of future decision support systems for transplant offering."

However, owing to limitations of traditional GI sampling approaches, the SI remains challenging to directly access on a large scale. This work presents the Small Intestinal MicroBiome Aspiration Capsule (SIMBA) as an effective means for sampling SI luminal content.Design In an observational clinical study, SIMBA capsules were ingested by both healthy individuals and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) patients on two successive visits. On a first visit, X-ray scans were used to evaluate SI targeting accuracy. On a second visit, SIMBA capsule ingestion was paired with duodenal endoscopy and saliva samples for reference. For both visits, SIMBA capsules were retrieved with matching fecal samples to evaluate effective sealing during GI transit.Results X-ray monitoring confirmed all capsules sampled from the distal small intestine with a few (5 of 49) sealing in the proximal colon. Overall, 94% of capsules were retrieved by subjects with median total gut transit time of 47 hours (IQR 24-54). Capsule sampling location and duration was also not significantly affected by IBS. Multi-omics analysis showed that microbiota and metabolomic composition of SIMBA capsules were significantly different to fecal samples, and similar to endoscopic aspirate and cytological brush sampling.Conclusions The SIMBA capsule reliably captures and preserves SI luminal fluid in a clinically relevant context that is suitable for multi-omics data analysis, comparable to duodenal aspirate, and complements fecal sampling in its broad applicability of use.KEY MESSAGES What is already known on this topicResearch into the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome and its role in health and disease is almost completely biased towards the colon due to the reliance on fecal sampling.Owing to the lack of reliable and scalable sampling approaches, our knowledge of the small intestine (SI) microbiome is significantly lagging by comparison.What this study addsThis study presents the Small Intestine Microbiome Aspiration (SIMBA) capsule which targets the distal SI in a reliable and reproducible fashion and collects high-quality multi-omics datasets that are on par with “gold-standard” endoscopic sampling.The SIMBA capsule was compared against established sampling methodologies, providing a multi-omics glimpse into the entire biogeographic diversity of the GI tract, revealing substantial and biologically meaningful differences in both microbiome and metabolic profiles that reinforce the significant difference between SI and feces.Overall, the SIMBA capsule demonstrates clear and reproducible differences in microbiome composition of the SI that is otherwise lacking from traditionally used fecal sampling.How this study might affect research, practice or policyThe SIMBA capsule collects high-quality multi-omics datasets that will enable significant insights into the SI microbiome function in health and disease and is ideal for use in research, large-scale clinical or population studies, and diagnostic applications."

Despite its first description nearly four decades, the precise molecular basis of this condition remained elusive until the recent discovery of de novo variants in the KIF5B-related kyphomelic dysplasia. We ascertained two unrelated consanguineous families with kyphomelic dysplasia. They had six affected offsprings and we performed a detailed clinical evaluation, skeletal survey, and exome sequencing in three probands. All the probands had short stature, cleft palate, and micro-retrognathia. Radiographs revealed kyphomelic femora, bowing of long bones, radial head dislocations and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia. We noted two novel homozygous variants in CCN2 as possible candidates that segregated with the phenotype in the families: a missense variant c.443G>A; p.(Cys148Tyr) in exon 3 and a frameshift variant, c.779_786del; p.(Pro260LeufsTer7) in exon 5. CCN2 is crucial for proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes. Earlier studies have shown that Ccn2-deficient mice exhibit twisted limbs, short and kinked sterna, broad vertebrae, domed cranial vault, shorter mandibles, cleft palate and impaired osteoclastogenesis. We studied the impact of CCN2 knockout in zebrafish models via CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. F0 knockouts of ccn2a in zebrafish showed altered body curvature, impaired cartilage formation in craniofacial region and either bent or missing tails recapitulating the human phenotype. Our observations in humans and zebrafish combined with previously described skeletal phenotype of Ccn2 knock out mice, confirm that biallelic loss of function variants in CCN2 result in an autosomal recessive kyphomelic dysplasia."

Previous models predicted schistosomiasis’ thermal optimum at 21.7 °C, which is not compatible with the temperature in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) regions where schistosomiasis is hyperendemic. We performed an extensive literature search for empirical data on the effect of temperature on physiological and epidemiological parameters regulating the free-living stages of S. mansoni and S. haematobium and their obligate host snails, i.e., Biomphalaria spp. and Bulinus spp., respectively. We derived nonlinear thermal responses fitted on these data to parameterize a mechanistic, process-based model of schistosomiasis. We then re-cast the basic reproduction number and the prevalence of schistosome infection as functions of temperature. We found that the thermal optima for transmission of S. mansoni and S. haematobium range between 23.1-27.3 °C and 23.6-27.9 °C (95 % CI) respectively. We also found that the thermal optimum shifts toward higher temperatures as the human water contact rate increases with temperature. Our findings align with an extensive dataset of schistosomiasis prevalence in SSA. The refined nonlinear thermal-response model developed here suggests a more suitable current climate and a greater risk of increased transmission with future warming for more than half of the schistosomiasis suitable regions with mean annual temperature below the thermal optimum.Authors’ summary In this research, we explored the complex interplay between temperature and the transmission risk of schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease currently affecting over two hundred million people, predominantly in SSA. We developed a novel mathematical model accounting for the multiple positive and negative ways temperature affects the free-living stages of the parasite and its obligate, non-human host, i.e., specific species of freshwater snails. Our models show that schistosomiasis transmission risk peaks at temperatures 1-6°C higher than previously estimated. This indicates that the impact of climate change on schistosomiasis transmission might be more extensive than previously thought, affecting a wide geographic range where mean annual temperatures are currently below the optimal temperature. Our model projections are consistent with the observed temperatures in locations of SSA where schistosomiasis is endemic and data on infection prevalence in the human population are available. These findings suggest that the current climate is conducive to schistosomiasis transmission, and future warming could escalate the risk further, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions in these regions."

However, it remains unclear whether the same associations can be observed for within-subject changes in RAR.Methods Our longitudinal investigation on RAR used Fitbit data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study at the 2-year (FL2: aged 10-13 years) and 4-year follow-up (FL4: aged 13-16 years). 963 youths had good-quality Fitbit data at both time points. In this study we examined changes in RAR from FL2 to FL4, their environmental and demographic contributors as well as brain and behavioral correlates.Results From FL2 to FL4, adolescents showed decreases in sleep duration and physical activity as well as delayed sleep timing (Cohen’s d .44-.75). The contributions of environmental and demographic factors to RAR changes were greatest to sleep timing (explained 10% variance) and least to sleep duration (explained 1% variance). Delays in sleep timing had stronger correlations with behavioral problems including greater impulsivity and poor academic performance than reductions in sleep duration or physical activity. Additionally, the various brain measures differed in their sensitivity to RAR changes. Reductions in sleep duration were associated with decreased brain functional connectivity between subcortical regions and sensorimotor and cingulo-opercular networks and with enhanced functional connectivity between sensorimotor, visual and auditory networks. Delays in sleep timing were mainly associated with grey matter changes in subcortical regions.Conclusions The current findings corroborate the role of sleep and physical activity in adolescent’s brain neurodevelopment and behavior problems. RAR might serve as biomarkers for monitoring behavioral problems in adolescents and to serve as potential therapeutic targets for mental disorders."

Here, we apply three state-of-the-art pathogenicity prediction models to classify hereditary breast cancer gene variants in the UK Biobank. Predicted pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, but not ATM and CHEK2, were associated with increased breast cancer risk. We explored gene-specific score thresholds for variant pathogenicity, finding that they could improve model performance. However, when specifically tasked with classifying variants of uncertain significance, the deep learning models were generally of limited clinical utility."

Diagnosis is essential to reducing the number of cases and starting treatment, but costly tests and equipments that require complex infrastructure hamper their widespread use as a tool to contain the disease in vulnerable populations as well countries lacking resources. Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop new technological approaches to molecular methods as well as screening tests that can be rapidly conducted among people presenting to a health facility to differentiate those who should have further diagnostic evaluation for TB from those who should undergo further investigation for non-TB diagnoses. The present study aimed to evaluate two experimental DNA extraction methods from clinical samples (FTA card versus sonication) followed by analysis in a portable qPCR instrument (the Q3-plus). The FTA card-based protocol showed 100% sensitivity and specificity, while the sonication protocol showed 80% sensitivity and 89% specificity when compared to the traditional gold standard culture. The portable protocol, comprised by the FTA card method and the portable instrument Q3-Plus, showed sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 61%, respectively, when compared to culture, and 75% and 81%, respectively, when compared to the standard TB case classification. The ROC curve showed an AUC of 0.78 (p<0.001) for the portable protocol and 0.93 (p<0.001) for the GeneXpert MTB/RIF. The limit of detection (LOD) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv strain) detection in spiked samples obtained using the portable protocol (FTA card and Q3-Plus) was 19.3 CFU/mL. As an added benefit, using the FTA card facilitates sample handling, transport, and storage. It is concluded that the use of the FTA card protocol and the Q3-Plus yields similar sensitivity and specificity as the gold standard diagnostic tests and case classification. We suggest that the platform is suitable to use as a point of care tool, assisting in the screening of tuberculosis in hard-to-reach or resource-limited areas."

Characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior, and cognitive impairment, this condition has an early onset and chronic trajectory, making it a debilitating challenge. Schizophrenia also imposes a substantial burden on society, exacerbated by the stigma associated with mental disorders. Technological advancements, such as computerized semantic, linguistic, and acoustic analyses, are revolutionizing the understanding and assessment of communication alterations, a significant aspect in various severe mental illnesses. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for improving prognosis and implementing appropriate treatments. In this context, the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has provided new perspectives for the treatment of schizophrenia, with machine learning techniques and natural language processing allowing a more detailed analysis of clinical, neurological, and behavioral data sets. The present article aims to present a proposal for computational models for the identification of schizophrenic traits in texts. The database used in this article was created with 139 excerpts of patients’ speeches reported in the book “Memories of My Nervous Disease” by German judge Daniel Paul Schreber, classifying them into three categories: 1 - schizophrenic, 2 - with schizophrenic traits and 3 - without any relation to the disorder. Of these speeches, 104 were used for training the models and the others 35 for validation.Three classification models were implemented using features based on geometric properties of graphs (number of vertices, number of cycles, girth, vertex of maximum degree, maximum clique size) and text entropy. Promising results were observed in the classification, with the Decision Tree-based model [1] achieving 100% accuracy, the KNN-k-Nearest Neighbor model observed with 62.8% accuracy, and the ‘centrality-based’ model with 59% precision. The high precision rates, observed when geometric properties are incorporated into Artificial Intelligence Models, suggest that the models can be improved to the point of capturing the language deviation traits that are indicative of schizophrenic disorders. In summary, this study paves the way for significant advances in the use of geometric properties in the field of psychiatry, offering a new data-based approach to the understanding and therapy of schizophrenia."

False negative urine culture results can lead to the inappropriate use of antimicrobial therapies or to the progression to urosepsis in high-risk patients. Though not commonly applied to urine in a clinical setting, Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based metagenomics offer a solution as a precision diagnostic. We developed and validated BIOTIA-ID, a clinical-grade NGS-based diagnostic pipeline for the detection and identification of pathogens in urine specimens. Remnant clinical urine specimens, and contrived sterile urine spiked with common UTI pathogens, were processed with our end-to-end assay including extraction, metagenomic library preparation and Illumina NextSeq 550 sequencing. We trained and applied a bioinformatic pipeline that uses machine learning (ML) to identify pathogens. Internal controls and other quality control measures were incorporated into the process to provide rigorous and standardized results. The assay was tested on 1,470 urine specimens and achieved 99.92% sensitivity, 99.95% specificity and a limit of detection (LoD) of <25,000 CFU/mL and <5,000 CFU/mL in bacteria and fungi, respectively. Discordant results were reconciled with additional testing by target-specific qPCR or 16S Sanger sequencing; 87% of the NGS results were ultimately determined to be the correct result. Overall, these data demonstrate that BIOTIA-ID is a highly accurate clinical-grade diagnostic tool with notable advantages over current culture- based diagnostics.Conflict of Interest Statement MCR, DCD, HLW, SR, XJS, JP, PFC, GF, CEM, CO, NBO and DNS are employees at Biotia, Inc."

An open-source model with intuitive structure for model cross-validation can support the transparency and credibility of such evaluations. We describe the new IPECAD open-source model framework (version 2) for the health-economic evaluation of early AD treatment and use it for cross-validation and addressing uncertainty.Methods A cohort state transition model using a categorized composite domain (cognition and function) was developed by replicating an existing reference model and testing it for internal validity. Then, features of existing “ICER” and “AD-ACE” models assessing lecanemab treatment were implemented for model cross-validation. Additional uncertainty scenarios were performed on choice of efficacy outcome from trial, natural disease progression, treatment effect waning and stopping rules, and other methodological choices. The model is available open-source as R code, spreadsheet and web-based version via https://github.com/ronhandels/IPECAD.Results In the IPECAD model incremental life years, QALY gains and cost savings were 21-31% smaller compared to the ICER model and 36-56% smaller compared to the AD-ACE model. IPECAD model results were particularly sensitive to assumptions on treatment effect waning and stopping rules and choice of efficacy outcome from trial.Conclusions We demonstrated the ability of a new IPECAD opens-source model framework for researchers and decision-makers to cross-validate other (HTA submission) models and perform additional uncertainty analyses, setting an example for open science in AD decision modeling and supporting important reimbursement decisions."

From whole-exome and genome sequencing of 100,814 participants in the Pakistan Genome Resource, we identified fifteen SLC30A8 knockouts, including homozygotes for a variant enriched in South Asians (Gln174Ter) and 615 heterozygotes for loss-of-function (LoF) variants. T2D risk was lower in SLC30A8 LoF hetero- and homozygotes, and the protective effect strengthens in a gene dose-dependent manner (ORadditive=0.63 [0.53-0.78, p=7.5E-07], ORrecessive=0.27 [0.09-0.80, p=0.018]). Recall-by-genotype of SLC30A8 LoF hetero- and homozygotes and their family members with oral glucose tolerance tests showed a gene dose-dependent reduction in glucose levels coupled with elevated insulin. Corrected Insulin Response, Disposition Index, and Insulin Sensitivity Index in LoF hetero- and homozygotes indicated higher glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with preserved beta cell function. These data suggest that therapeutic knockdown of SLC30A8, up to and including complete knockout, may treat T2D safely and effectively."

However, medication-induced biomarker trajectories stemming from such records remain poorly studied. Here, we extract clinical and medication prescription data from EHRs and conduct GWAS and rare variant burden tests in the UK Biobank (discovery) and the All of Us program (replication) on ten cardiometabolic drug response outcomes including lipid response to statins, HbA1c response to metformin and blood pressure response to antihypertensives (N = 740-26,669). Our findings at genome-wide significance level recover previously reported pharmacogenetic signals and also include novel associations for lipid response to statins (N = 26,669) near LDLR and ZNF800. Importantly, these associations are treatment-specific and not associated with biomarker progression in medication-naive individuals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that individuals with higher genetically determined low-density and total cholesterol baseline levels experience increased absolute, albeit lower relative biomarker reduction following statin treatment. In summary, we systematically investigated the common and rare pharmacogenetic contribution to cardiometabolic drug response phenotypes in over 50,000 UK Biobank and All of Us participants with EHR and identified clinically relevant genetic predictors for improved personalized treatment strategies."

We performed a nationwide test-negative case-control study within the US Veterans Affairs Healthcare System to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) of BNT162b2 XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine compared to not receiving an XBB vaccine of any kind against COVID-19 hospitalization, emergency department or urgent care visits (ED/UC), and outpatient visits. Between September 25, 2023 and January 31, 2024, effectiveness was 24–35% during a period of JN.1 predominance and 50–61% during XBB predominance across all outcomes. VE within 60 days of vaccination during the likely JN.1 period was 32% (95% confidence interval 3-52%) against hospitalization, 41% (23–54%) against ED/UC visits, and 31% (1–52%) against outpatient visits. Corresponding VE during the likely XBB period was 62% (44–74%), 52% (37–63%), and 50% (25–66%) by setting, respectively.

Using mechanistic inference of node-edge relationship (MINER), we have analyzed multiomics profiles from 516 patients and constructed an atlas of causal and mechanistic drivers of interpatient heterogeneity in GBM (gbmMINER). The atlas has delineated how 30 driver mutations act in a combinatorial scheme to causally influence a network of regulators (306 transcription factors and 73 miRNAs) of 179 transcriptional “programs”, influencing disease progression in patients across 23 disease states. Through extensive testing on independent patient cohorts, we share evidence that a machine learning model trained on activity profiles of programs within gbmMINER significantly augments risk stratification, identifying patients who are super-responders to standard of care and those that would benefit from 2nd line treatments. In addition to providing mechanistic hypotheses regarding disease prognosis, the activity of programs containing targets of 2nd line treatments accurately predicted efficacy of 28 drugs in killing glioma stem-like cells from 43 patients. Our findings demonstrate that interpatient heterogeneity manifests from differential activities of transcriptional programs, providing actionable strategies for mechanistically characterizing GBM from a systems perspective and developing better prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized medicine."

For example, time to death from life tables cannot be accurately sampled from existing parametric distributions. We propose an efficient nonparametric method to sample times to events that does not require any parametric assumption on the hazards.Methods We developed a nonparametric sampling (NPS) approach that simultaneously draws multiple time-to-event samples from a categorical distribution. This approach can be applied to univariate and multivariate processes. The probabilities for each time interval are derived from the time interval-specific constant hazards. The times to events can then be used directly in individual-level simulation models. We compared the accuracy of our approach in sampling time-to-events from common parametric distributions, including exponential, Gamma, and Gompertz. In addition, we evaluated the method’s performance in sampling age to death from US life tables and sampling times to events from parametric baseline hazards with time-dependent covariates.Results The NPS method estimated similar expected times to events from 1 million draws for the three parametric distributions, 100,000 draws for the homogenous cohort, 200,000 draws from the heterogeneous cohort, and 1 million draws for the parametric distributions with time-varying covariates, all in less than a second.Conclusion Our method produces accurate and computationally efficient samples for time-to-events from hazards without requiring parametric assumptions. This approach can substantially reduce the computation time required to simulate individual-level models."

AbstractBackground The integration of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare offers immense opportunity to streamline healthcare tasks, but also carries risks such as response accuracy and bias perpetration. To address this, we conducted a red-teaming exercise to assess LLMs in healthcare and developed a dataset of clinically relevant scenarios for future teams to use.Methods We convened 80 multi-disciplinary experts to evaluate the performance of popular LLMs across multiple medical scenarios. Teams composed of clinicians, medical and engineering students, and technical professionals stress-tested LLMs with real world clinical use cases. Teams were given a framework comprising four categories to analyze for inappropriate responses: Safety, Privacy, Hallucinations, and Bias. Prompts were tested on GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, and GPT-4.0 with the Internet. Six medically trained reviewers subsequently reanalyzed the prompt-response pairs, with dual reviewers for each prompt and a third to resolve discrepancies. This process allowed for the accurate identification and categorization of inappropriate or inaccurate content within the responses.Results There were a total of 382 unique prompts, with 1146 total responses across three iterations of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, GPT-4.0 with Internet). 19.8% of the responses were labeled as inappropriate, with GPT-3.5 accounting for the highest percentage at 25.7% while GPT-4.0 and GPT-4.0 with internet performing comparably at 16.2% and 17.5% respectively. Interestingly, 11.8% of responses were deemed appropriate with GPT-3.5 but inappropriate in updated models, highlighting the ongoing need to evaluate evolving LLMs.Conclusion The red-teaming exercise underscored the benefits of interdisciplinary efforts, as this collaborative model fosters a deeper understanding of the potential limitations of LLMs in healthcare and sets a precedent for future red teaming events in the field. Additionally, we present all prompts and outputs as a benchmark for future LLM model evaluations.1-2 Sentence Description As a proof-of-concept, we convened an interactive “red teaming” workshop in which medical and technical professionals stress-tested popular large language models (LLMs) through publicly available user interfaces on clinically relevant scenarios. Results demonstrate a significant proportion of inappropriate responses across GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, and GPT-4.0 with Internet (25.7%, 16.2%, and 17.5%, respectively) and illustrate the valuable role that non-technical clinicians can play in evaluating models."

In this study, we characterize the fundus microvasculature among 8467 healthy individuals, aged 40-70 years. We employ a fully automated segmentation tool to calculate 12 distinct vessel measures, including tortuosity density, vessel density, average width, fractal dimension, distance tortuosity, and curvature tortuosity for both arteries and veins. We provide reference values for these measures by age and sex, and explore the associations between these fundus vessel measures and various clinical features. Our analysis reveals numerous significant correlations, including connections between fundus arterial measures and cardiovascular measurements, lipid profile, sleep apnea indices, glycemic profile, body composition, and smoking status. This comprehensive analysis of fundus microvasculature anatomy in a large healthy population contributes to the growing field of oculomics and highlights the potential of fundus imaging for earlier detection and monitoring of systemic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases and sleep disorders."

IVIM test-retest scans were acquired in the cervical cord (C1-C3) of 10 healthy subjects on a 3T MRI scanner, with a 15-minute break in-between. IVIM parameters, including microvascular volume fraction (F), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*), blood flow-related coefficient (F · D*), and diffusion coefficient (D), were derived using voxel-wise and region of interest (ROI)-wise fits. The reliability of each IVIM parameter was determined with coefficients of variation (CV), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Bland-Altman analysis and linear regression. To assess the effects of the different fitting approaches, a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the CVs calculated across fitting algorithms. Mean CVs of IVIM parameters calculated across subjects using the voxel-wise fit was lower in the white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) (2.6% to 15.6%; 2.2% to 16.4%, respectively) compared with those calculated using the ROI-wise fit approach (WM: 4.5%-32.2%; GM: 3.4%-53.4%). The voxel-wise fit in the WM yielded higher ICC values (good-to-excellent, 0.71 – 0.97) compared to the ROI-wise fit approach (0.49 – 0.90). IVIM parameters, derived using the voxel-wise fitting approach, demonstrated a high reliability in the cervical cord. Robust IVIM metrics, observed across scans and subjects, can facilitate studies targeting perfusion impairment and pave the way to future clinical trials assessing perfusion impairment as a potential quantitative biomarker."

With a median follow-up of 12.3 years, we assessed the risk of new-onset cardiometabolic diseases in participants stratified by statin usage with Cox proportional hazards models. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization MR analyses to test causal relationship between genetically predicted Lp(a) and T2D and NAFLD.Results Taking the participants with Lp(a) within reportable range as the reference group, the hazard ratios (HR) for T2D were 1.06 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.01-1.12) and for NAFLD 1.35 (95% CI 1.26-1.45) respectively for participants with very low Lp(a) (<3.8 nmol/L). The risk for new-onset T2D was higher in participants using statin (adjusted HR 1.14; 95% CI 1.05-1.24). This was contrasted by higher risk of NAFLD in participants not on statin (HR 1.40; 95%CI 1.28-1.53). There was no evidence for causal links between genetically predicted Lp(a) and T2D nor NAFLD in two-sample MR analyses.Conclusions Very low Lp(a) was associated with higher risks of T2D and NAFLD in a prospective analysis of the UK Biobank. These associations were influenced by lipid lowering medication usage. MR analyses did not support causality for these inverse associations."

This study characterized the genetic architecture of the biological age gap (BAG) across nine human organ systems in 377,028 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. We discovered 393 genomic loci-BAG pairs (P-value<5x10-8) linked to the brain, eye, cardiovascular, hepatic, immune, metabolic, musculoskeletal, pulmonary, and renal systems. We observed BAG-organ specificity and inter-organ connections. Genetic variants associated with the nine BAGs are predominantly specific to the respective organ system while exerting pleiotropic effects on traits linked to multiple organ systems. A gene-drug-disease network confirmed the involvement of the metabolic BAG-associated genes in drugs targeting various metabolic disorders. Genetic correlation analyses supported Cheverud’s Conjecture1 – the genetic correlation between BAGs mirrors their phenotypic correlation. A causal network revealed potential causal effects linking chronic diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease), body weight, and sleep duration to the BAG of multiple organ systems. Our findings shed light on promising therapeutic interventions to enhance human organ health within a complex multi-organ network, including lifestyle modifications and potential drug repositioning strategies for treating chronic diseases.

While, TB is declared as one of the major causes for AIDS-associated mortality. So there is a dire need for new drugs to combat such ailments that have a synergistic interaction.This has led us to study a novel antibiotic purified from a marine Streptomyces sp isolated from the coral reef ecosystem of South Indian coast. Streptomyces sp. R2 (MTCC 5597; DSM 26035)., isolated from the marine water was grown on agar plates and the crude yellowish orange pigment secreted was extracted using various solvents. The antibiotic, named as Transitmycin, was purified and tested against M. tuberculosis, drug resistant strains, and M. tuberculosis biofilm. The compound was also tested against HIV-1 viruses belonging to six subtypes. Several characterisation tools were used to elucidate the structure of this novel antibiotic. Transitmycin was derivitaised to elucidate the absolute configurations of the amino acids present in it. Tr, unlike actinomycin D, has L-valine in both the rings instead of D-valine (found in the latter). Also, one of the proline in Tr is in D–configuration while it is in L configuration in actinomycin D suggesting that ours is a novel compound and is not reported so far. It exhibits dual activities against the standard H37Rv, 49 drug sensitive clinical isolates, and MtB biofilm as well as standard and 20 clinical isolates of HIV. This is the first paper that reports the isolation of a new antibiotic from marine actinobacteria exhibiting unusual anti-TB and HIV activities which could be exploited further as a lead molecule in the quest for the design of drug with dual activities.HighlightsA novel antibiotic was purified from a marine Streptomyces sp isolated from the coral reef of S. IndiaPresence of L-valine, not observed in actinomycin D, and one of the proline in D configuration suggest that it is a novel structure not reported beforeIt exhibits activity against standard MtB strain as well as clinical isolates and drug resistance onesIt exhibits anti-HIV activity against several clinical isolates"

The relationship between sleep quality and cognitive performance was estimated using generalized additive models. Objective sleep was measured with the GT9X Link Actigraph, and self-reported sleep was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.Results We found that females exhibited stable performance of executive function with up to about 400 minutes of total sleep time, with significant declines in performance (p = 0.02) when total sleep time was longer. Additionally, a longer total sleep time contributed to lower verbal memory in a slightly non-linear manner (p = 0.03). Higher self-reported sleep complaints were associated with poorer executive function in females with normal cognition (p = 0.02). In males, a positive linear relationship emerged between sleep efficiency and executive function (p = 0.04), while self-reported sleep was not associated with cognitive performance in males with normal cognition.Conclusions Our findings suggest that the relationships between sleep quality and cognition differ between older males and females, with executive function being the most influenced by objective and self-reported sleep. Interventions targeting sleep quality to mitigate cognitive decline in older adults may need to be tailored according to sex, with distinct approaches for males and females.Statement of Significance This research is significant as it addresses the gap in a previously underexplored area of sex differences in the interplay between sleep quality and cognitive function in older populations. By examining both objective and self-reported sleep measures across three cognitive domains, the study provides valuable insights into how sleep impacts various cognitive domains differently in older males and females. Notably, the findings suggest that interventions to improve sleep quality and potentially mitigate cognitive decline may need to be sex-specific."

However, there is little known about its impact in reducing HIV infection rates in Nigeria. This review aims to assess the impact of the use of HIV self-testing on the incidence of HIV infections in the country.Methods This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies conducted in Nigeria on HIV self- testing with or without comparison to other HIV tests were included. The primary outcomes considered were the detection rate of new HIV cases and the acceptability (uptake) rate for HIV self-testing. Secondary outcomes were the usability rate, repeat testing rate, willingness rate, awareness rate, incidence of social harm, and incidence of high-risk behaviour. Electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library) and Google Scholar were searched for relevant studies. Searches were conducted till December 2, 2023. Pooled estimates were calculated using a random-effects model with the DerSimonian Laird method. Heterogeneity was analyzed using the I2 test, and risk of bias was assessed with the Hoy and colleagues’ scale. Meta-analysis was conducted where possible. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023479752).Results Eight studies, encompassing 7,556 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The overall risk of bias for the included studies was adjudged low. The detection rate of HIV self-testing for new HIV cases was 25.78% (95% CI: 0.90-50.66, I2:100.0), acceptability (uptake) rate was 56.92% (95% CI: 26.54-87.30, I2:100.0), and repeat testing rate was 20.10% (95% CI: -11.44-51.65, I2:100.0). Usability rate, willingness rate, awareness rate, and incidence of high-risk behaviour were reported in one study respectively, with no information on the incidence of social harm. Sensitivity analysis was done, and subgroup analyses could not be estimated due to insufficient data.Conclusions The use of HIV self-testing test kits in Nigeria showed a high detection rate of new HIV cases, moderate acceptability, but low repeat testing rates. However, the evidence is limited. Larger, higher-quality studies are essential to explore the broader impact of HIV self-testing on reducing HIV incidence in Nigeria."

Keratometric values and demographic data were collected for eligible patients who had undergone phacoemulsification and Extracapsular Cataract Extraction using a non-contact Auto Refkeratometer BARK-80.Results A total of 215 patients were recruited for the study. There were 129 (60%) females and 86 (40%) males. The mean age was 67.481 (SD 10.79years). A total 110 patients had undergone phacoemulsification and 105 had undergone Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE). 189 (87.91%), had a magnitude greater or equal (≥) to 0.5 post OP astigmatism. The mean corneal astigmatism among all patients undergone ECCE were 2.29D (SD 1.41 D) and all undergone PHACO were 0.95D (SD 0.79 D). The mean astigmatism among patients who had cataract surgery done by specialist were 1.19D (SD 0.09 D) and 2.41D (SD 0.16 D) were done by residents There was no astigmatism in 7 patients (3.26%), with-the-rule (WTR) in 68 patients (31.63%), against-the-rule (ATR) in 112 patients (52.09%) and oblique astigmatism (OA) in 28 patients (13.02%). The tendency of a gradual change from with the rule (WTR) to against the rule (ATR) astigmatism was noted as the age advanced.Conclusion The present study reveals the magnitude of astigmatism is higher in patients underwent Extra Capsular Cataract Extraction than Phacoemulsification in eye department at KCMC hospital and pre-existing astigmatism is a cause of surgical induced astigmatism if pre- operative astigmatism correction is not taken into consideration."

Two actionable variants in these genes have reached much higher frequencies than in cosmopolitan UK populations. Here, we report a BRCA2 splice acceptor variant, c.517-2A>G, found in breast and ovarian cancer families from Shetland. We investigated the frequency and origin of this variant in a population-based research cohort of people of Shetland ancestry, VIKING I. The variant segregates with female breast and ovarian cancer in diagnosed cases and is classified as pathogenic. Exome sequence data from 2,108 participants with three or more Shetlandic grandparents in VIKING I was used to estimate the population prevalence of c.517-2A>G in Shetlanders. Nine VIKING I research volunteers carry this variant, on a shared haplotype (carrier frequency 0.4%). This frequency is ∼130-fold higher than in UK Biobank, where the small group of carriers has a different haplotype. Records of birth, marriage and death indicate genealogical linkage of VIKING I carriers to a founder from the Isle of Whalsay, Shetland, similar to our observations for the BRCA1 founder variant from Westray, Orkney. In total, 93.5% of pathogenic BRCA variant carriers in Northern Isles exomes are accounted for by these two drifted variants. We thus provide the scientific evidence of an opportunity for screening people of Orcadian and Shetlandic origins for each drifted pathogenic variant, particularly women with Westray or Whalsay ancestry."

Imaging plays a central role in diagnosis and monitoring. Monitoring for progression however, can be repetitive for neuroradiologists, and this has led to interest in automated lesion detection. Simultaneously, in the computer science field of Remote Sensing, Change Detection (CD), the identification of change between co-registered images at different times, has been disrupted by the emergence of Vision Transformers. CD offers an alternative to semantic segmentation leveraging the temporal information in the data.Methods In this retrospective study with external validation we reframe the clinical radiology task of new lesion identification as a CD problem. Consecutive patients who had MRI studies for MS at our institution between 2019 and 2022 were reviewed and those with new lesion(s) were included. External data was obtained from the MSSEG2 challenge and OpenMS. Multiple CD models, and a novel model (NeUFormer), were trained and tested. Results were analysed on both paired slices and at the patient level. Expected Cost (EC) and F2 were independently and prospectively chosen as our primary evaluation metrics. For external data we report DICE and F1 to allow for comparison with existing data. For each test set 1000 bootstrapping simulations were performed by sampling 10 patient samples with replacement giving a non parametric estimate of the confidence interval. Wilcoxon statistics were calculated to test for significance.Findings 43,440 MR images were included for analysis (21,720 pairs). The internal set comprised of 170 patients (110 for training, 30 for tuning, 30 testing) with 120 females and 50 males, average age of 42 (range 21 – 74). 60 (40 + 20) patients were included for external validation.In the CD experiments (2D) our proposed NeuFormer model achieved the best (lowest) Expected Cost (EC) (p=0.0095), the best F2 and second best DICE (p<0.0001). At the patient level our NeUFormer model had the joint highest number of True Positive lesions, and lowest number of False negatives (p<0.002). For CD on external data, NeUFormer achieved the highest DICE on both datasets (p<0.0001). NeUFormer had the lowest or joint lowest number of False Positives on external data (p<0.0001 in all cases).Interpretation Reformulating new lesion identification as a CD problem allows the use of new techniques and methods of evaluation. We introduce a novel Siamese U-Transformer, NeUFormer, which combines concepts from U-Net, Siamese Networks, and vision transformers to create a model with improved small lesion detection and the consistently best EC. Its ability to increase detection of small lesions, balanced with relatively few false positives, and superior generalisability has the potential to greatly impact the field of the identification of radiologic progression of MS with AI.Evidence before this study Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chronic and idiopathic demyelinating disorder of the CNS, is diagnosed using the McDonald criteria based on MRI interpretation. Without a definitive MS biomarker, AI holds promise is for uncovering unique features indicative of MS, improving diagnostics and identifying progression. Research in the field typically centres on segmentation and classification, leaving a gap in evaluating temporal imaging changes. The MSSEG2 challenge has now enabled more research into new lesion identification in MS. Even so, most solutions are based on semantic segmentation architectures and rely on limited metrics for evaluation. The identification of small lesions also remains a challenge.Remote Sensing (RS) is the science of obtaining information about objects or areas from a distance, typically from aircraft or satellites. In the RS literature, Change Detection (CD) refers to the identification of significant alterations in co-registered images captured at different times. In this way CD offers an alternative to semantic segmentation leveraging the temporal information in the data. This field was dominated by convolutional neural networks but has recently been disrupted by transformer-based architectures. Transformers, fuelled by their success in NLP, are gaining popularity across all computer vision tasks due to their larger effective receptive field and enhanced context modelling between image pixels. Inspired by these developments, we incorporate some of these ideas into our NeUFormer model.Added value of this study This study redefines the task of identifying progression on MRI brain in MS as a CD problem, borrowing concepts from RS. This approach allows for both pixel- and patient-level evaluation and rethinks standard metrics to suit specific clinical needs. This acknowledges the distinction between trivial variation in segmentation and clinically significant change. State-of-the-art CD models are assessed at this task, and a novel model, NeuFormer, is introduced. NeuFormer synergistically combines concepts from the classical U-Net (which was originally intended for brain segmentation), Siamese architecture adaptations specifically for CD, Swin-UNETR (a U-Transformer developed by MONAI to integrate the shifting window structure of the Swin transformer into medical imaging) and ChangeFormer which also uses attention at scale specifically for CD, leveraging improved spaciotemporal reasoning to create a model which is better for small lesion identification and with the consistently lowest EC associated with its decisions.Implications of all the available evidence Reframing lesion identification as CD enables an alternative to semantic segmentation leveraging the temporal information in the data, enhancing the model’s relevance and customization for specific medical tasks. We also propose the flexible Expected Cost metric, as it facilitates varying action thresholds and helps to customise tools to stakeholder preferences.Siamese vision transformers show promise for CD on MRI in MS including for smaller lesions which are traditionally difficult for computer vision models to identify. This may be to the intrinsic spaciotemporal advantages of vision transformers, with positional embedding, over patch based convolutional methods.NeUFormer’s ability to increase detection of small lesions, balanced with relatively few false positives and excellent generalisability has the potential to greatly impact the field of the identification of radiologic progression of MS with AI."

These rehabilitation protocols do not consider the individual differences in the Achilles tendon (AT) characteristics, which are crucial in creating the optimal strain environment that promotes healing. While previous research suggests an optimal strain for AT regeneration (6% tendon strains), it is still unclear if the current rehabilitation protocols meet this condition. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate the influence of a selection of rehabilitation exercises on strains in patients with Achilles tendinopathy using subject-specific finite element (FE) models of the free AT. Secondly, the study aimed to explain the influence of muscle forces and material properties on the AT strains. The 21 FE models of the AT included the following subject-specific features: geometry estimated from 3D freehand ultrasound images, Elastic modulus estimated from the experimental stress-strain curve, and muscle forces estimated using a combination of 3D motion capture and musculoskeletal modelling. These models were used to determine tendon strain magnitudes and distribution patterns in the mid-portion of the AT. The generalized ranking suggested a progression of exercises to gradually increase the strains in the mid-portion of the AT, starting from the concentric and eccentric exercises and going to more functional exercises, which impose a higher load on the AT: bilateral heel rise (0.031 ± 0.010), bilateral heel drop (0.034 ± 0.009), unilateral heel drop (0.066 ± 0.023), walking (0.069 ± 0.020), unilateral heel drop with flexed knee (0.078 ± 0.023), and bilateral hopping (0.115 ± 0.033). Unilateral heel drop and walking exercises were not significantly different and they both fell within the optimal strain range. However, when examining individual strains, it became evident that there was diversity in exercise rankings among participants, as well as exercises falling within the optimal strain range. Furthermore, the strains were influenced more by the subject-specific muscle forces compared to the material properties. Our study demonstrated the importance of tailored rehabilitation protocols that consider not only individual subject-specific morphological and material characteristics but especially subject-specific muscle forces. These findings make a significant contribution to shape future rehabilitation protocols with a foundation in biomechanics."

Clinical series suggest impaired cardiometabolic features including hypertension in UFs. We investigated potential genetic links between blood pressure (BP), several cardiometabolic traits and events and UFs.Methods We used summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for UFs and 18 traits related to BP and cardio-metabolism. We applied linkage disequilibrium score regression to estimate genetic correlations and GCTA-mtCOJO for adjusted correlations. Univariate and bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) were used to test causal associations with UFs. We computed inverse variance-weighted. Weighted median estimation and MR-Egger regression were computed for sensitivity analyses. Multiple testing was addressed by Bonferroni correction.Results UFs significantly correlated with systolic (rg=0.08, P=8.7×10−5) and diastolic (rg=0.12, P=8.2×10−8) BP, including after adjustment on body mass index (BMI). UFs positively corelated with BMI (rg=0.11, P=4.1×10−4), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (rg=0.09, P=7.3×10−3), diabetes (rg=0.15, P=1.9×10−5) and triglycerides (TG) (rg=0.17, P=7.6×10−7). We identified a negative correlation with sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (rg=-0.16, P=3×10−4), a marker of bio-availability of sex-steroids. We found no evidence for shared genetics with vascular diseases, except migraine (rg=0.08, P=5.8×10−7). MR analyses supported BMI, WHR, TG and SHBG, to causally associate with increased risk for UFs.Conclusions Our study shows that UFs share substantial genetic basis with traits related to BP, obesity, diabetes, in addition to migraine, a predominantly female vascular condition. We provide MR-based evidence for central obesity, visceral fat traits and sex-steroids bio-availability as relevant genetic risk factors for UFs."

This percentage rises to one quarter and one half in same-sex couples and women aged over 45 years respectively.Study design, size, duration This study uses population-based Australian clinical registry data comprising 9,384 embryo transfer cycles that occurred between 2015 and 2021.Participants/materials, setting, methods Three prediction models were compared that incorporated patient characteristics, but differed in whether they considered use of prior autologous treatment factors and current treatment parameters. We evaluated the models using grouped cross validation and report several measures of model discrimination and calibration. Variable importance was measured through calculating the change in predictive performance that resulted from variable permutation.Main results and the role of chance The best performing model has an AUC-ROC of 0.60 and Brier score of 0.20. While this indicates approximately 15% less discriminatory ability compared to models assessed on an autologous cohort from the same population the performance of the models was clearly statistically significantly better than random and well calibrated to the population studied. The most important variables for predicting the chance of a live birth were the oocyte donor age, number of prior oocyte recipient embryo transfer cycles and whether the transferred embryo was cleavage or blastocyst stage. Of lessor importance were the oocyte recipient parity, whether donor or partner sperm was used, the number of prior autologous embryo transfer cycles and the number of embryos transferred.Limitations, reasons for caution The variation in donor oocyte cohorts across countries due to differences in whether anonymous and compensated donation are allowed may necessitate the models be re-calibrated prior to application in non-Australian cohorts.Wider implications of the findings These results confirm the well-established importance of oocyte age and ART treatment history as the key prognostic factors in predicting treatment outcomes.

This occurs despite repeated policy directives to provide patients and community with health information that is easy to understand and that applies health literacy principles. This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sydney Health Literacy Lab (SHeLL) Health Literacy Editor, an easy-to-use online plain language tool that supports health information providers to apply health literacy guidelines to written health information.Design Randomised controlled trial with analysts blind to intervention group.Setting Online study, AustraliaParticipants 188 health information providers with no previous experience using the Health Literacy Editor (mean age 41.0 (SD=11.6); 154 female (85%)).Intervention Participants were provided access to the Health Literacy Editor and a 30-minute online training program prior to editing three pre-specified health texts. The Health Literacy Editor gives objective, real-time, and fine-grained feedback on words and sentences. Control participants were asked to revise the texts using their own standard health information development processes.Main outcome measure Pre-registered primary outcome was text grade reading score (using validated instrument, the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook). Secondary outcomes were use of complex language (% of the text) and passive voice (number of instances), subjective expert ratings (Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool), and acceptability ratings (System Usability Scale; Technology Acceptance Model).Results Texts revised in the intervention group had significantly improved grade reading scores relative to control (Mean Difference (MD)=2.48, 95% CI=1.84 to 3.12, p<0.001, d=0.99), lower text complexity (MD=6.86, 95% CI=4.99 to 8.74, p<0.001, d=0.95) and less passive voice (MD=0.95, 95% CI=0.4 to 1.5, p<0.001, d=0.53) in intention-to-treat analyses. Experts rated texts in the intervention group more favourably for word choice and style than those in the control group (MD=0.44, 95% CI=0.25 to 0.63, p<0.001, d=0.63), with no loss of meaning or content. Participants rated the Health Literacy Editor an acceptable product (71.0/100, SD=13.7) that was useful (3.8/5, SD=0.7) and easy to use (4.0/5, SD=0.6).Conclusions and relevance The Health Literacy Editor helped users simplify health information and apply health literacy guidelines to written text. It has high potential to improve development of health information for people who have low health literacy. As an online tool the Health Literacy Editor is also easy to access and implement at scale.Trial registration ACTRN12623000386639Section 1: What is already known on this topic?Most health information is hard for people to understand, particularly those who are older, with less education, or who speak English as a second language.Systematic reviews show that texts that follow health literacy guidelines (e.g. use simpler words, shorter sentences and active voice) are easier for people to understand and recall.There are few automated tools that guide development of easy-to-understand written health information and none that have been rigorously evaluated in a randomised controlled trial.Section 2: What this study addsParticipants who used the Health Literacy Editor were able to more effectively simplify health information compared to participants in the control group.On average participants in the intervention group produced texts suitable for a person with almost 2.5 fewer years of school education compared to those in the control group. Similar patterns were observed for complex language and passive voice.The Health Literacy Editor is an effective tool to support development of written health information that adheres to plain language principles. It can be used in clinical and non-clinical settings and implemented at scale."

However, the neural mechanisms underlying apraxic deficits in AD remain elusive. Therefore, the current study focuses on the association between altered functional connectivity and apraxia in individuals with AD examining the hypothesis that apraxic deficits in AD result from dysfunction in praxis-related networks.To this aim, we examined the association between changes in static and dynamic functional connectivity (FC) of resting-state networks and apraxia in AD. Resting-state functional MRI data was acquired in 13 patients with tau-and amyloid-positive AD, who underwent an extensive neuropsychological, motor and apraxia assessment, and 13 matched healthy control participants. The static and dynamic functional connectivity of resting state networks revealed by independent component analysis (ICA) were assessed and connectivity measures were correlated with apraxia scores.Across all participants, we identified two distinct dynamic FC states using a sliding window approach. Patients with AD exhibited prolonged dwell times in the first state characterized by weaker connectivity and spent overall more time in this state, i.e., showed an increased fraction time in the first state. Apraxic deficits, especially deficits in imitating gestures, correlated significantly with the fraction time of both states as well as with the dwell time of the weakly connected dynamic state.Data suggest that apraxic imitation deficits in AD are associated with dysfunction of praxis networks characterized by altered dynamic FC."

Unfortunately, SOT recipients are also poor responders to the key medical intervention to preventing infection: vaccines. Here we performed a systems vaccinology study on a cohort of 59 kidney transplant recipients and 31 lung transplant recipients who received the mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Analyzing the immunological status of the patients prior to vaccination, we were able to identify multiple immunological associates of relatively improved vaccine responses following two or three doses of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. These immunological associates predicted, with 95.0% and 93.3% accuracy, vaccine response after the second and third dose, respectively. Comparison of the immunological associates with vaccine response in SOT recipients revealed two distinct immune configurations: a non-classical configuration, distinct from the immune state of healthy subjects, associated with responses to two doses of mRNA vaccine and that could be mediated partly by the presence of double negative B cell subsets which are more prominently represented in responsive SOT recipients, and a “normalized” configuration, closer to the immune state of healthy subjects, associated with potent antibody responses to three doses of mRNA vaccine. These results suggest that immunosuppression in SOT recipients can result in distinct immune states associated with different trade-offs in vaccine responsiveness. Immune phenotyping of SOT recipients for immune constellation may be an effective approach for identifying patients most at risk of poor vaccine responses and susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases.One-sentence summary SOT recipients showed distinct immune states at baseline associated with different profiles of vaccine-associated immune response."

One specific application of PGSs is the development and potential use of pharmacogenomic- scores (PGx-scores) to identify patients who can benefit from a specific medication or are likely to experience side effects. This systematic review comprehensively evaluates published PGx-score studies in psychiatry and provides insights into their potential clinical use and avenues for future development. A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases until 22 August 2023. This review included fifty-three primary studies, of which the majority (69.8%) were conducted using samples of European ancestry. We found that over 90% of PGx-scores in psychiatry have been developed based on psychiatric and medical diagnoses or trait variants, rather than pharmacogenomic variants. Among these PGx-scores, the polygenic score for schizophrenia (PGSSCZ) has been most extensively studied in relation to its impact on treatment outcomes (32 publications). Twenty (62.5%) of these studies suggest that individuals with higher PGSSCZ have negative outcomes from psychotropic treatment: poorer treatment response, higher rates of treatment resistance, more antipsychotic-induced side effects, or more psychiatric hospitalizations, while the remaining studies didn’t find significant associations. Although PGx-scores alone accounted for at best 5.6% of the variance in treatment outcomes (in schizophrenia treatment resistance), together with clinical variables they explained up to 13.7% (in bipolar lithium response), suggesting that clinical translation might be achieved by including PGx-scores in multivariable models. In conclusion, our literature review found that there are still very few studies developing PGx-scores using pharmacogenomic variants. Research with larger and diverse populations is required to develop clinically relevant PGx-scores, using biology-informed and multi- phenotypic polygenic scoring approaches, as well as by integrating clinical variables with these scores to facilitate their translation to psychiatric practice."

As a result, their medial gastrocnemius is commonly affected and is characterized by altered macro and microscopic muscular alterations. At the macroscopic level, the muscle volume (MV), anatomical cross-sectional area of the muscle belly (Belly-CSA), muscle belly length (ML), and the intrinsic muscle quality are reduced. At the microscopic level, the cross-sectional area of the fiber (Fiber-CSA) is characterized by an increased within-patient variability (coefficient of variation (CV)), the fiber type proportion is altered and capillarization is reduced. However, the relations between the muscular alterations at the macro- and microscopic level are not yet known. Therefore, this cross-sectional study integrated macro- and microscopic parameters of the medial gastrocnemius in one cohort of young ambulant children with CP and age-matched TD children, and explored how deficits in macroscopic muscle size are associated with alterations at the microscopic level. A group of 46 children with CP (median age 5.4 (3.3) years) and a control group of 34 TD children (median age 6.3 (3.4) years), who had data on microscopic muscular properties (defined through the histological analyses of muscle biopsies), as well as macroscopic muscle properties (defined by 3D freehand ultrasound) were included. We defined Pearson or Spearman correlations, depending on the data distribution. The macroscopic muscle size parameters (MV, Belly-CSA, ML) showed significant moderate correlations (0.504-0.592) with the microscopic average Fiber-CSA in TD and CP. To eliminate the common effect of anthropometric growth at the macro- as well as microscopic level, the data were expressed as deficits (i.e. z-scores from normative centile curves or means) or were normalized to body size parameters. A significant but low correlation was found between the z-scores of MV with the z-scores of the Fiber-CSA (r=0.420, p=0.006). The normalized muscle parameters also showed only low correlations between the macro- and microscopic muscle size parameters, namely between Belly-CSA and Fiber-CSA, both in the TD (r=0.408, p=0.023) and the CP (ρ=0.329, p=0.041) group. Explorations between macroscopic muscle parameters and other microscopic muscle parameters (capillary density, capillary to fiber ratio, and fiber type proportion) revealed no or only low correlations. These results highlighted the complexity of the interacting network of intrinsic muscle structures, with mainly low associations between the macro- and microstructural level, and it remains unclear how alterations in microscopic muscle structures contribute to the macroscopic muscle size deficits in children with CP."

Profiling the adaptive immune response following infection in children is essential to better understand and characterize these differences.Methods Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses from unvaccinated pediatric and adult participants were analyzed following asymptomatic or mild non-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection. Levels of IgG and IgA targeting spike (S), receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were measured, while neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers were assessed against three viral strains (Wuhan, Omicron BA.1 and BA.4/BA.5). Specific T-cell memory responses were investigated by quantifying interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) secreting cells after stimulation with ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2, and seasonal human β- coronaviruses (HCoV)-OC43 and -HKU1.Results The study comprised 28 children (3 to 17 [median=10] years old) and 28 adults (19 to 62 [median=42]). At a mean time of seven months (± 2.8 months) after SARS-CoV-2 infection, children and adults mounted comparable antibody levels against S and RBD, as well as similar neutralization capacity. However, children displayed a weaker cellular memory response to SARS- CoV-2 than adults, with a median of 88 [28-184] spot forming units per million of PBMCs in children compared to 208 [141-340] in adults (***, P < .001). In children, the level of IFN-γ secreting cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 corresponds to that of seasonal coronaviruses.Conclusion Long-term memory T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are enhanced in adults compared to children who demonstrate equivalent responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other HCoV.HIGHLIGHTSChildren infected with SARS-CoV-2 show comparable binding and neutralizing antibody levels as adults seven months after infection.There are notable differences in the intensity of the T-cell response following SARS-CoV- 2 infection between children and adults.Children have more pronounced T-cell immunodominance towards the spike versus non- spike proteins compared to adults at seven months post-infectionIn contrast, T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are globally reduced in children compared to adults but are alike to other seasonal β-coronaviruses."

MS treatment strategies aim to limit WML accumulation and disability progression. It is commonly accepted that nutrition is one of the possible environmental factors involved in the pathogenesis of MS, but its role as a complementary MS treatment is unclear and, to a large extent, ignored.Objective A pilot case control study over a 10 year period to ascertain whether a dietary- and lifestyle modification Program in pwMS reduces or prevents WML formation.Methods MRI was performed at baseline and after an interval period of at least 10 years or longer in 22 pwMS. WML volumes were determined using Sequence Adaptive Multimodal SEGmentation (SAMSEG) software, part of FreeSurfer 7.2. Other variables include age at MRI, disease duration, disability status and medication.Results PwMS (n=13) who had followed the Program for more than 10 years, had significantly smaller lesion volumes (mm3) compared to pwMS who did not adhere to the Program (n=9) (4950 ± 5303 vs 17934 ± 11139; p=0.002). WML volumes were significantly associated (p=0.02) with disability (EDSS) but not with age (p=0.350), disease duration (p=0.709), or Interferon-β treatment (p=0.70).Conclusion Dietary- and lifestyle changes may lower the risk of developing cerebral WMLs in pwMS and potentially slow down disease progression. Larger studies are required to confirm the effectiveness of such interventions in pwMS."

Here, we elucidate the contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the racial disparities and their potential clinical applications in both diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. AA patients had elevated plasma levels of MALAT1 and PVT1 compared with cancer-free smokers. Incorporating these lncRNAs as plasma biomarkers, along with smoking history, achieved 81% accuracy in diagnosis of lung cancer in AA patients. We observed a rise in MALAT1 expression, correlating with increased levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and CD68, CD163, CD206, indicative of tumor-associated macrophages in lung tumors of AA patients. Forced MALAT1 expression led to enhanced growth and invasiveness of lung cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by elevated levels of MCP-1, CD68, CD163, CD206, and KI67. Mechanistically, MALAT1 acted as a competing endogenous RNA to directly interact with miR-206, subsequently affecting MCP-1 expression and macrophage activity, and enhanced the tumorigenesis. Targeting MALAT1 significantly reduced tumor sizes in animal models. Therefore, dysregulated MALAT1 contributes to lung cancer disparities in AAs by modulating the tumor immune microenvironment through its interaction with miR-206, thereby presenting novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets."

A systematic review","AbstractIntroduction Environmental health services (e.g., water, sanitation, hygiene, cleaning, waste management) in healthcare facilities are important to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems, but coverage gaps remain. The World Health Organization and United Nations Children’s Fund developed WASH FIT, a quality improvement tool, to help assess and improve environmental health services. Fifty-three countries have adopted it. However, there is little evidence of its effectiveness. This systematic review evaluates whether WASH FIT improves environmental health services or associated health outcomes and impacts.Methods We conducted database searches to identify relevant studies and extracted data on study design, healthcare facility characteristics, and inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts associated with WASH FIT. We summarized the findings using a logic model framework and narrative synthesis.Results We included 31 studies in the review. Most inputs and activities were described qualitatively. Twenty-three studies reported quantitative outputs, primary WASH FIT indicator scores, and personnel trained on WASH FIT. Nine studies reported longitudinal data demonstrating changes in these outputs throughout WASH FIT implementation. Six studies reported quantitative outcomes measurements; the remainder described outcomes qualitatively or not at all. Common outcomes included allocated funding for environmental health services, community engagement, and government collaboration, changes in knowledge, attitudes, or practices among healthcare staff, patients, or community members, and policy changes. No studies directly measured impacts or evaluated WASH FIT against a rigorous control group.Conclusions Available evidence is insufficient to evaluate WASH FIT’s effects on outputs, outcomes, and impacts. Further effort is needed to comprehensively identify the inputs and activities required to implement WASH FIT and to draw specific links between changes in outputs, outcomes, and impacts. Short-term opportunities exist to improve evidence by more comprehensive reporting of WASH FIT assessments and exploiting data on health impacts within health management information systems. In the long term, we recommend experimental studies. This evidence is important to ensure that funding invested for WASH FIT implementation is used cost-effectively and that opportunities to adapt and refine WASH FIT are fully realized as it continues to grow in use and influence.HighlightsWASH FIT is highly influential, but little is known about its effectivenessWe reviewed WASH FIT’s effects on environmental health service outputs and health impactsNine studies measured outputs longitudinally; none directly measured health impactsNo studies compared WASH FIT’s performance against a rigorous control groupEvidence is insufficient to assess WASH FIT’s effects on outputs or health impactsDownload figureOpen in new tab"

We aimed to perform an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of more intensive blood pressure management as compared to less intensive blood pressure management.Methods We searched various electronic databases including Embase, MEDLINE (via PubMed), and CENTRAL to retrieve relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the clinical effects of more intensive blood pressure management after endovascular thrombectomy as compared to the less intensive management. We assessed the risk of bias using the revised Cochrane “Risk of bias” tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0), calculated risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes.Results Our meta-analysis included 4 RCTs with a total of 1560 patients. According to our analysis, more intensive blood pressure management was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the number of patients showing functional independence (modified Rankin scale mRS score=0-2) at 90 days (RR 0.81; CI = 0.72-0.91; I2 = 12%). Regarding 90-day mortality, our pooled results from three RCTs showed no statistically significant difference between the more intensive blood pressure management group and the less intensive blood pressure management group (RR 1.17; CI = 0.90-1.52; I2 = 0%). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (RR 1.05; CI = 0.90-1.23; I2 = 0%) and the incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) (RR 1.10; CI = 0.76-1.60; I2 = 0%).Conclusion According to our meta-analysis, no benefit of intensive lowering of blood pressure was observed in terms of functional independence at 90 days, mortality rates, and incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. Future large-scale trials should focus on other interventions to improve prognosis in these patients."

Women have long been engaged in agricultural production in the region, yet the implications of the shift from food crop production to khat/cash crop production on degree and manner of women’s engagement in agriculture and any related changes in nutrition are largely unstudied. Using longitudinal data collected from December 2020 to June 2022 in Haramaya woreda, East Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia, this study aimed to explore the relationship between women’s engagement in khat production and child nutritional outcomes, and to test whether an increase/decrease in women’s engagement in khat production over time was associated with a change in child nutritional outcomes. Primary outcome variables were child length-for-age z-score (LAZ), child weight-for-age z-score (WAZ), child weight-for-length z-score (WLZ), and child minimum dietary diversity (MDD). Mixed effect models using backward stepwise regression were conducted to assess the relationship between women’s engagement in khat production, child nutrition outcomes, and a set of covariates, including women’s empowerment. No relationship was found between women’s engagement in khat production at baseline and child LAZ, WAZ, or WLZ; however, women’s empowerment was positively associated with child LAZ (β = 0.513, p = 0.004) and child WAZ (β = 0.456, p = 0.010) in this model. Women’s high engagement in khat production over time (first year of child’s life) was negatively associated with child LAZ (β = −0.731, p = 0.033) when compared to those who had low engagement over the same time period; women’s empowerment was positively associated with child LAZ (β = 0.693, p < 0.001) in this model. The findings from this study point to a potentially important dynamic between sustained high levels of women’s engagement in khat production and poor child growth outcomes; and contribute to a growing literature linking women’s empowerment in agriculture to improved child growth outcomes. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between women’s engagement in khat production and women’s empowerment in agriculture."

The association between healthy lifestyle and early-onset cancer and whether it varies by common genetic variants is unknown.Objective To examine the associations between genetic risk, lifestyle, and risk of early-onset cancers.Design, Setting, and Participants We analyzed a prospective cohort of 66,308 white British participants who were under age 50 and free of cancer at baseline in the UK Biobank.Exposures Sex-specific composite total cancer polygenic risk scores (PRSs), a breast cancer-specific PRS, and sex-specific health-associated lifestyle scores (HLSs, which summarize smoking status, body mass index [males only], physical activity, alcohol consumption, and diet).Main Outcomes and Measures Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for early-onset total and breast cancer.Results A total of 1,247 incident invasive early-onset cancer cases (female: 820, male: 427, breast: 386) were documented. In multivariable-adjusted analyses with 2-year latency, higher genetic risk (highest vs. lowest tertile of PRS) was associated with significantly increased risks of early-onset total cancer in females (HR, 95% CI: 1.85, 1.50-2.29) and males (1.94, 1.45-2.59) as well as early-onset breast cancer in females (3.06, 2.20-4.25). An unfavorable lifestyle (highest vs. lowest category of HLS) was associated with higher risk of total cancer and breast cancer in females across genetic risk categories; the association with total cancer was stronger in the highest genetic risk category than the lowest: HRs in females and men were 1.85 (1.02, 3.36), 3.27 (0.78, 13.72) in the highest genetic risk category and 1.15 (0.44, 2.98), 1.16 (0.39, 3.40) in the lowest.Conclusions and Relevance Both genetic and lifestyle factors were independently associated with early-onset total and breast cancer risk. Compared to those with low genetic risk, individuals with a high genetic risk may benefit more from adopting a healthy lifestyle in preventing early-onset cancer."

Kidney transplantion and survival over pandemic subperiods versus the prepandemic period were investigated using longitudinal models with time-dependent covariates. Moreover, the impact of cumulative doses of COVID-19 vaccine on hospitalization and survival were compared between CDR and matched-control individuals.Findings Follow-up of the 71,583 CDR and 143,166 controls totalized 639,341 person-years (CDR: 184,909; controls: 454,432). The likelihood of receiving a kidney transplant decreased during all pandemic subperiods except one. Mortality in CDR increased during the 3 wave subperiods (hazard ratio (HR [95% confidence interval]): 1·19 [1·13–1·27], 1·19 [1·15–1·23], and 1·12 [1·07–1·17], respectively). While vaccine coverage declined with each booster dose, receiving such doses was associated with lower risks of COVID-19-related hospitalization (0·66 [0·56–0·77], 0·83 [0·72–0·94] for 1st booster versus 2nd dose and 2nd booster versus 1st booster, respectively) and death (corresponding HR: 0·55 [0·51–0·59], 0·88 [0·83–0·95]). Evolving patterns in mortality and vaccination outcomes were similar in CDR and controls.Interpretation The impact of the pandemic in CDR was not specific of the kidney disease per se. Study results also suggest future research aimed at increasing adherence to vaccine booster doses."

It recommended screening women aged 30–49, and younger women once they tested HIV-positive. Subsequent WHO guidelines recommended screening women living with HIV (WLHIV) starting at age 25. However, the impact of 2013 guidelines and age to start screening on screening has not been studied.Methods We used a regression discontinuity design (RDD) analysis of population-based data to assess the impact of the 2013 WHO guidelines on the screening rates for women according to HIV status and age group in Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The outcome was self-reported ever having been screened for cervical pre-cancer between 2008 and 2018. We compared the screening rates according to HIV status and age group, before and after age 25 years. And before and after 2014, the year countries adopted the 2013 guidelines. We then used a data-driven optimal bandwidth selection procedure to estimate the guidelines’ average treatment effect (ATE), with a local polynomial regression discontinuity and robust bias-corrected confidence intervals. We validated the RDD methodology overall and for women with a significant ATE at the country-level analysis.Results We included 73179 women: 6680 (9.1%) living with HIV, 4328 (5.9%) with unknown HIV status, and 62171 (85.0) with a negative HIV status. 5726 (7.9%) reported having ever been screened; 4022 (6.5%) with unknown HIV status, 525 (12.1%) with a negative HIV status and 1179 (17.7%) living with HIV. Adolescent girls and young women living with HIV (AGYWLHIV) aged 15–24 reported screening less often (917 (13.7%)) than their peers with unknown (1677 (38.8%)) or positive HIV status (27278 (43.9%)) (P<0.001), or older women. The ATE of screening was 0 for women with unknown or positive HIV status, for whom the RDD was valid.Conclusion We found no evidence the 2013 WHO guidelines increased or reduced women’s cervical pre- cancer screening. However, AGYWLHIV reported screening less often. Policy makers should lower the age to start screening WLHIV from 25 to 15 to screen more AGYWLHIV. Studies are required to examine the impact of the guidelines on cervical pre-cancer screening in more countries."

Although 3HP completion rate is generally ≥ 80%, variations exist depending on type of delivery strategy and programmatic setting. Prior to the roll-out, a mixed methods study was conducted to assess whether a family approach involving family member support, SMS reminders and three health education sessions, was acceptable and optimized 3HP uptake and completion. This paper describes acceptability of the family approach among people living with HIV (PLHIV), treatment supporters (TS) and community health workers (CHWs).Methods This was a qualitative descriptive study in 12 HIV care and treatment centers across six administrative regions. We purposively sampled 20 PLHIV, 12 CHWs for in-depth interviews and 23 TS for three focus group discussions held between September to December, 2023. The theoretical framework of acceptability guided thematic-content analysis using a framework approach.Results Participants understood that PLHIV have high risk for active TB and that 3HP provides shortened treatment for TB disease prevention. They reported gaining TB and 3HP knowledge from health education sessions. However, participation of TS in health education sessions was low and many reported expensive transportation costs to clinics. Receiving support from someone close and SMS were perceived as good adherence reminders. The majority reported mild self-limiting side effects but expressed positive attitudes because of the shortened treatment, TB counselling, satisfaction from helping others, alignment with lifestyle and work responsibilities and reduced work burden. Some PLHIV reported difficulties in identifying family members for support thus, chose other close friends or CHWs.Conclusions Delivery of 3HP with support from family members and SMS reminders is widely accepted by CHWs, PLHIVs and TS. Restricting support from only family members was unacceptable and attendance of all three health education sessions by TS may not be feasible."

Devising cost-effective strategies for managing epidemics amid vaccine uncertainty,"AbstractDuring an infectious disease outbreak, public health policy makers are tasked with strategically implementing control interventions whilst balancing competing objectives. To provide a quantitative framework that can be used to guide these decisions, it is helpful to devise a clear and specific objective function that can be evaluated to determine the optimal outbreak response. In this study, we have developed a mathematical modelling framework representing outbreaks of a novel emerging pathogen for which non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are imposed or removed based on thresholds for hospital occupancy. These thresholds are set at different levels to define four unique control strategies. We illustrate that the optimal intervention strategy is contingent on the choice of objective function. Specifically, the optimal strategy depends on the extent to which policy makers prioritise reducing health costs due to infection over the costs associated with control interventions. Motivated by the scenario early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we incorporate the development of a vaccine into our modelling framework and demonstrate that a policy maker's belief about when a vaccine will become available in future, and its eventual coverage (and/or effectiveness), affects the optimal control strategy to adopt early in the outbreak. Furthermore, we show how uncertainty in these quantities can be accounted for when deciding which interventions to introduce. This research highlights the benefits of policy makers being explicit about the precise objectives of introducing interventions."

We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic profiling to provide a deeper insight into the metabolic changes associated with survival of prenatal famine exposure during the Dutch Famine at the end of World War II and explore their link to disease.Methods NMR metabolomics data were generated from serum in 480 individuals prenatally exposed to famine (mean 58.8 years, 0.5 SD) and 464 controls (mean 57.9 years, 5.4 SD). We tested associations of prenatal famine exposure with levels of 168 individual metabolic biomarkers and compared the metabolic biomarker signature of famine exposure with those of 154 common diseases.Results Prenatal famine exposure was associated with higher concentrations of branched-chain amino acids ((iso)-leucine), aromatic amino acid (tyrosine), and glucose in later life (0.2-0.3 SD, p < 3×10-3). The metabolic biomarker signature of prenatal famine exposure was positively correlated to that of incident type-2 diabetes (r = 0.77, p = 3×10-27), also when re-estimating the signature of prenatal famine exposure among individuals without diabetes (r = 0.67, p = 1×10-18). Remarkably, this association extended to 115 common diseases for which signatures were available (0.3 :< r :< 0.9, p < 3.2×10-4). Correlations among metabolic signatures of famine exposure and disease outcomes were attenuated when the famine signature was adjusted for body mass index.Conclusions Prenatal famine exposure is associated with a metabolic biomarker signature that strongly resembles signatures of a diverse set of diseases, an observation that can in part be attributed to a shared involvement of obesity."

Patients can continue to experience residual cognitive difficulties months to years after the acute illness. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can examine neural changes in the absence of frank structural abnormalities and may help identify factors predicting children at risk of long-term cognitive deficits. We predicted that theta and delta brain functional connectivity networks would be associated with processing speed and working memory in children with autoimmune encephalitis.Participants were children diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis at least 18 months before testing and typically developing children. All completed MEG recording (Elekta Neuromag Triux) at rest, eyes open with a fixation cross during six minutes; T1 MRI scans; and cognitive evaluation using the primary subtests of the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children, fifth edition. Brain connectivity, specifically in delta and theta brain activity, was estimated with amplitude envelope correlation, and network efficiency was measured using graph measures (global efficiency, local efficiency, modularity). The measures were compared across the two groups with permutation correction for multiple thresholds. Finally, statistical associations with processing speed and working memory scores were tested in the autoimmune encephalitis group.Age and sex-matched cohorts of 12 children with AE (11.2±3.5y, IQR 9y; 5M:7F) and 12 typically developing controls (10.6±3.2y, IQR 7y; 8M:4F) participated in this study. On average, children with autoimmune encephalitis did not differ from controls in working memory (t(21)= 1.449; p = .162; d = 0.605) but had a significantly lower processing speed (t(21) = 2.463; p = .023; Cohen’s d = 1.028). The groups did not differ in theta network topology measures but the autoimmune encephalitis group had a significantly lower delta local efficiency across all thresholds tested (d = −1.60 at network threshold 14%). Theta modularity was associated with lower working memory (β = -.781; t(8) = −2.588, p = .032) but this effect did not survive correction for multiple comparisons (p(corr) = .224). No other graph measure was significantly associated with psychometric scores in the autoimmune encephalitis group.MEG was able to capture network alterations in paediatric autoimmune encephalitis patients, specifically in the topological organisation of delta brain activity. This preliminary study demonstrates that MEG is an appropriate tool for assessing children with autoimmune encephalitis; future studies should focus on confirming which functional networks can predict cognitive performance."

Divergent views on drivers of early phase clinical trial participation among ethnically diverse potential trial participants in the United Kingdom: A Mixed Methods Study","AbstractBackground Novel therapeutics should always be tested in a sample representative of the population in need of treatment. Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which don’t generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.Methods A systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.Results The systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers’ and general public’s perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.Discussion These findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies."

Adaptive trials are needed to accelerate the conduct of more efficient, informative, and ethical clinical research in the field of neurology as compared to traditional fixed designs. Stroke is a natural candidate for adoption of these innovative approaches to trial design. This Research Methods in Neurology paper is informed by scoping review that identified 45 completed and ongoing adaptive clinical trials in stroke that were appraised: 14 trials had published results with or without a published protocol, 15 trials had a published protocol, and 16 trials were registered only. Treatments spanned acute (n=28), rehabilitation (n=8), prevention (n=8), and rehabilitation and prevention (n=1) domains. A subsample of these trials were selected to illustrate the utility of adaptive design features and discuss why each adaptive feature(s) were incorporated in the design to best achieve the aim, whether each individual feature was used and if it resulted in expected efficiencies, and any learnings during preparation, conduct or reporting. We then discuss the operational, ethical, and regulatory considerations that warrant careful consideration during adaptive trial planning and reflect on the workforce readiness to deliver adaptive trials in practice. We conclude that adaptive trials can be designed, funded, conducted, and published for a wide range of research questions and offer future directions to support adoption of adaptive trial designs in stroke and neurological research more broadly."

The process consisted of four half-day meetings, developing recommendations within five topical working groups, a series of consensus questionnaires to assess recommendation agreement on a 4-point Likert-like scale, and opportunities for input and feedback throughout the process. Recommendations required at least 75% consensus to be included.Results Our interdisciplinary group—from 26 organizations and 13 countries in five global regions across academia, nonprofit research organizations, the pharmaceutical industry, and funding agencies— developed 44 consensus recommendations. These included recommendations on standardization, patient-reported outcome measure development aligned with current regulatory guidance, trial design, protocol development, participant recruitment, data collection, data analysis, and areas for exploratory research. Seven recommendations were deemed a priority by over 85% of our group.Conclusion Using a formal consensus-building process, we reached high levels of agreement around recommendations for more standardized and patient-centered measurement of CIMCs in contraceptive clinical trials, now and in the future.Implications statement Consensus recommendations on measuring bleeding changes and related outcomes in contraceptive clinical trials can improve reporting of standardized, patient-centered outcomes in future product labeling. These improvements can enable providers to offer more relevant counseling on contraceptives and permit greater comparability and data synthesis across trials to inform clinical guidance."

Concerns about the generalizability of such models to real-world populations due to sampling effects and disparities in available data sources are rising. We examined whether harmonized, structured collection of clinical data and stringent measures against overfitting can facilitate the generalization of machine learning models for predicting depressive symptoms across diverse real-world inpatient and outpatient samples. Despite systematic differences between samples, a sparse machine learning model trained on clinical information exhibited strong generalization across diverse real-world samples. These findings highlight the crucial role of standardized routine data collection, grounded in unified ontologies, in the development of generalizable machine learning models in mental health.One-Sentence Summary Generalization of sparse machine learning models trained on clinical data is possible for depressive symptom prediction."

A cross-sectional study,"ABSTRACTBackground Mental illnesses, like other chronic illnesses, require medications for both immediate, short term and long term treatment. Medication adherence is the first and most important factor for better treatment outcome. Non-adherence to psychotropic medications is associated with relapse, readmission, and early death. The beliefs about medication which influence non-adherence to medications are moderated by specific personality traits. Sociodemographic and clinical factors can also influence non-adherence psychotropic medications. Non-adherence to psychotropic medications is high in Africa but there is paucity of published studies on the level of psychotropic medication non-adherence and associated personality traits in Uganda.Aim To determine the prevalence of psychotropic medication non-adherence and associated personality traits among people with mental illness attending Kampala International University Teaching Hospital (KIU-TH) and Jinja Regional Referral Hospital (JRRH).Methods This study employed a hospital-based cross-sectional design. 396 adult patients suffering from mental illness were collected from KIU-TH and JRRH outpatient clinics. Medication adherence was assessed using Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) while personality traits were assessed by the short form of Big Five Inventory (Ten Items Personality Inventory). We first assessed sociodemographic and clinical factors influencing psychotropic medication non-adherence in our study (confounders). A questionnaire with sociodemographic and clinical information was also used. Logistic regression was used to assess personality traits and other factors associated with psychotropic medication non-adherence.Results The majority of the study participants were males (59.1%), from rural areas (74.2%), with secondary educational level (47.5%) and unemployed (44.9%). The prevalence of psychotropic medication was 46.21%. Poor family support (aOR= 6.915, CI=3.679-12.998, P<0.001), belief in witchcraft/sorcery (aOR=2.959, CI=1.488-5.884, P=0.002), experiencing side effects (aOR=2.257, CI=1.326-3.843, P=0.003), and substance use (aOR=4.174, CI=2.121-8.214, P<0.001) were factors significantly associated with psychotropic medication non-adherence. The personality traits significantly associated with psychotropic medication non-adherence after controlling for the confounders were neuroticism (aOR=7.424, CI=3.890-14.168, P<0.001) and agreeableness (aOR=0.062, CI=0.024-0.160, P<0.001).Conclusion Medication non-adherence was high. Non-adherent patients were more likely to have predominant neuroticism personality traits. Medication non-adherence was shown to be less common in individuals with agreeableness personality traits. Other factors associated with psychotropic medication non-adherence were poor social support, witchcraft beliefs, presence of side effects and substance use. Reinforced psycho-education should be given to patients with high risk of being non-adherent to psychotropic medications."

Random order, open label trial using two manufacturers’ SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow devices concurrently","AbstractObjectives To inform management of competing risks from Covid-19 and key-worker absence, we evaluated whether using two manufacturers’ lateral flow tests (LFTs) concurrently improved SARS-CoV-2 Omicron detection and was acceptable to hospital staff. In a nested study, to understand the risks of return to work after a fixed number of days of isolation or quarantine, we examined virus culture at Days 5-7 after positive test or significant exposure.Methods and Analysis 1419 fully-vaccinated Liverpool (UK) University Hospitals staff participated in a random-order, open-label trial testing whether dual LFTs improved SARS-CoV2 detection, and whether dual swabbing was acceptable to users. Main outcome was self-reported LFT result.Staff enrolled via routine testing sites for symptomatic staff and close contacts. Recruitment took place between 7th February and 8th May 2022. Participants employed nose-throat swab Innova and nose-only swab Orient Gene LFTs for 10 days, with daily LFTs taken in random order. A swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was taken at Day-5 and, if positive, Day-10. A questionnaire on acceptability was administered on exit. Selected participants gave swabs for viral culture on Days 5-7; swabs were delivered and returned by courier. Cultures were considered positive if cytopathic effect was apparent or the SARs-COV2 N gene sub-genomic RNA was detected by sequencing.Results 226 individuals reported 1466 pairs of LFT results. Tests disagreed in 127 cases (8.7%). Orient Gene was more likely (78 cf. 49, P=0.03) to be positive. Orient Gene positive Innova negative result-pairs became more frequent over time (P<0.001). If Innova was swabbed second, it was less likely to agree with a positive Orient Gene result (P=0.005); swabbing first with Innova made no significant difference (P=0.85).Of 311 individuals completing the exit questionnaire, 90.7% reported dual swabbing was easy, 57.1% said it was no barrier to their daily routine and 65.6% preferred dual testing. Respondents had more confidence in dual c.f. single test results (median 9 cf. 8 on 10-point scale, P<0.001).Viral cultures from swabs taken at Days 5-7 were positive for 6/31 (19.4%, 7.5%-37.5%) and indeterminate for 11/31 (35.5%, 19.2%-54.6%) LFT-positive participants, indicating they were likely still infectious.Conclusions Dual brand testing increased LFT detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen by a small but meaningful margin and was acceptable to hospital workers. Viral cultures demonstrated that policies recommending safe return to work ∼5 days after Omicron infection/exposure were flawed. Key-workers should be prepared for dynamic self-testing protocols in future pandemics.Trial registration https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN47058442 (IRAS Project ID:311842)Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 waves caused large-scale healthcare worker absence in late 2021 – early 2022, risking patient safety from both Covid-19 and reduced care capacityLateral flow tests (LFTs) reliably detected SARS-CoV-2 antigen, more so with Omicron than prior variants, identifying the most infectious individualsSelf-testing with LFT SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests reduced Covid-19 transmission, mitigating risks of return to work, including healthcare settingsDual c.f. single brand LFT testing increased SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection marginally, but more than can be explained by extending swabbing from nose-only to nose-throatNHS deployment of nose-only LFTs in response to compound pressures from Omicron, winter and pandemic burnout was safe and acceptable to most participating hospital staffCulturable virus was detected confidently in a fifth (and potentially in a further third) of LFT-positive hospital workers 5-7 days after their self-referral for testing, indicating substantial protracted infectiousnessThis study shows international Covid-19 policies for return to work after fixed periods (e.g. 5 days after positive test) were flawed: too little emphasis was placed on variation in infectivity between individualsFuture pandemic preparedness needs to plan testing quality assurance unified across healthcare and community self-testing contexts, including continuous study of serial daily antigen, nucleic acid and culturable virus test results"

Current techniques lack the ability to accurately predict COVID-19 patients’ clinical type, especially as SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate.Objective In this work, we explore both predictability and interpretability of multiple state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques trained and tested under different biomedical data types and COVID-19 variants.Methods Comprehensive patient-level data were collected from 362 patients (214 severe, 148 non-severe) with the original SARS-CoV-2 variant in 2020 and 1000 patients (500 severe, 500 non-severe) with the Omicron variant in 2022-2023. The data included 26 biochemical features from blood testing and 26 clinical features from each patient’s clinical characteristics and medical history. Different types of ML techniques, including penalized logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and support vector machines (SVM) were applied to build predictive models based on each data modality separately and together for each variant set.Results All ML models performed similarly under different testing scenarios. The fused characteristic modality yielded the highest area under the curve (AUC) score achieving 0.914 on average. The second highest AUC was 0.876 achieved by the biochemical modality alone, followed by 0.825 achieved by clinical modality alone. All ML models were robust when cross-tested with original and Omicron variant patient data. Upon model interpretation, our models ranked elevated d-dimer (biochemical feature), elevated high sensitivity troponin I (biochemical feature), and age greater than 55 years (clinical feature) as the most predictive features of severe COVID-19.Conclusions We found ML to be a powerful tool for predicting severe COVID-19 based on comprehensive individual patient-level data. Further, ML models trained on the biochemical and clinical modalities together witness enhanced predictive power. The improved performance of these ML models when trained and cross-tested with Omicron variant data supports the robustness of ML as a tool for clinical decision support."

By December 2021 it had claimed up to 18.2 million excess deaths. Compared to no (digital) transfer, did digital cash transfer reduce excess deaths? Serendipitously, two years earlier the world reported levels of trust in science. Did such trust inoculate societies from the pandemic?MATERIALS & METHODS The growing excess deaths literature distinguishes causal factors (e.g. digital transfer) from risk factors (e.g. trust). During the pandemic period, no randomised trials of digital transfer with excess deaths as primary outcome were registered. This study used reports from 170 countries and applied endogenous treatment models to overcome the endogeneity of digital transfer.RESULTS & DISCUSSION I found that serendipity matters: countries with high trust in science suffered fewer excess deaths. But creativity matters more. Digital transfers –some creatively scrambled from scratch– reduced excess deaths by many more. Equally marked, North-South inequity in excess deaths persists, consistent with the concentration of vaccine distributions in the North early on. All three are statistically significant.A series of robustness analyses points to the results being reliable to change in outcome estimates, change in trust sources, and change in treatment of omitted countries. Mechanistic analyses show evidence that digital transfer created leg room for governments to expand stringent restrictions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, while in the South it weakened the correlation between informal economy and excess deaths. This study of the causal effect of digital cash transfer on a hard outcome (excess deaths) revealed ample global digital dividends across the largest number of countries. This new evidence also suggests that improving and monitoring trust in science can offer considerable benefits for humanity."

We sought to systematically review approaches to measure four aspects of changes to the menstrual cycle—bleeding, blood, pain, and perceptions— caused by any source and used in any field. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and four instrument databases and included peer-reviewed articles published between 2006 and 2023 that reported on the development or validation of instruments assessing menstrual changes using quantitative or mixed-methods methodology. We evaluated instruments on measure quality and utility for clinical trials. From a total of 8,490 articles, 8,316 were excluded (i.e., 376 duplicates, 7,704 during title/abstract screening, and 236 during full text review), yielding 94 instruments from 174 included articles. Almost half of articles were from the United States or United Kingdom and over half of instruments were only in English, Spanish, French, or Portuguese. Most instruments measured bleeding, pain, or perceptions, but few assessed blood. Nearly 60% of instruments were developed for populations with menstrual or gynecologic disorders or symptoms. Most instruments had fair or good measure quality and/or clinical trial utility; however, most instruments lacked evidence on responsiveness, question sensitivity and/or transferability, and only three instruments had good scores of both quality and utility. Although we took a novel, broad, and transdisciplinary approach, our systematic review found important gaps in the literature and instrument landscape and a need to examine the menstrual cycle in a more comprehensive, inclusive, and standardized way. Our findings can inform the development of new or modified instruments, which—if used across the many fields that study menstrual health—can contribute to a more systemic and holistic understanding of menstruation and the menstrual cycle."

We will compare gut microbiota (measured near the time of admission) among patients with sepsis who do and do not develop sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.Rationale Sepsis afflicts nearly 50 million people annually, and sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication that contributes to morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare costs. Despite the clinical significance of AKI in sepsis, we still do not understand why some patients with sepsis develop AKI while others do not. The gut microbiome has been implicated in other clinical features and sequelae of sepsis, but to date has not been studied in sepsis-induced AKI.Objective To determine whether gut microbiota predict AKI in patients with suspected sepsis.Hypothesis We hypothesize that among patients with suspected sepsis, gut bacterial density and identity (at the time of admission) predict the onset and severity of AKI.Study design We will perform a matched case-control study nested in an observational cohort. The cohort includes patients admitted to the University of Michigan in 2016-2020 with suspected sepsis. We will divide patients into cohorts that did and did not develop AKI. We will derive matched cohorts based on relevant clinical covariates. We will characterize their gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of rectal swabs obtained within 24 hours of AKI onset. We will compare admission gut microbiota across these matched cohorts to test our primary hypothesis."

Apparent vaccine effectiveness was compared in the 29 states.Results Prevalence of long COVID was 7.4% (95% CI 7.3-7.6) and CI was 13.4% (13.2-13.6) with both rates higher among women, ages 18-64 years, Hispanics, American Indians, ever smokers, those with depression, e-cigarette users, and those with more of the co-morbidities of diabetes, asthma, COPD, and obesity. The strong association between long COVID and CI was confirmed. Apparent vaccine effectiveness of 3 or more doses vs <3 was 38% for long COVID and 35% for CI, in both cases reducing rates for 3 or more doses to those comparable to adults with 0 comorbidities and showing dose response gradients. For CI, apparent vaccine effectiveness was similar for respondents with or without long COVID. Logistic regression confirmed most results except the magnitude of vaccine effectiveness on CI was reduced in some models while vaccine effectiveness for long COVID was confirmed.Conclusions More research is needed to understand the apparent effectiveness of COVID vaccines on CI but, if confirmed, results could expand the list of non-infectious outcomes for which mRNA vaccines can be effective."

However, comprehensive investigations of the different motor abilities and the changes thereof across the adult lifespan remain sparse.We, therefore, extensively assessed essential basic and complex motor functions in 444 healthy adults covering a wide age range (range 21 to 88 years). Basic motor functions, here defined as simple isolated single or repetitive movements in one direction, were assessed by means of maximum grip strength (GS) and maximum finger-tapping frequency (FTF). Complex motor functions, comprising composite sequential movements involving both proximal and distal joints/muscle groups, were evaluated with the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT), and the Purdue Pegboard Test.Men achieved higher scores than women concerning GS and FTF, whereas women stacked more pins per time than men during the Purdue Pegboard Test. There was no significant sex effect regarding JTT. We observed a significant but task-specific reduction of basic and complex motor performance scores across the adult lifespan. Linear regression analyses significantly predicted the participants’ ages based on motor performance scores (R2 = .502). Of note, the ratio between the left- and right-hand performance remained stable across ages for all tests. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed three motor components across all tests that represented dexterity, force, and speed. These components were consistently present in young (21 – 40 years), middle-aged (41 – 60 years), and older (61 – 88 years) adults, as well as in women and men. Based on the three motor components, K-means clustering analysis differentiated high- and low-performing participants across the adult life span.The rich motor data set of 444 healthy participants revealed age- and sex-dependent changes in essential basic and complex motor functions. Notably, the comprehensive assessment allowed for generating robust motor components across the adult lifespan. Our data may serve as a reference for future studies of healthy subjects and patients with motor deficits. Moreover, these findings emphasize the importance of comprehensively assessing different motor functions, including dexterity, force, and speed, to characterize human motor abilities and their age-related decline."

The solution is derived by combining network concepts with the integro-differential equations.This solution has two parameters: one describing disease transmissibility and a second characterizing population interactions. The verified solution leads directly to useful, previously unknown, analytical expressions which characterize an epidemic. These include novel expressions for the effective reproduction number, time to peak in new infections, and the final size.Using COVID -19 data from six countries, the transmissibility parameter is estimated and subsequently used to estimate the normalized contagiousness of an individual, a close approximation to viral shedding measured in infected persons. The population interaction parameter is estimated using the Google Residential Mobility Measure. With these parameter estimations, the KMES accurately projects case data from the COVID-19 pandemic in six countries over a 60-day period with R2 values above 0.85.As to performance over longer periods, the KMES projects the Covid-19 total case data from the United States 21 days in advance over an 18-month period with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 4.1%. The KMES also accurately identifies the beginnings and peaks of outbreaks within multi month periods in case data from 4 countries."

This study aimed to identify novel genes associated with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in patients with sporadic cystic kidney disease in which a clear genetic change was not identified in established genes. A next-generation sequencing panel analyzed known genes related to renal cysts in 118 sporadic cases, followed by whole-genome sequencing on 47 unrelated individuals without identified candidate variants. Three male patients were found to have rare missense variants in the X-linked gene Cilia And Flagella Associated Protein 47 (CFAP47). CFAP47 was expressed in primary cilia of human renal tubules, and knockout mice exhibited vacuolation of tubular cells and tubular dilation, providing evidence that CFAP47 is a causative gene involved in cyst formation. This discovery of CFAP47 as a newly identified gene associated with PKD, displaying X-linked inheritance, emphasizes the need for further cases to understand the role of CFAP47 in PKD."

The pathophysiology underlying Long COVID remains unclear but appears to involve multiple mechanisms including persistent inflammation, coagulopathy, autoimmunity, and organ damage. Studies suggest that microclots, also known as fibrinaloids, play a role in Long COVID. In this context, we developed a method to quantify microclots and investigated the relationship between microclot counts and Long COVID. We show that as a cohort, platelet-poor plasma from Long COVID samples had a higher microclot count compared to control groups but retained a wide distribution of counts. Recent COVID-19 infections were also seen to be associated with microclot counts higher than the control groups and equivalent to the Long COVID cohort, with a subsequent time-dependent reduction of counts. Our findings suggest that microclots could be a potential biomarker of disease and/or a treatment target in some Long COVID patients."

Furthermore, TMEM106B has been investigated as a disease modifier in the context of healthy aging and across multiple neurodegenerative diseases. The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the effect of TMEM106B on gray matter volume and cognition in each of the common genetic FTD groups and in sporadic FTD patients.Methods Participants were enrolled through the ARTFL/LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) study, which includes symptomatic and presymptomatic individuals with a pathogenic mutation in C9orf72, GRN, MAPT, VCP, TBK1, TARDBP, symptomatic non-mutation carriers, and non-carrier family controls. All participants were genotyped for the TMEM106B rs1990622 SNP. Cross-sectionally, linear mixed-effects models were fitted to assess an association between TMEM106B and genetic group interaction with each outcome measure (gray matter volume and UDS3-EF for cognition), adjusting for education, age, sex and CDR®+NACC-FTLD sum of boxes. Subsequently, associations between TMEM106B and each outcome measure were investigated within the genetic group. For longitudinal modeling, linear mixed-effects models with time by TMEM106B predictor interactions were fitted.Results The minor allele of TMEM106B rs1990622, linked to a decreased risk of FTD, associated with greater gray matter volume in GRN mutation carriers under the recessive dosage model. This was most pronounced in the thalamus in the left hemisphere, with a retained association when considering presymptomatic GRN mutation carriers only. The minor allele of TMEM106B rs1990622 also associated with greater cognitive scores among all C9orf72 mutation carriers and in presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers, under the recessive dosage model.Discussion We identified associations of TMEM106B with gray matter volume and cognition in the presence of GRN and C9orf72 mutations. This further supports TMEM106B as modifier of TDP-43 pathology. The association of TMEM106B with outcomes of interest in presymptomatic GRN and C9orf72 mutation carriers could additionally reflect TMEM106B’s impact on divergent pathophysiological changes before the appearance of clinical symptoms."

However, their knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding TB, particularly in Ethiopia’s pastoralist areas, remains unexamined. This study evaluates THs’ KAP on TB and their perceptions to collaborate with conventional health systems on TB control.Method A cross-sectional survey was conducted among THs in Kereyu, Ethiopia from September 2014 to January 2015. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, 268 THs were interviewed. Health Extension workers helped identify the THs.Results Of the 268 participants, 80.6% were male. 97.4% were aware of TB (locally “dukubba soombaa”), with 80.2% associating its cause to proximity with a TB patient. Coughing for over two weeks was identified as a primary TB symptom by 87.35%. However, 66.4% displayed limited biomedical knowledge on TB. A notable 38.4% associated TB with sadness and hopelessness, while 47.8% utilized plant-based remedies for treatment. Impressively, 86.2% expressed willingness to collaborate with conventional health services for TB control.Conclusion The THs had limited biomedical knowledge and some misconceptions about TB. Despite providing traditional medicine to treat TB, their readiness to collaborate with established health systems is promising. Thus, Ethiopian TB control initiatives should consider integrating THs via targeted training and health education interventions."

We used a repeated-measures design (4-hour time intervals) to study the association between patient sex (female, male) or race and ethnicity (Asian, Black, Hispanic, White) and sedation outcomes. Sedation outcomes included sedative use (propofol, benzodiazepine, dexmedetomidine) and minimum sedation score. We divided sedative use into five categories: no sedative given, then lowest, second, third, and highest quartiles of sedative dose. We used multilevel Bayesian proportional odds modeling to adjust for baseline and time-varying covariates and reported posterior odds ratios with 95% credible intervals [CrI].Results We studied 6,764 patients: 43% female; 3.5% Asian, 12% Black, 4.5% Hispanic and 80% white. We analyzed 116,519 4-hour intervals. Benzodiazepines were administered to 2,334 (36%) patients. Black patients received benzodiazepines less often and at lower doses than White patients (OR 0.66, CrI 0.49 to 0.92). Propofol was administered to 3,865 (57%) patients. Female patients received propofol less often and at lower doses than male patients (OR 0.72, CrI 0.61 to 0.86). Dexmedetomidine was administered to 1,439 (21%) patients, and use was largely similar across sex or race and ethnicity. As expressed by sedation scores, male patients were more sedated than female patients (OR 1.41, CrI 1.23 to 1.62), and White patients were less sedated than Black patients (OR 0.78, CrI 0.65 to 0.95).Conclusion Among patients invasively ventilated for at least 24 hours, intravenous sedation and attained sedation levels varied by sex and race and ethnicity. Adherence to sedation guidelines may improve equity in sedation management for critically ill patients."

The present investigation was aimed to study the molecular mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance among clinical P. aeruginosa isolated from Dhaka, including alterations in target sites of the antimicrobial action.Laboratory collection of 53 P. aeruginosa were subjected to conventional cultural and biochemical characterization, followed by molecular identification using 16S rDNA sequencing. Susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was tested by disc diffusion method followed by MIC assay. Resistant isolates were analyzed for mutation in their QRDR regions of gyrA and parC, and subjected to PCR detection of plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes qnrA, qnrS and qnrB.Among the isolates, 28% were found to be resistant to both fluoroquinolones tested. All of the fluoroquinolone resistant isolates carried a single mutation in gyrA (Thr-83-Ile), while 20% carried a single parC mutation (Ser-87-Leu). Higher level of MIC was observed in isolates carrying alterations at both sites. None of the isolates harbored any PMQR genes investigated, suggesting that chromosomal mutations in QRDR regions to be the major contributing factor for quinolone resistance in P. aeruginosa under investigation."

In prostate cancer, studies of FAP expression using tissue microarrays are conflicting, such that its clinical potential is unclear. Furthermore, little is known regarding FAP expression in benign prostatic tissues. Here we demonstrated, using a novel iterative multiplex IHC assay in standard tissue sections, that FAP was nearly absent in normal regions, but was increased consistently in regions of proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA). In carcinoma, FAP was expressed in all cases, but was highly heterogeneous. High FAP levels were associated with increased pathological stage and cribriform morphology. We verified that FAP levels in cancer correlated with CD163+ M2 macrophage density. In this first report to quantify FAP protein in benign prostate and primary tumors, using standard large tissue sections, we clarify that FAP is present in all primary prostatic carcinomas, supporting its potential clinical relevance. The finding of high levels of FAP within PIA supports the injury/regeneration model for its pathogenesis and suggests that it harbors a protumorigenic stroma. Yet, high levels of FAP in benign regions could lead to false positive FAP-based molecular imaging results in clinically localized prostate cancer."

Current school-based preventive chemotherapy (PC) programs that use benzimidazole derivatives (e.g., albendazole) against soil-transmitted helminths do not effectively treat strongyloidiasis, which requires treatment with ivermectin. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of mass drug administration with ivermectin for the control of strongyloidiasis.Methods We developed a mathematical model to simulate the population dynamics of S. stercoralis and the impact of school-based and community-wide PC across a range of epidemiological settings. We simulated 10-year PC programs with varying treatment coverages. We estimated a primary outcome of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted by each PC strategy and calculate the programmatic cost (US$) of each strategy. We estimated cost-effectiveness by comparing strategies by their incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (US$/averted DALY) and expected loss curves.Findings The model found community-based PC was the most cost-effective strategy (≤600 US$ / DALY averted), despite costing approximately 5 times as much as school-based PC. Community-based PC targeted at ages 5 and above reduced infection levels close to 0% within 5 to 6 years. School-based PC was predicted to have very little impact. These results were robust across a range of epidemiologic settings above a measured prevalence of 2-5% in school age children.Interpretation Annual community-based PC is the most cost-effective public health strategy to control strongyloidiasis, being superior to school-based PC due to most of the infections and mortality occurring in adults. A baseline prevalence of 2% of infection in school age children, as measured by Baermann or stool culture, is a suitable minimum threshold for cost-effective implementation of community-based PC.Funding World Health Organization."

Biological age can be estimated by DNA methylation age (DNAmA) and its deviation from chronological age, DNAmA acceleration (DNAmAA). Low levels of serum selenium, selenoprotein P (SELENOP), and the selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) are associated with adverse health outcomes and selenium supplementation is discussed as an anti-aging intervention.Methods In this study we analyzed 1,568 older participants from the Berlin Aging Study II (mean age +/− SD: 68.8 +/− 3.7 years, 51% women). DNAmA was estimated from genome-wide DNA methylation data using the Horvath, GrimAge, and DunedinPACE algorithms. Serum selenium levels were measured by total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectroscopy. SELENOP was measured by ELISA and GPx3 was derived from a larger set of mass spectrometry proteomics data.Results Participants with deficient serum selenium levels (<90μg/L) had a higher rate of biological aging (DunedinPACE, p=0.01, n=865). This association remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, and genetic ancestry (β=-0.02, SE=0.01, 95%CI: - 0.034 to −0.004, n=757). Compared to the highest quartile, participants in the lowest quartile of SELENOP levels showed an accelerated biological aging rate (DunedinPACE, β=-0.03, SE=0.01, 95%CI: −0.051 to −0.008, n=740, fully adjusted model). Similarly, after adjustment for covariates, accelerated biological age was found in participants within the lowest GPx3 quartile compared to participants in the fourth quartile (DunedinPACE, p=<0.001 and GrimAge, p<0.001).Conclusion Our study suggests that low levels of selenium biomarkers are associated with accelerated biological aging measured as DNAmA. This effect was not substantially changed after adjustment for known covariates."

Microplastics (MPs), ranging from 5 mm to 1 µm, are pervasive in the environment. They are found in air, sea, freshwater, soils, food chains and studies show that tiny MPs, smaller than 10 μm, can cross cellular membranes, posing potential health risks through oxidative stress, inflammation, immune dysfunction, neurotoxicity and reprotoxicity.In recent years, research has shown that microplastics have negative effects on the female reproductive systems of animals. However, there is still a lack of evidence on how the accumulation of microplastics affects the reproductive health of human females. This study aimed to examine the presence of microplastics in the ovarian follicular fluid of 18 women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment whose samples were processed using a patented method endorsed nationally and internationally. Plastic particles <10 µm were measured using SEM with EDX detection. Preventive measures were taken to avoid contamination during the process. Microplastics (dimensions <10 µm) were detected in 14 out of 18 samples of follicular fluid, with an average of 2191 p/ml (0 - 7181p/ml) and with a mean diameter of MPs of 4.48 µm (3.18-5.54 µm). A significant correlation was found between microplastic concentration and FSH (p-value <0.05), as well as a weak correlation with BMI, age and Estradiol. There was no correlation with fertilization outcomes, miscarriages, or live birth. This is the first study to provide evidence for microplastics’ presence in ovarian follicular fluid in women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment, representing a potential threat to female reproductive function.Download figureOpen in new tab"

Multiple regression models were used to identify factors most predictive of poor sleep, and changes in sleep quality over time.Results There were strong associations between poor sleep and contemporaneous severity of personality disorder and the presence of other mental disorders at 12 and 30 years follow-up, but not with disorder presence at other time points. Improvements in personality disorder were associated with improvements in sleep between time points, and attenuated the positive unadjusted effects of recovery from anxiety or depressive disorders to insignificance. Relapse into further episodes of mental disorder predicted poorer sleep, whereas worsening personality disorder was not predictive of significant changes when adjusting for other factors.Conclusions This study demonstrates the complex interplay between anxiety, depressive and personality disorders and sleep disturbance over a long follow-up period. Future research might look to examine the relationship between personality disorder and disturbed sleep with interventional studies and by integrating personality trait research."

As single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of human tissues becomes increasingly common for disease profiling, the insights obtained from this data could influence target selection strategies. Whilst the use of scRNA-seq to understand target biology is well established, the impact of single-cell data in increasing the probability of candidate therapeutic targets to successfully advance from research to clinic has not been fully characterized. Inspired by previous work on an association between genetic evidence and clinical success, we used retrospective analysis of known drug target genes to identify potential predictors of target clinical success from scRNA-seq data. Particularly, we investigated whether successful drug targets are associated with cell type specific expression in a disease-relevant tissue (cell type specificity) or cell type specific over-expression in disease patients compared to healthy controls (disease cell specificity). Analysing scRNA-seq data across 30 diseases and 13 tissues, we found that both classes of scRNA-seq support significantly increase the odds of clinical success for gene-disease pairs. We estimate that combined they could approximately triple the chances of a target reaching phase III. Importantly, scRNA-seq analysis identifies a larger and complementary target space to that of direct genetic evidence. In particular, scRNA-seq support is more likely to prioritize therapeutically tractable classes of genes such as membrane-bound proteins. Our study suggests that scRNA-seq-derived information on cell type- and disease-specific expression can be leveraged to identify tractable and disease-relevant targets, with increased probability of success in the clinic."

Determining sources of heterogeneity in depression is important to gain insights into its diverse and complex neural etiology.Objective This study aims to determine how clinical and neurobiological sources of variation in depression interact to give rise to population heterogeneity. Specifically, we aimed to test if depression heterogeneity is characterized by subgroups that differ both clinically and neurobiologically and/or whether multiple neurobiological profiles give rise to the same clinical presentation.Design Clinically dissociated groups were selected to isolate clinical characteristics of depression (symptoms of anhedonia, depressed mood, and somatic disturbance; severity indices of lifetime chronicity and acute impairment; and late onset). Residual neurobiological heterogeneity within each group was assessed using neurobiologically driven clustering.Setting This study utilizes population-based data from the UK Biobank over multiple imaging sites.Participants All depressed participants (N=6,121) met one of the three clinical criteria: ICD10 label for depressive episode(s), probable MDD status, one or more recorded depression episodes. Control participants (N=8,565) reported minimal depression scores and no history of depression.Exposure There are no interventions or exposures in this study.Main Outcomes and Measures This study used several clinical features, multimodal MRI, and outcome phenotypes.Results The six clinically dissociated subgroups (total N=1909, n male=771, mean[SD] age=62.64[7.78]; subgroups: 211<n<576) had significantly larger (p<0.005, CI<[-0.260,-0.042]) neurobiological normative deviations than a comparison heterogeneous group (n=4210) and had distinct neurobiological profiles from each other. Imaging driven clustering within each clinically dissociated group identified two stable subtypes within the acute impairment group that differed significantly (p=0.003, CI:[-1.23,-0.345]) in cognitive ability, despite identical clinical profiles.Conclusions and Relevance The study identified distinct neurobiological profiles related to particular clinical depression features that may explain inconsistencies in the literature and sub-clusters within the acute impairment group with cognitive differences that were only differentiable by neurobiology. Our results provide evidence that multiple neurobiological profiles may give rise to the same clinical presentation, emphasizing the presence of complex interactions between clinical and neurobiological sources of heterogeneity.Study type Cross-sectional studyQuestion How do clinical and neurobiological sources of variation in depression interact to give rise to population heterogeneity?Findings In this cohort study, we identified statistically significant neurobiological profiles distinct to dissociable clinical features of depression and provide evidence for residual neurobiological heterogeneity after tightly controlling clinical variation, resulting in clusters with statistically significant differences in cognition.Meaning These results provide insights into the complex etiological relationships between neurobiological and clinical variation in depression and inform future biotype research by highlighting the need to distinguish biotypes both clinically and neurobiologically."

Often, a two-stage screening with two different testing approaches is used. We aimed to investigate the optimal screening algorithm, based on data from the literature published in the last 30 years. A particular focus of the study was to synthesize the existing evidence on two-stage newborn hearing screening regarding the refer rate (RFR), the percentage of children that did not pass the second test or were lost after the first test.Methods We searched MEDLINE and Scopus for studies on two-stage NHS using transitory evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) or automated auditory brainstem response (AABR). All studies on newborns who received their first test as an inpatient and a second test up to one month later were eligible. Random effects meta-analysis and Bayesian modeling were performed to estimate RFR, effects of the second test phase on the RFR, and sensitivity and specificity of TEOAE and AABR, respectively. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS-II. The unfunded study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023403091).Results Eighty-five study protocols, including over 1,12 million newborns, met the inclusion criteria. Certainty in the evidence was rated as moderate. The RFR was higher when the test method was changed than without a change of method (AABR-AABR: RFR = 1.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9, 1.8%), TEOAE-TEOAE: RFR = 2.7% (CI: 2.2, 3.2%), TEOAE-AABR: RFR = 3.9% (CI: 2.9, 5.1%), AABR-TEOAE: 5.9% (CI: 5.0, 6.9%). Across all protocols, both methods demonstrated very high sensitivity (AABR: 99.9% (95% credibility interval (CrI): 99.6, 100.0%), TEOAE: 100.0% (CrI: 99.9, 100.0%)) and high specificity (AABR: 96.9% (CrI: 96.8, 97.0%), TEOAE: 91.1% (CrI: 91.0, 91.2%)).Conclusions Strategies that did not involve changes to the screening method had lower RFR. Although both methods demonstrated high sensitivity, AABR appears to have slightly higher specificity compared to TEOAE."

These programs have individualized processes for determining which genes and genetic disorders are queried and reported in newborns. We compared lists of genes from 26 research and commercial newborn screening programs and found substantial heterogeneity among the genes included. A total of 1,750 genes were included in at least one newborn genome sequencing program, but only 74 genes were included on >80% of gene lists, 16 of which are not associated with conditions on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel. We used a linear regression model to explore factors related to the inclusion of individual genes across programs, finding that a high evidence base as well as treatment efficacy were two of the most important factors for inclusion. We applied a machine learning model to predict how suitable a gene is for newborn sequencing. As knowledge about and treatments for genetic disorders expand, this model provides a dynamic tool to reassess genes for newborn screening implementation. This study highlights the complex landscape of gene list curation among genomic newborn screening programs and proposes an empirical path forward for determining the genes and disorders of highest priority for newborn screening programs."

Globally, hepatocellular carcinoma ranks as the third most lethal cancer, with the number of deaths expected to further increase by 2040. In adults, disparities in incidence and survival are well described while pediatric epidemiology is not well characterized.Objective To describe incidence and survival for pediatric (ages 0-19 years) hepatocellular carcinoma cases and compare these measures to adults (ages ≥20 years) diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma. We evaluated demographic factors and clinical characteristics that influence incidence and outcomes.Design Population-based cohort study.Setting Incidence data from the US Cancer Statistics database from 2003 to 2020 and 5-year relative survival from the National Program of Cancer Registries from 2001 to 2019, covering 97% and 83% of the US population, respectively.Participants 355,349 US Cancer Statistics and 257,406 the National Program of Cancer Registries patients were identified using ICD-O-3 C22.0 and 8170-5 codes.Main Outcomes and Measures Incidence annual percent change (APC) and average APC (AAPC) using joinpoint regression. Five-year relative survival. All-cause survival estimated using multivariate Cox modeling. Corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.Results Incidence rate per 100,000 persons was 0.056 (95%CI:0.052-0.060) for pediatric cases and 7.793 (7.767-7.819) for adults. Incidence was stable in the pediatric population (0.3 AAPC, −1.1-1.7). In contrast, after periods of increase, incidence declined in adults after 2015 (−1.5 APC). Relative survival increased over time for both pediatric and adult ages and was higher for children and adolescents (46.4%, 95%CI:42.4-50.3) than adults (20.7%, 95%CI:20.5-20.9) overall and when stratified by stage. Regression modeling showed that non-Hispanic Black race and ethnicity was associated with higher risk of death in children and adolescents (1.48, 95%CI:1.07-2.05) and adults (1.11, 95%CI:1.09-1.12) compared to non-Hispanic white race and ethnicity.Conclusions and Relevance Between 2003 and 2020 in the United States, pediatric incidence was stable while incidence in adults began to decline after 2015. Survival was higher across all stages for children and adolescents compared to adults. Non-Hispanic Black race and ethnicity showed a higher risk of death for both age groups. Further studies could explore the factors that influence these outcome disparities.Question How does incidence and survival compare between pediatric and adult hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)?Findings In contrast to adults, pediatric incidence rates of HCC were stable, and no demographic risk factors for incidence were identified. Pediatric HCC survival was higher than adults. Non-Hispanic Black race and ethnicity, small metropolitan county, and non-fibrolamellar histology, were risk factors in both pediatric and adult groups.Meaning Non-Hispanic Black patients and those living in smaller metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas irrespective of age might benefit from further research in outcome disparities, provider education, and prospective studies to maximize outcomes through effective risk-adapted management strategies."

Although experimental and quantitative analyses have improved our understanding of the immunological processes defining an individual’s antibody repertoire, how these within-host processes are linked to population-level influenza epidemiology remains unclear. Here, we used a multi-level mathematical model to jointly infer antibody dynamics and individual-level lifetime influenza A/H3N2 infection histories for 1,130 individuals in Guangzhou, China, using 67,683 haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay measurements against 20 A/H3N2 strains from repeat serum samples collected between 2009 and 2015. These estimated infection histories allowed us to reconstruct historical seasonal influenza patterns and to investigate how influenza incidence varies over time, space and age in this population. We estimated median annual influenza infection rates to be approximately 18% from 1968 to 2015, but with substantial variation between years. 88% of individuals were estimated to have been infected at least once during the study period (2009-2015), and 20% were estimated to have three or more infections in that time. We inferred decreasing infection rates with increasing age, and found that annual attack rates were highly correlated across all locations, regardless of their distance, suggesting that age has a stronger impact than fine-scale spatial effects in determining an individual’s antibody profile. Finally, we reconstructed each individual’s expected antibody profile over their lifetime and inferred an age-stratified relationship between probability of infection and HI titre. Our analyses show how multi-strain serological panels provide rich information on long term, epidemiological trends, within-host processes and immunity when analyzed using appropriate inference methods, and adds to our understanding of the life course epidemiology of influenza A/H3N2."

In this study, we explored the utility of a smartphone app to robustly identify symptomatic respiratory illnesses, while reducing burden and facilitating real-time data collection and adherence monitoring.Methods The AERIAL TempTracker smartphone app was assessed in the AERIAL and COCOON birth cohort studies. Participants recorded daily temperatures and associated symptoms/medications in TempTracker for 6-months, with daily use adherence measured over this period. Regular participant feedback was collected at quarterly study visits. Symptomatic respiratory illnesses meeting study criteria prompted an automated app alert and collection of a nose/throat swab for testing of eight respiratory viruses.Results In total, 32,764 daily TempTracker entries from 348 AERIAL participants and 30,542 entries from 361 COCOON participants were recorded. This corresponded to an adherence median of 67.0% (range 1.9-100%) and 55.4% (range 1.1-100%) of each participant’s study period, respectively. Feedback was positive, with 75.5% of responding families reporting no barriers to use. A total of 648 symptomatic respiratory illness events from 249/709 participants were identified with significant variability between individuals in the frequency (0-16 events per participant), duration (1-13 days), and virus detected (rhinovirus in 42.7%).Conclusions A smartphone app provides a reliable method to capture the longitudinal virus data in cohort studies which facilitates the understanding of early life infections in chronic respiratory disease development.Summary at a Glance A smartphone app can facilitate capturing symptomatic respiratory viral infections in longitudinal cohort studies, while supporting adherence and reducing participant burden. The app helped identify community variations in virus prevalence as well as the individual variability in viral responses necessary to understand the mechanism of chronic disease development."

It is important to evaluate how adult vapers, including those who also smoke respond to e-cigarette taxation. The purpose of this study is to examine factors associated with adult vapers’ cost perception of e-cigarettes relative to cigarettes and budget allocations between two products.Methods We recruited a nationally representative sample of 801 adult e-cigarette users in the U.S., who participated in an online survey in April and May 2023. Nested-ordered logit models and ordinary least squares regressions were used in the analysis.Results On average, monthly e-cigarette spending was $82.22, and cigarette spending was $118.77 among dual users. Less frequent e-cigarette use and higher state-level e-cigarette taxes were associated with perceiving smoking as cheaper than vaping. Age and exclusive use of tank systems were associated with perceiving vaping as cheaper than smoking. Exclusive use of tank systems was also associated with lower e-cigarette spending. Adults who used e-cigarettes more frequently preferred to report weekly budget on e-cigarettes (p < 0.01), and among dual users, everyday smokers preferred to report weekly (versus monthly) budget on cigarettes compared to someday smokers (p < 0.001).Conclusion Among US adult vapers, frequencies of tobacco use and e-cigarette device type are closely related to cost measures; and e-cigarette taxes are associated with cost perception of e-cigarettes relative to cigarettes, suggesting potential financial disincentive for vaping. Policymaker may consider imposing differential taxes by e-cigarette product types due to their different costs to consumers."

This study aimed to clarify the status of sports specialization and examine the relationships between specialization and training status in Japanese young soccer players.Four hundred Japanese young male soccer players were included. The players’ parents completed a web questionnaire that consisted of three-point questions regarding specialization and training status (year, days of playing soccer, age when starting soccer). The level of specialization and accompanying information were calculated, and data were compared by specialization status. Of the participants, 53.8% demonstrated a high level of specialization. In addition, 74.5% considered soccer more important than other sports, 89.0% trained in soccer for more than 8 months of the year, and 74.0% had quit other sports to focus on soccer or played only soccer. The proportion of participants who played only soccer was significantly higher in the high-specialization group (37.6%) than in the moderate-specialization (22.5%; P < .01) and low-specialization (7.1%; P < .01) groups. By specialization status at grades 4 to 6 (9–12 years), 40.3% of participants demonstrated a high level of specialization. Young Japanese soccer players tend toward early specialization. Factors contributing to the high-specialization level are being active throughout the year and rarely playing other sports. Training volume should be controlled in children of this age with avoidance of early specialization."

A systematic review and meta-analysis,"AbstractObjective Exposure to pesticides is a risk factor for various diseases, yet its association with biological aging remains unclear. We aimed to systematically investigate the relationship between pesticide exposure and biological aging.Methods PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched from inception to August 2023. Observational studies investigating the association between pesticide exposure and biomarkers of biological aging were included. Three-level random-effect meta-analysis was used to synthesize the data. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Results Twenty studies evaluating the associations between pesticide exposure and biomarkers of biological aging in 10,368 individuals were included. Sixteen reported telomere length and four reported epigenetic clocks. Meta-analysis showed no statistically significant associations between pesticide exposure and the Hannum clock (pooled β = 0.27; 95%CI: -0.25, 0.79), or telomere length (pooled Hedges’g = -0.46; 95%CI: -1.10, 0.19). However, the opposite direction of effect for the two outcomes showed an indication of possible accelerated biological aging. After removal of influential effect sizes or low-quality studies, shorter telomere length was found in higher-exposed populations.Conclusion The existing evidence for associations between pesticide exposure and biological aging is limited due to the scarcity of studies on epigenetic clocks and the substantial heterogeneity across studies examining telomere length. High-quality studies incorporating more biomarkers of biological aging, focusing more on active chemical ingredients of pesticides and accounting for potential confounders are needed to enhance our understanding of the impact of pesticides on biological aging."

Understanding the interplay between genital warts, HIV status, and socio-cultural factors is crucial for informing targeted prevention to alleviate the burden of genital warts in vulnerable populations.Aims The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and risk factors of genital warts among women based on their HIV serostatus.Materials and Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among women seeking gynecological consultation at a public Hospital in Cameroon. Data were collected through a survey and medical records, then analyzed using SPSS version 18.0.Results Among 257 women attending the hospital, 60 had genital warts, with the majority being HIV-positive (63.33%). Notably, 67% of these women sought gynecology consultation for the first time for genital warts. The location and types of genital warts were associated with HIV status, with papule genital warts being more prevalent among HIV-infected women and acuminate warts among non-infected women. Additionally, associations were found between smoking, multiple sexual partners, and genital warts among HIV-positive women. The reliance on traditional medicine or homemade remedies (85%) and the high prevalence of self-medication (75%) were also observed.Conclusions Addressing socio-cultural barriers is essential to enhance healthcare-seeking behaviour, facilitate early detection and treatment, and alleviate the burden of genital warts and HIV. Efforts should prioritize awareness-raising, enhancing healthcare access, and integrating traditional medicine into comprehensive healthcare systems."

However, intensive care unit (ICU) survivors often experience long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological problems, and their family members also experience physical and psychological dysfunction, summarized as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), affecting their health-related quality of life. Post-ICU follow-up can improve post-ICU syndrome in patients and their families, but the optimal mode of post-ICU follow-up remains uncertain. The purpose of this study was to build a follow-up model of ICU patients based on symptom management theory.Methods and analysis This study is a quasi-randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in multiple ICUs at one hospital in China, with patients enrolled from January 2024 to December 2024 and followed for 6 months. We expect to enroll 180 ICU patients. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of post-ICU syndrome (PICS) after ICU transfer, and the secondary outcome measure was the incidence of PCS-F, health economics evaluation, and patient/family satisfaction.Ethics and dissemination The protocol was approved by the research ethics committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University (2023 ethical review No. 061). The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international scientific conferences to publicize the research to healthcare professionals, health service authorities and the public.Strengths and limitations of this studyThe strength of this study is that this project adopts systematic and scientific research methods, and the ICU post-follow-up model built on the basis of symptom management theory aims to provide patients with the required, predictable and whole-course ICU post-follow-up service, which is helpful to meet the needs of patients under the realistic situation of limited medical resources, and is conducive to improving the utilization efficiency of medical resources. It is of great significance to optimize medical service system.In the process of clinical implementation of randomized controlled trials, there are many resistance and force majeure factors, and ICU patients are especially special, and they are still in a weak state after being transferred out of ICU, and the implementation of randomized controlled trials is very difficult. Based on this, this study adopts experimental research.This study was only conducted in one hospital in Guizhou, China, which may have some limitations and should be expanded in the future.The nature of the intervention does not allow blinding of study personnel and eligible patients at ICUs."

Recent studies have indicated that activity of the brain’s Default Mode Network (DMN) could prove insightful in monitoring patient recovery from depression and has been used as a therapeutic target itself. An opportunity exists to replicate recent therapeutic protocols targeting DMN connectivity via functional magnetic resonance imaging using the more economically scalable modality of electroencephalogram (EEG). The aim of this work was to validate the accuracy of real-time DMN detection methods applied to EEG data, using a publicly available dataset. Using a Hidden Markov Model to identify a 12-state resting-state network, this work achieved an overall DMN detection accuracy of 95%. Furthermore, the model was able to achieve a correlation of 0.617 between the baseline and calculated DMN fractional occupancy. These results demonstrate the ability of real-time analysis to effectively identify the DMN through EEG data providing an avenue for further applications that monitor and treat mental health disorders."

This study describes the first HEARTS implementation project in the Ministry of Health primary care system in Guatemala. This pilot project was implemented from April to December 2022 in 6 primary health facilities in 3 rural, Indigenous municipalities. The project consisted of HEARTS-aligned strategies that were adapted to foster program sustainability in Guatemala. Outcomes were defined using the RE-AIM framework. The primary reach outcome was treatment rate, defined as the absolute number of patients each month receiving medication treatment for hypertension. The primary effectiveness outcomes were mean systolic blood pressure (BP), mean diastolic BP, and proportion with BP control. In the first month of the post-implementation period, there was a significant increase of 25 patients treated (P=0.002), followed by a significant increase thereafter of 2.4 additional patients treated each month (P=0.007). The mean change in systolic BP was -4.4 (95 CI -8.2 to -0.5, P=0.028) mmHg and mean change in diastolic BP was -0.9 (95 CI -2.8 to 1.1, P=0.376) mmHg. The proportion of the cohort with BP control increased from 33.4% at baseline to 47.1% at 6 months (adjusted change of 13.7% [95 CI 2.2% to 25.2%, P=0.027]). These findings support the feasibility of implementing the HEARTS model for blood pressure control in the Guatemalan MOH primary care system where the vast majority of hypertension patients seek care."

Despite its widespread clinical use, current reference equations for VO2peak show distorted calibration in obese individuals. Using data from the Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise National Database (FRIEND), we sought to develop novel reference equations for VO2peak better calibrated for overweight/obese individuals - in both males and females, by considering body composition metrics.METHODS AND RESULTS Graded treadmill tests from 6,836 apparently healthy individuals were considered in data analysis. We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey equations to estimate lean body mass (eLBM) and body fat percentage (eBF).Multivariable regression was used to determine sex-specific equations for predicting VO2peak considering age terms, eLBM and eBF. The resultant equations were expressed as VO2peak (male) = 2633.4 + 48.7✕eLBM (kg) - 63.6✕eBF (%) - 0.23✕Age2 (R2=0.44) and VO2peak (female) = 1174.9 + 49.4✕eLBM (kg) - 21.7✕eBF (%) - 0.158✕Age2 (R2=0.53). These equations were well-calibrated in subgroups based on sex, age and body mass index (BMI), in contrast to the Wasserman equation. In addition, residuals for the percent-predicted VO2peak (ppVO2) were stable over the predicted VO2peak range, with low CRF defined as < 70% ppVO2 and average CRF defined between 85-115%.CONCLUSIONS The derived VO2peak reference equations provided physiologically explainable and were well-calibrated across the spectrum of age, sex and BMI. These equations will yield more accurate VO2peak evaluation, particularly in obese individuals."

This study aims to apply, evaluate, and compare advanced natural language processing techniques for identifying signs of cognitive decline in clinical notes.Methods This study, conducted at Mass General Brigham (MGB), Boston, MA, included clinical notes from the 4 years prior to initial mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis in 2019 for patients ≥ 50 years. Note sections regarding cognitive decline were labeled manually. A random sample of 4,949 note sections filtered with cognitive functions-related keywords were used for traditional AI model development, and 200 random subset were used for LLM and prompt development; another random sample of 1996 note sections without keyword filtering were used for testing. Prompt templates for large language models (LLM), Llama 2 on Amazon Web Service and GPT-4 on Microsoft Azure, were developed with multiple prompting approaches to select the optimal LLM-based method. Baseline comparisons were made with XGBoost and a hierarchical attention-based deep neural network model. An ensemble of the three models was then constructed using majority vote.Results GPT-4 demonstrated superior accuracy and efficiency to Llama 2. The ensemble model outperformed individual models, achieving a precision of 90.3%, recall of 94.2%, and F1-score of 92.2%. Notably, the ensemble model demonstrated a marked improvement in precision (from a 70%-79% range to above 90%) compared to the best performing single model. Error analysis revealed 63 samples were wrongly predicted by at least one model; however, only 2 cases (3.2%) were mutual errors across all models, indicating diverse error profiles among them.Conclusion Our findings indicate that LLMs and traditional models exhibit diverse error profiles. The ensemble of LLMs and locally trained machine learning models on EHR data was found to be complementary, enhancing performance and improving diagnostic accuracy."

The identification of eosinophils in the colonic mucosa has been associated with disease course. Cell counting is not only time-consuming but can also be subjective to human biases. In this study we developed an automatic eosinophilic cell counting tool from mucosal histopathology images, using deep learning.Method Four pediatric IBD pathologists from two North American pediatric hospitals annotated 530 crops from 143 standard-of-care hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) rectal mucosal biopsies. A 305/75 split was used for training/validation to develop and optimize a U-Net based deep learning model, and 150 crops were used as a test set. The U-Net model was then compared to SAU-Net, a state-of-the-art U-Net variant. We undertook post-processing steps, namely, (1) the pixel-level probability threshold, (2) the minimum number of clustered pixels to designate a cell, and (3) the connectivity. Experiments were run to optimize model parameters using AUROC and cross-entropy loss as the performance metrics.Results The F1-score was 0.86 (95%CI:0.79-0.91) (Precision: 0.77 (95%CI:0.70-0.83), Recall: 0.96 (95%CI:0.93-0.99)) to identify eosinophils as compared to an F1-score of 0.2 (95%CI:0.13-0.26) for SAU-Net (Precision: 0.38 (95%CI:0.31-0.46), Recall: 0.13 (95%CI:0.08-0.19)). The inter-rater reliability was 0.96 (95%CI:0.93-0.97). The correlation between two pathologists and the algorithm was 0.89 (95%CI:0.82-0.94) and 0.88 (95%CI:0.80-0.94) respectively.Conclusion Our results indicate that deep learning-based automated eosinophilic cell counting can obtain a robust level of accuracy with a high degree of concordance with manual expert annotations."

Certain co-morbid conditions cause immune dysfunction and may reduce immune response to vaccination. In contrast, those with co-morbidities may practice infection prevention strategies. Thus, the real-world clinical impact of co-morbidities on SARS-CoV-2 infection in the recent post-vaccination period is not well established. We performed this study to understand the epidemiology of Omicron breakthrough infection and evaluate associations with number of comorbidities in a vaccinated and boosted population.Methods and Findings We performed a retrospective clinical cohort study utilizing the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse. Our study population was identified as fully vaccinated adults with at least one booster. The primary risk factor of interest was the number of co-morbidities. Our primary outcome was incidence and time to first positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test in the Omicron predominant era. We performed multivariable analyses stratified by calendar time using Cox modeling to determine hazard of SARS-CoV-2. In total, 133,191 patients were analyzed. Having 3+ comorbidities was associated with increased hazard for breakthrough (HR=1.2 CI 1.2-1.6). During the second half of the study, having 2 comorbidities (HR= 1.1 95% CI 1.02-1.2) and having 3+ comorbidities (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-1.9) were associated with increased hazard for Omicron breakthrough. Older age was associated with decreased hazard in the first 6 months of follow-up. Interaction terms for calendar time indicated significant changes in hazard for many factors between the first and second halves of the follow-up period.Conclusions Omicron breakthrough is common with significantly higher risk for our most vulnerable patients with multiple co-morbidities. Age related behavioral factors play an important role in breakthrough infection with the highest incidence among young adults. Our findings reflect real-world differences in immunity and exposure risk behaviors for populations vulnerable to COVID-19."

However, the use of these technologies has been questioned in light of limited research conducted and the sensitivities, ethical concerns and potential harms of surveillance. This systematic review aims to: 1) map how surveillance technologies have been employed in inpatient mental health settings, 2) identify any best practice guidance, 3) explore how they are experienced by patients, staff and carers, and 4) examine evidence regarding their impact.Methods We searched five academic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, PubMed and Scopus), one grey literature database (HMIC) and two pre-print servers (medRxiv and PsyArXiv) to identify relevant papers published up to 18/09/2023. We also conducted backwards and forwards citation tracking and contacted experts to identify relevant literature. Quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data were synthesised using a narrative approach.Results A total of 27 studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Included studies reported on CCTV/video monitoring (n = 13), Vision-Based Patient Monitoring and Management (VBPMM) (n = 6), Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) (n = 4), GPS electronic monitoring (n = 2) and wearable sensors (n = 2). Twelve papers (44.4%) were rated as low quality, five (18.5%) medium quality, and ten (37.0%) high quality. Five studies (18.5%) declared a conflict of interest. We identified minimal best practice guidance. Qualitative findings indicate that patient, staff and carer perceptions and experiences of surveillance technologies are mixed and complex. Quantitative findings regarding the impact of surveillance on outcomes such as self-harm, violence, aggression, care quality and cost-effectiveness were inconsistent or weak.Discussion There is currently insufficient evidence to suggest that surveillance technologies in inpatient mental health settings are achieving the outcomes they are employed to achieve, such as improving safety and reducing costs. The studies were generally of low methodological quality, lacked lived experience involvement, and a substantial proportion (18.5%) declared conflicts of interest. Further independent coproduced research is needed to more comprehensively evaluate the impact of surveillance technologies in inpatient settings, including harms and benefits. If surveillance technologies are to be implemented, it will be important to engage all key stakeholders in the development of policies, procedures and best practice guidance to regulate their use, with a particular emphasis on prioritising the perspectives of patients."

In this study, we examined whether treatment with Paxlovid in the acute phase of COVID-19 helps prevent the onset of PASC. We used electronic health records from the National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 426,352 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation (TTE) framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured the onset of novel cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment did not have a significant effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-1.01). However, it had a protective effect on cognitive (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96) and fatigue (RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.98) symptom clusters, which suggests that the etiology of these symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms."

The benefits of pre-stroke physical activity on these limitations remain unclear. To clarify this relationship, we examined the effect of physical activity on the long-term evolution of functional limitations in a cohort of stroke survivors and compared it to a cohort of matched stroke-free adults.Methods Longitudinal data from 2,143 stroke survivors and 10,717 stroke-free adults aged 50 years and older were drawn from a prospective cohort study based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (2004-2022; 8 data collection waves). Physical activity was assessed in the pre-stroke wave. Functional limitations were assessed in the post-stroke waves. Each stroke survivor was matched with 5 stroke-free adults who had similar propensity scores computed on the basis of key covariates, including baseline age, sex, body mass index, limitations in ADL and IADL, chronic conditions and country of residence, before any of the participants from either cohort had experienced a stroke.Results Results showed an interaction between stroke status and physical activity on ADL limitations (b = -0.076; 95% CI = -0.142 to -0.011), with the effect of physical activity being stronger in stroke survivors (b = -0.345, 95% CI = -0.438 to -0.252) than in stroke-free adults (b = -0.269, 95% CI = -0.269 to -0.241).Conclusion The beneficial effect of pre-stroke physical activity on ADL limitations after stroke is stronger than its effect in matched stroke-free adults followed for a similar number of years.Impact Physical activity, an intervention within the physical therapist’s scope of practice, is effective in reducing the risk of functional dependence after stroke. Moreover, pre-stroke levels of physical activity can inform the prognosis of functional dependence in stroke survivors."

A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and important meetings) until 3 September 2023 was conducted. A disproportionality analysis was performed from the first quarter (Q1) of 2013 to Q1 of 2023 using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database. Study heterogeneitywas assessed using the I2 statistic. Using Peto OR and inverse variance methods to calculate the risk and incidence of CVAEs associated with CDK4/6 inhibitors.Findings 21 RCTs and cohort trials (n=24,331) were included. During the follow-up period of 8.4 to 34.0 months, CDK4/6 inhibitors significantly increased the risk of CVAEs (Peto OR, 1.64, 95% confidence interval, 1.23 - 2.21, P < 0.01). The rates of QT prolongation and deep vein thrombosis were 98.83 (89.6-100.1) and 6.41 (5.23-7.18) per 1000 patients, respectively. Moreover, we identified 11 CVAEs that were not reported in RCTs or cohort studies, acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and mobile thrombophlebitis etc. were strongly correlated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Furthermore, the risk of CVAEs varied depending on the specific CDK4/6 inhibitors used, its combination with different endocrine therapies, and the patient’s treatment stage.Interpretation CDK4/6 inhibitors increase the risk of CVAEs, some of which may lead to serious consequences, early recognition and management of CVAEs is of great importance in clinical practice."

Innovative implementation strategies are required to scale-up VMMC uptake.Methodology RITe was a multi-faceted intervention comprising transport reimbursement (R), intensified health education (IHE) and SMS/Telephone tracing (Te), which increased the uptake of VMMC among uncircumcised men with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Malawi. Using a concurrent exploratory mixed-method approach, we assessed the intervention’s acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness among men with STIs and healthcare workers (HCWs) at Bwaila District Hospital. Participants completed Likert scale surveys and participated in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). We calculated percentages of responses to survey items and summarized common themes using thematic analysis. Median scores and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated for acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness of each strategy at baseline and end-line and compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.Results A total of 300 surveys, 17 IDIs and 4 FGDs were conducted with men and HCWs between baseline and end-line. The mean age for men in the survey was 29 years (SD ±8) and most were married/cohabiting (59.3%). Mean age for HCWs was 38.5 years (SD ±7), and most were female (59.1%). For acceptability, participants agreed that RITe was welcome, approvable, and likable. Despite participants agreeing that RITe was a good idea, culture and religion influenced appropriateness, particularly at baseline, which improved at end-line for Te and R. For feasibility, HCWs agreed that RITe was easy to implement, but expressed concerns that R (end-line median = 4, IQR: 2, 4) and Te (end-line median = 4, IQR: 4, 4), were resource intensive, hence unsustainable. Interviews corroborated the survey results. Participants reported that IHE provided important information, Te was a good reminder and R was attractive, but they reported barriers to R and Te such as electricity, limited access to phones and distrust in the government.Conclusions The RITe intervention was acceptable, feasible and appropriate. However, culture/religion and structural barriers affected perceptions of appropriateness and feasibility, respectively. Continued awareness raising on VMMC and addressing setting-specific structural factors are required to overcome barriers that impede demand-creation interventions for VMMC.Study registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04677374.

Current methods have limitations, and as a result many women forego regular screening. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can overcome most of these limitations, but access to conventional MRI is not widely available for routine annual screening. Here, we used an MRI scanner operating at ultra-low field (ULF) to image the left breasts of 11 women (mean age, 35 years ±13 years) in the prone position. Three breast radiologists reviewed the imaging and were able to discern the breast outline and distinguish fibroglandular tissue (FGT) from intramammary adipose tissue. Additionally, the expert readers agreed on their assessment of the breast tissue pattern including fatty, scattered FGT, heterogeneous FGT, and extreme FGT. This preliminary work demonstrates that ULF breast MRI is feasible and may be a potential option for comfortable, widely deployable, and low-cost breast cancer diagnosis and screening."

A nationwide retrospective cohort of vagotomized individuals,"AbstractBackground and Objectives Emerging preclinical evidence suggests that vagal signals contribute to the development of schizophrenia-related abnormalities in brain and behavior. Whether vagal communication in general, and its impairment in particular, is a risk factor for schizophrenia in humans remains, however, unclear. Vagotomy, the surgical lesion of the vagus nerve, was routinely performed as a treatment for peptic ulcer before modern treatment options were available. Hence, the primary aim of this study was to investigate whether vagotomy modulates the subsequent risk of developing schizophrenia. Moreover, given the existence of diverse vagotomy techniques (i.e., “truncal” or “selective”), our secondary goal was to test whether the extent of denervation modulates the risk of schizophrenia.Methods Using a nationwide retrospective matched cohort design, we identified 8,315 vagotomized individuals from the Swedish National Patient Register during the period 1970-2020 and 40,855 non-vagotomized individuals matching for age, sex and type of peptic ulcer. The risk of being diagnosed with schizophrenia and associated psychoses (ICD10 codes F20-29) was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models, including death as competing risk.Results When considering all types of vagotomy together, vagotomy was not significantly associated with schizophrenia (HR: 0.91 [0.72; 1.16]). However, truncal vagotomy (which denervates all subdiaphragmatic organs) significantly increased the risk of developing schizophrenia by 69% (HR: 1.69 [1.08; 2.64]), whereas selective vagotomy (which only denervates the stomach) showed no significant association (HR: 0.80 [0.61; 1.04]).Discussion Our results provide epidemiological support for the hypothesis that impairments in vagal functions could increase the risk of schizophrenia. Notably, the finding that truncal but not selective vagotomy is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia raises the possibility that the activity of subdiaphragmatic non-gastric vagal branches may be of particular relevance for the development of schizophrenia."

Nevertheless, a surveillance system for NTM has not been established in most countries, thus requiring repeated, intermittent, and time-consuming cross-sectional nationwide surveys.Methods To establish a nationwide surveillance system for NTM-associated diseases, we aimed to develop a prototype computer system primarily designed to continuously estimate NTM-PD incidence using a bacteriological case-defining algorithm through an automatic process of integrating bacteriological data collected from microbiology laboratories across Japan. To validate the accuracy of our study results, we compared the distribution of pulmonary TB cases between our laboratory data and the national surveillance data, which is representative of the Japanese population.Results Our estimates implied a 17.7% increase in NTM-PD incidence from 15.8 [14.9–16.8] in 2013 to 19.2 [18.2–20.4] in 2017, per 100,000 population. Moreover, 93.0% of the identified NTM-PD cases were dominated by the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, and the proportion of M. abscessus species exceeded that of M. kansasii for the first time in Japan. We also revealed significant age and sex differences in NTM-PDs. Notably, we found similar characteristics between our laboratory data and national surveillance data covering almost the entire Japanese population.Conclusion These findings, despite being laboratory-based, are extrapolatable to the general population in Japan and provide evidence that supports our system as a viable alternative to the nationwide NTM surveillance system."

While these individuals are often monitored closely during pregnancy, they face significant barriers when transitioning to primary care following delivery, due in part to a lack of health care support for this transition.Objective To evaluate the impact of an intervention designed to improve postpartum primary care engagement by reducing patient administrative burden and information gaps.Design Individual-level randomized controlled trial.Setting One hospital-based and five community-based outpatient obstetric clinics affiliated with a large academic medical center.Participants Participants included English- and Spanish-speaking pregnant or recently postpartum adults with obesity, anxiety, depression, diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, gestational diabetes, or pregnancy-related hypertension, and a primary care clinician (PCP) listed in their electronic health record (EHR).Intervention A behavioral economics-informed intervention bundle, including default scheduling of postpartum PCP appointments and patient messages and reminders with tailored language.Main Outcome Completion of a PCP visit for routine or chronic condition care within 4 months of delivery.Results 360 patients were randomized (Control: N=176, Intervention: N=184). PCP visit completion within 4 months occurred in 22.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.4-28.8%) in the control group and 40.0% (95%CI 33.1-47.4%) in the intervention group. In regression models accounting for randomization strata, the intervention increased PCP visit completion by 18.7 percentage points (95%CI 10.7-29.1). The intervention also significantly decreased postpartum readmissions, increased receipt of blood pressure, weight, and mood screenings, and increased PCP-documented plans for contraception and mental health.Conclusions and Relevance The current lack of support for postpartum transitions to primary care is a missed opportunity to improve recently pregnant individual’s short- and long-term health. This study found that default PCP visit scheduling, tailored messages, and reminders can substantially improve postpartum primary care engagement for individuals with or at high risk for chronic disease. Efforts to reduce patient administrative burdens may be relatively low-resource, high-impact approaches to improving postpartum health and wellbeing.Trial Registration NCT05543265."

In 2019, an estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs, accounting for 32% of all global deaths. Among these deaths, 85% were due to heart attacks and strokes.Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) recovery after myocardial infarction (MI) is an important prognostic indicator, and patients who do not recover LVEF after MI are at high risk of sudden cardiac arrest events and death.Stem cell therapy holds promise for cardiovascular diseases, offering regenerative potential through cell differentiation. However, limited access exists for clinicians and patients. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of MiSaver (Myocardial Infarction Functional Saver), a prefabricated stem cell investigational product, in recent AMI patients. Findings contribute to advancing stem cell treatments, improving accessibility and patient outcomes.Methods Patients who were admitted for AMI within 7 days and had reduced LVEF (.45%) were eligible for the study. MiSaver were matched for blood group and administered in participants in cohorts of five, each receiving escalating dosages (0.5×10^7, 1.6×10^7, and 5.0×10^7 cells/kg, respectively). Patients were assessed for symptoms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and treatment-related adverse events (AE). LVEF measured by echocardiographic on admission, at 6 months, and at 12 months after treatment. Patients functional activity status evalution ( using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) and Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) classification systems.Results Out of the initially planned 15 participants, eleven were enrolled in the study. The trial was halted prematurely due to challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and impractical transportation logistics. Patients received MiSaver infusions within 2-5 days post-AMI onset. During the 12-month follow-up period, no study-related adverse events or signs of graft-versus-host disease were reported. At 12 months post-treatment, both the low and middle dose groups, as well as participant 11, showed improved LVEF, accompanied by enhanced Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class grades compared to baseline.Conclusion The intravenous infusion of MiSaver stem cells in AMI patients demonstrated safety and tolerability for low and middle dosage groups. The study provides promising insights into the potential of stem cells therapy in improving left ventricular function following AMI. However, further research with larger cohorts and a controlled placebo is warranted to confirm these findings and address limitations encountered during this trial."

In higher-risk myelodysplastic neoplasms (HR-MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CD8+ T cells exhibit altered functionality, however whether this affects disease course is poorly understood. Herein, we aimed to identify immune cell signatures in the bone marrow (BM) associated with disease progression and treatment outcomes. In-depth immunophenotypic analysis utilizing mass and flow cytometry on 104 pre-treatment BM samples from patients with myeloid neoplasms, revealed an increased frequency of a CD57+CXCR3+ subset of CD8+ T cells in patients with HR-MDS and AML who failed AZA therapy. Furthermore, increased baseline frequency (>29%) of the CD57+CXCR3+CD8+ T cell subset correlated with poor overall survival. We further engaged scRNA-seq to assess the transcriptional profile of BM CD8+ T cells from treatment-naïve patients. We observed an increased abundance of cells within cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL) cluster in secondary AML compared to HR-MDS. Additionally, response to AZA was positively associated with enrichment of IFN-mediated pathways, whereas enhanced TGF-β signaling signature in CTL clusters was observed in non-responders. Our results support that targeting of CD8+ T cells with inhibitors of TGF-β signaling in combination with AZA is a potential future therapeutic strategy in HR-MDS and AML."

We present the gut microbiome as a target for treatment and introduce microbiome-based biomarkers to guide personalized treatments. We show that not all persons with PD have a dysbiotic microbiome, and not all dysbiotic PD microbiomes have the same features. We have developed an intuitive and easily modifiable method to identify the optimal candidates for microbiome-based clinical trials, and subsequently, for treatments that are personalized for each individual’s dysbiotic features. We demonstrate the method for PD. The concept, and the method, is generalizable for any disease with a microbiome component."

Whether two rounds of MDA are necessary or sufficient and the optimal sampling strategies and endpoints for stopping MDA remain undefined.Methods and Findings Two cross-sectional studies were performed, one at baseline in 2019 before MDA-IDA, and 12 months post-MDA-IDA. Pre-MDA, we selected 49 sentinel villages for LF in East New Britain Province (ENBP, PNG) and randomly sampled ∼100 individuals/village of approximately equal number of children 6-9 years (N=1,906), and those ≥10 years (N=2,346) using population proportionate and purposeful sampling. LF infection was assessed by tests for circulating filarial antigenemia (CFA) and microfilariae (Mf). Children ages 6-9, 1.9% (37/1,906, range 0-21.6%) were CFA positive at baseline, and 0.3% (5/1,906; range 0-7.8%) were Mf positive. Individuals ≥10 years, 7.5% (176/2,346, range 0-52%) were CFA positive, and 2.0% (47/2,346, range 0-36%) were Mf positive. Twenty-four of 49 clusters were CFA ≥2%, and 14 had Mf prevalence ≥1%. Post-MDA (82% coverage), 47 clusters were selected based on geospatial modeling (N=4,610), of which 38 had >2% CFA compared to 24 identified at baseline. In the 24 villages evaluated pre- and post-MDA, we stratified the impact of MDA-IDA on children 6-9 and adults ≥18 years. Children had a 34% reduction in CFA prevalence and complete Mf clearance. Adults had a 39% reduction in CFA prevalence and a 96% reduction in Mf prevalence. Post-MDAx1 showed no villages that were Mf positive in two of four districts.Conclusions Geospatial modeling was more effective in sampling high-risk sites for LF than population-proportional sampling. The low LF prevalence in children and slight reduction of CFA prevalence limits its utility as a biomarker for LF elimination in children. A single round of MDA with IDA with high coverage was sufficient to reach elimination targets in villages with low baseline LF prevalence. Areas with higher baseline prevalence will require additional rounds of MDA, but this could be targeted to smaller evaluation units to reduce cost.Trial registration This study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov under the number NCT04124250Why was this study done?WHO has targeted lymphatic filariasis (LF) for global elimination as a public health problem using mass drug administration (MDA) as the primary intervention strategy.The WHO recently modified recommendations for MDA of LF with a combination of three co-administered drugs: ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole. This study examined the impact of one round of MDA on LF infection parameters in Papua New Guinea that had not previously received MDA for LF and examined new methodologies for monitoring and surveillance.What did the researcher do and find?Before MDA, we randomly sampled sentinel clusters (villages) using population proportional sampling of equal numbers of children 6-9 years and older children and adults using well-established LF infection parameters. Post-MDA, we selected sentinel villages using a geospatial modeling design and focused on sampling adults.Population-proportional sampling underestimated the overall LF infection because the infection was more common in less-densely populated rural areas. Sampling children 6-9 years of age was inefficient because of very low infection rates in this age group. Geospatial modeling was more effective than population proportional sampling for selecting areas at high risk for LF. One round of MDA with high coverage was highly effective for reducing microfilaremia prevalence to very low levels in most sampled villages, but CFA prevalence decreased less dramatically.What do these findings mean?Geospatial modeling and sampling adults for microfilaria are preferred methods for monitoring the impact of MDA with IDA.Results from this study suggest that one round of high-coverage MDA may be sufficient to interrupt LF transmission in areas with low baseline prevalence. Additional rounds of MDA can then be targeted to areas with higher LF prevalence, thus reducing program costs. This strategy requires high-quality baseline surveillance to capture the focality of LF infection and high-quality MDA. This approach may be especially useful in areas like Papua New Guinea, where MDA is logistically challenging."

Links between the two are plausible but poorly researched. Our aim was to inform future malnutrition management programmes by better understanding associations between MMH and the nutritional status of infants aged u6m. We conducted a health facility-based cross-sectional survey of 1060 infants in rural Ethiopia, between October 2020 and January 2021. We collected data on: MMH status (exposure) measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and infant anthropometry (outcome); length for age Z-score (LAZ), weight for age Z-score (WAZ), weight for length Z-score (WLZ), mid upper arm circumference (MUAC), head circumference for age Z-score (HCAZ) and lower leg length (LLL). Linear regression analysis was used to determine associations between exposure and outcome variables. Mean (SD) age was 13.4 (6.2) weeks. The median score for MMH problem was 0 (inter quartile range 0 - 2) and 29.5 and 11.2% reported minimal and mild to severe depression score of 1-4 and 5-25, respectively. Mean (SD) LAZ was -0.4 (1.4), WAZ -0.7 (1.3), WLZ -0.5 (1.2), MUAC 12.4 (1.3) centimetre, HCAZ 0.4 (1.3) and LLL 148 (13.9) millimetre. In adjusted analysis, minimal MMH problems was associated with infant LAZ marginally (β=-0.2; 95% CI: -0.4, 0.001) and LLL (β=-2.0; 95% CI: -3.8, -0.1), but not with other anthropometric measurements. Significant associations were not found between mild to severe depressive symptoms and infant anthropometric outcomes. Covariates positively associated with infant anthropometric measurements were higher wealth index with LAZ (β=0.08, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.13), WAZ (β=0.12, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.17), WLZ (β=0.09, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.13), MUAC (β=0.06, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.11), and HCAZ (β=0.07, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.12); higher maternal schooling with LAZ (β=0.24, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.43) and WAZ (β=0.24, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.41); female sex with WAZ (β=0.16, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.31) and HCAZ (β=0.16, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.31); higher maternal age with LLL (β= 0.29, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.52); and improved water, sanitation and hygiene status with MUAC (β=0.07, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.12) and LLL (β=0.64, 95% CI: 0.04, 1.24). Covariates negatively associated with infant anthropometric measurements include female sex with MUAC (β=-0.33, 95% CI: - 0.48, -0.18) and LLL (β=-2.51, 95% CI: -4.15, -0.87); higher household family size with WLZ (β=-0.08, 95% CI: -0.13, -0.02); exclusive breastfeeding with MUAC (β=-0.39, 95% CI: -0.55, - 0.24) and LLL (β=-7.37, 95% CI: -9.01, -5.75); and grandmother family support with WAZ (β=- 0.2, 95% CI: -0.3, -0.0001) and WLZ (β=-0.2, 95% CI: -0.4, 0.1). In conclusion, only minimal, but not mild, moderate or severe, maternal/caregivers’ depressive symptoms are associated with infant anthropometry outcomes. Whilst plausible relationship between maternal mental health problems and offspring nutritional status exist, we are not able to show this because of small number of participants with moderate to severe level of depression in our study population. Thus, further evidence to understand and establish robust relationship between maternal mental health and offspring nutritional status is required."

In brain tumor pathologies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical step that impacts the decision for invasive surgery, yet expert MRI tumor typing is inconsistent and misdiagnosis can reach levels as high as 85%. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) ML brain tumor models struggle with data overfitting and susceptibility to shortcut learning, further exacerbated in large-sized models with many tunable parameters. In a comparison with multiple SOTA models, our deep ML brain tumor diagnostics model, SIENNA, surpassed limitations in four key areas of prioritized minimal data preprocessing, an optimized architecture that reduces shortcut learning and overfitting, integrated inductive cross-validation method for generalizability, and smaller neural architecture. SIENNA is applicable across MRI machines and 1.5 and 3.0 Tesla, and achieves high average accuracies on clinical DICOM MRI data across three-way classification: 92% (non-tumor), 91% (GBM), and 93% (MET) with retained high F1 and AUROC values for limited false positives/negatives. SIENNA is a lightweight clinical-ready AGI framework compatible with future multimodal expanded data integration."

While facility-based HIV Testing Services (HTS) in Kenya are effective, emergency department (ED) delivery is limited, despite the potential to reach underserved persons.Methods This quasi-experimental prospective study evaluated implementation of the HIV Enhanced Access Testing in Emergency Departments (HEATED) at Kenyatta National Hospital ED in Nairobi, Kenya. The HEATED program was designed using setting specific data and utilizes resource reorganization, services integration and HIV sensitization to promote ED-HTS. KPs included sex workers, gay men, men who have sex with men, transgender persons and persons who inject drugs. PPs included young persons (18-24 years), victims of interpersonal violence, persons with hazardous alcohol use and those never previously HIV tested. Data were obtained from systems-level records, enrolled injured patient participants and healthcare providers. Systems and patient-level data were collected during a pre-implementation period (6 March - 16 April 2023) and post-implementation (period 1, 1 May - 26 June 2023). Additional, systems-level data were collected during a second post-implementation (period 2, 27 June – 20 August 2023).

For enrolled KPs/PPs, HTS increased from 4.6% pre-implementation to 72.3% post-implementation period 1 (RR=13.8, 95%CI:5.5-28.7, p<0.001). Systems and participant level data demonstrated successful adoption and implementation of the HEATED program. Through 16-weeks post-implementation a significant increase in ED-HTS delivery was maintained as compared to pre-implementation.Conclusions The HEATED program increased ED-HTS and augmented delivery to KPs/PPs, suggesting that broader implementation could improve HIV services for underserved persons, already in contact with health systems."

VIR-2482, an engineered human monoclonal antibody with extended half-life, targets a highly conserved epitope on the stem region of influenza A hemagglutinin, and may protect against seasonal and pandemic influenza.Methods This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study examined the safety and efficacy of VIR-2482 for seasonal influenza A illness prevention in unvaccinated healthy adults. Participants (N = 2977) were randomized 1:1:1 to receive VIR-2482 450 mg, VIR-2482 1200 mg, or placebo via intramuscular (IM) injection. Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were the proportions of participants with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)–confirmed influenza A infection and either protocol-defined influenza-like illness (ILI) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)–defined ILI or World Health Organization (WHO)–defined ILI, respectively.Results VIR-2482 450 mg and 1200 mg prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of protocol-defined ILI with RT-PCR–confirmed influenza A versus placebo (relative risk reduction [RRR], 3.8% [95% CI: −67.3, 44.6] and 15.9% [95% CI: −49.3, 52.3], respectively). At the 1200 mg dose, the RRRs in influenza A illness were 57.2% [95% CI: −2.5, 82.2] using CDC-ILI and 44.1% [95% CI: −50.5, 79.3] using WHO-ILI definitions, respectively. Serum VIR-2482 levels were similar regardless of influenza status; variants with reduced VIR-2482 susceptibility were not detected. Local injection-site reactions were mild and similar across groups.Conclusion VIR-2482 1200 mg IM was well tolerated but did not significantly prevent protocol-defined ILI. Secondary endpoint analyses suggest this dose may have reduced influenza A illness.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT05567783Key points Prophylactic administration of 1200 mg of VIR-2482, an engineered human monoclonal antibody targeting a highly conserved epitope on the stem region of influenza A hemagglutinin, did not significantly reduce risk of influenza-like illness from influenza A virus in healthy adults."

Using survey data from 239,866 individuals who tested positively for SARS-CoV2, we conducted a multi-ancestry GWAS of 80,289 cases of diarrhea occurring during acute COVID-19 infection (33.5%). Six loci (CYP7A1, LZFTl1- - CCR9, TEME182, NALCN, LFNG, GCKR) met genome-wide significance in a trans-ancestral analysis. The top significant GWAS hit mapped to the CYP7A1 locus, which plays an etiologic role in bile acid metabolism and is in high LD (r2= 0.93) with the SDCBP gene, which was previously implicated in antigen processing and presentation in the COVID-19 context. Another association was observed with variants in the LZTFL1–CCR9 region, which is a known locus for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. PheWAS showed a shared association across three of the six SNPs with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and its subtypes. Mendelian randomization showed that genetic liability to IBS-diarrhea increased (OR=1.40,95%,CI[1.33-1.47]), and liability to IBS-constipation decreased (OR=0.86, 95%CI[0.79-0.94]) the relative odds of experiencing COVID-19+ diarrhea. Our genetic findings provide etiological insights into the extrapulmonary manifestations of acute SARS-CoV2 infection."

As ambient artificial intelligence scribes and other LLM-based tools begin to be deployed within healthcare settings, rigorous evaluations of the accuracy of these technologies are urgently needed.Objective To investigate the performance of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo in generating Emergency Department (ED) discharge summaries and evaluate the prevalence and type of errors across each section of the discharge summary.Design Cross-sectional study.Setting University of California, San Francisco ED.Participants We identified all adult ED visits from 2012 to 2023 with an ED clinician note. We randomly selected a sample of 100 ED visits for GPT-summarization.Exposure We investigate the potential of two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo, to summarize the full ED clinician note into a discharge summary.Main Outcomes and Measures GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4-generated discharge summaries were evaluated by two independent Emergency Medicine physician reviewers across three evaluation criteria: 1) Inaccuracy of GPT-summarized information; 2) Hallucination of information; 3) Omission of relevant clinical information. On identifying each error, reviewers were additionally asked to provide a brief explanation for their reasoning, which was manually classified into subgroups of errors.Results From 202,059 eligible ED visits, we randomly sampled 100 for GPT-generated summarization and then expert-driven evaluation. In total, 33% of summaries generated by GPT-4 and 10% of those generated by GPT-3.5-turbo were entirely error-free across all evaluated domains. Summaries generated by GPT-4 were mostly accurate, with inaccuracies found in only 10% of cases, however, 42% of the summaries exhibited hallucinations and 47% omitted clinically relevant information. Inaccuracies and hallucinations were most commonly found in the Plan sections of GPT-generated summaries, while clinical omissions were concentrated in text describing patients’ Physical Examination findings or History of Presenting Complaint.Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study of 100 ED encounters, we found that LLMs could generate accurate discharge summaries, but were liable to hallucination and omission of clinically relevant information. A comprehensive understanding of the location and type of errors found in GPT-generated clinical text is important to facilitate clinician review of such content and prevent patient harm."

Gaps in house structures, most especially in eaves and windows, allow vector entry and facilitate indoor vector biting and disease burden. Simple house modification tools that target these structures therefore have the potential to reduce human exposure to bites in the home. This study assessed the performance of Insecticide Treated Screening (ITS) comprising Eave Nets and Window Screens (ITENs & ITWS), incorporated with deltamethrin and piperonyl-butoxide (PBO) in Tanzania.Method A randomised Latin square (4 X 4) was conducted in four experimental huts built in a semi-field system (SFS). Each hut within each of the chambers of the SFS was covered with a large netting cage to allow recapture of mosquitoes inside and outside of the huts. Four treatment arms were evaluated: 1) new ITS; 2) 12-months naturally-aged ITS; 3) estimated 12 months field-used Olyset® Plus ITNs (Standard-of-Care in Tanzania), and; 4) no treatment. The study was performed for 32 nights using a minimum of 30 mosquitoes per strain per night, that is, a total of 120 (4 x 30) mosquitoes per hut per night. Four laboratory-reared strains were used: transmitters of malaria (Anopheles arabiensis and An. funestus) and dengue infection (Aedes aegypti) and those known for nuisance biting (Culex quinquefasciatus). Recaptured mosquitoes were assessed for mortality at 72 hours (M72), blood feeding and hut entry endpoints. A simulation exercise with a modified mechanistic model tracking Plasmodium falciparum malaria was used to illustrate the potential epidemiological impact from these products.Results New ITS induced higher M72 than field-used ITNs against all mosquito species tested [OR: 2.25 (95%CI: 1.65-3.06), p<0.0001], while M72 was similar between aged ITS and field-used ITNs [OR: 0.80 (95%CI: 0.59-1.08), p=0.141]. Both new, and aged ITS reduced more mosquito blood feeding and hut entry than field-used ITNs for all mosquito species tested (p<0.0001). Transmission model estimates indicate epidemiological impacts of ITS may supersede those of ITNs at the population level. The model results indicate that the potency of these impacts depends on assumed intervention percentage cover, durability and mosquito bionomics.Conclusions ITS is an efficacious tool for controlling vectors transmitting malaria, and dengue, and those known for nuisance biting in a semi-field setting. Given the intervention’s simplicity, it should be considered as an additional (or stand-alone) tool alongside behavioural change educational efforts to encourage the repurposing of old ITNs for house screening."

This study introduces a novel approach to uncover moderate effect size (MES) genes in ASD, which individually do not meet the ASD liability threshold but collectively contribute when paired with specific other MES genes. Analyzing 10,795 families from the SPARK dataset, we identified 97 MES genes forming 50 significant gene pairs, demonstrating a substantial association with ASD when considered in tandem, but not individually. Our method leverages familial inheritance patterns and statistical analyses, refined by comparisons against control cohorts, to elucidate these gene pairs’ contribution to ASD liability. Furthermore, expression profile analyses of these genes in brain tissues underscore their relevance to ASD pathology. This study underscores the complexity of ASD’s genetic landscape, suggesting that gene combinations, beyond high impact single-gene mutations, significantly contribute to the disorder’s etiology and heterogeneity. Our findings pave the way for new avenues in understanding ASD’s genetic underpinnings and developing targeted therapeutic strategies."

There have been observed sex differences in serum vitamin C concentrations but the reason for this is not fully known. To understand how environmental factors like vitamin C intake interact with molecular processes, levels of metabolites can be used. Two metabolites associated with vitamin C are O-methylascorbate and ascorbic acid 2 sulfate. Past research has found there are genetic factors that influence these metabolite levels. Here, we aimed to investigate if there is effect modification by sex of these gene-metabolite associations and characterize the biological function of these interactions. We included individuals of European descent from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging with available genetic and metabolic data (n= 9004). We conducted a genome wide association study with and without a sex interaction using mixed linear models. We also investigated the biological function of the important gene-sex interactions found for each metabolite. Two genome-wide statistically significant (p-value < 5×10-8) interaction effects and several suggestive (p-value < 10-5) interaction effects were found. The suggestive interaction associations were mapped to several genes including HSD11B2, which is associated with sex hormones and AGRP that helps initiate hunger drive. By understanding the genetic factors that impact metabolites associated with vitamin C, we better understand its function in disease risk. In addition, highlighting genetic markers and genes whose effects are modified by sex can help to understand the mechanisms behind sex differences in vitamin C levels and guide further research."

Biological components associated with suicide include DNA modifications that lead to changes in gene expression. Common genetic variation and DNA methylation changes are some of the most frequent types of DNA findings associated with an increased risk for suicidal behavior. Importantly, the interplay between genetic predisposition and DNA methylation patterns is becoming more prevalent in genetic studies. We hypothesized that DNA methylation patterns in specific loci already genetically associated with suicide would be altered in individuals with bipolar disorder and a history of suicide attempt. To test this hypothesis, we searched the literature to identify common genetic variants (N=34) previously associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in individuals with bipolar disorder. We then created a customized sequencing panel that covered our chosen genomic loci. We profiled DNA methylation patterns from blood samples collected from bipolar disorder participants with suicidal behavior (N=55) and without suicidal behavior (N=51). We identified seven differentially methylated CpG sites and five differentially methylated regions between the two groups. Additionally, we found that DNA methylation changes in MIF and CACNA1C were associated with lethality or number of suicide attempts. Finally, we identified three meQTLs in SIRT1, IMPA2, and INPP1. This study illustrates that DNA methylation is altered in individuals with bipolar disorder and a history of suicide attempts in regions known to harbor suicide-related variants."

Little is known about recessive effects on common diseases, specifically for non-European ancestry. Genes & Health is a cohort of British Pakistani and Bangladeshi individuals with elevated rates of consanguinity and endogamy, making it suitable to study recessive effects. We imputed variants into 44,190 genotyped individuals, using two imputation panels: a set of 4,982 whole-exome-sequences from within the cohort, and the TOPMed-r2 panel. We performed association testing with 898 diseases from electronic health records. We identified 185 independent loci that reached standard genome-wide significance (p<5×10−8) under the recessive model and had p-values more significant than under the additive model. 140 loci demonstrated nominally-significant (p<0.05) dominance deviation p-values, confirming a recessive association pattern. Sixteen loci in three clusters were significant at a Bonferroni threshold accounting for multiple phenotypes tested (p<5.5×10−12). In FinnGen, we replicated 44% of the expected number of Bonferroni-significant loci we were powered to replicate, at least one from each cluster, including an intronic variant in PNPLA3 (rs66812091) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a previously reported additive association. We present novel evidence suggesting that the association is recessive instead (OR=1.3, recessive p=2×10−12, additive p=2×10−11, dominance deviation p=3×10−2, FinnGen recessive OR=1.3 and p=6×10−12). We identified a novel protective recessive association between a missense variant in SGLT4 (rs61746559), a sodium-glucose transporter with a possible role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and hypertension (OR=0.2, p=3×10−8, dominance deviation p=7×10−6).

We utilized the OneFlorida+ network’s data repository, conducting a retrospective analysis of CRC patients receiving FDA-approved first-line metastatic treatments. Propensity score matching created balanced case-control groups, which were evaluated using survival analysis and machine learning algorithms to assess the effects of eligibility criteria. Our study included 68,375 patients, with matched case-control groups comprising 1,126 patients each. Survival analysis revealed ethnicity and race, along with specific medical history (eligibility criteria), as significant survival outcome predictors. Machine learning models, particularly the XgBoost regressor, were employed to analyze SAEs, indicating that age and study groups were notable factors in SAEs occurrence. The study’s findings highlight the importance of considering patient demographics and medical history in CRC trial designs."

Two frequently used implants across registries were added, totalling 11 cups and 11 stems. Cumulative revision rates (CRR) and 95%CIs were extracted from the latest annual registry reports using these implants. CRRs were pooled for each cup or stem, and differences between cup-stem combinations and between registries were investigated.Results CRRs were available for 10 cups and 8 stems from 8 registries, totalling 552,148 cups and 727,447 stems. Follow-up was 1-20 years. Five-year CRRs pooled on all cups was 2.9% (95%CI 2.3 to 3.6) and on all stems 3.0% (95%CI 2.4 to 3.8). Homogenous (consistent) CRRs with respect to both, associated implant and country, were observed for 2 cups and 3 stems. Significant differences in CRR were identified in 1 cup by associated implant only, in 1 cup by registry only, and in 2 cups and 4 stems for both. Sparse data prevented evaluation of 4 cups and 1 stem.Conclusion Registries’ annual reports provide a large amount of publicly available information on CRRs of specific implants. These CRRs can be synthesized to improve the assessment of implant performance over time. Our CRR analysis represents a promising approach to detect implants with a consistent low- or high-risk pattern across registries."

Previous studies focusing on the association between concussion history and structural changes in the brain have reported inconsistent results. We sought to examine the effect of concussion history on cortical volume with a focus on functional networks. These networks are associated with many of the functions that can be disrupted in those with an extensive concussion history. Collegiate athletes (n=296) in the present study who self-reported concussion history did not report different baseline symptoms and did not exhibit consistent differences in cognitive performance relative to those who reported no concussion history. We found that concussion history was not related to cortical volume at the network or region level, even when we compared participants with two or more concussions to those with no concussion history. We did identify relationships between cortical volume in the visual network and dorsal attention network with cognitive performance. In addition to comparing cortical volume between individuals with and without reported concussion history, we also examined whether cortical volume changes could be observed within individuals from baseline to acutely following concussion. We found that network level cortical volume did not change within subjects from baseline measurement to acutely post-concussion. Together, these results suggest that both self-reported concussion history and acute concussion effects are not associated with changes in cortical volume in young adult athletes."

Genome-wide association studies of birth weight have highlighted associated variants in more than 200 regions of the genome, but the causal genes are mostly unknown. Rare genetic variants with robust evidence of association are more likely to point to causal genes, but to date, only a few rare variants are known to influence birth weight. We aimed to identify genes that harbour rare variants that impact birth weight when carried by either the fetus or the mother, by analysing whole exome sequence data in UK Biobank participants.We annotated rare (minor allele frequency <0.1%) protein-truncating or high impact missense variants on whole exome sequence data in up to 234,675 participants with data on their own birth weight (fetal variants), and up to 181,883 mothers who reported the birth weight of their first child (maternal variants). Variants within each gene were collapsed to perform gene burden tests and for each associated gene, we compared the observed fetal and maternal effects. We identified 8 genes with evidence of rare fetal variant effects on birth weight, of which 2 also showed maternal effects. One additional gene showed evidence of maternal effects only. We observed 10/11 directionally concordant associations in an independent sample of up to 45,622 individuals (sign test P=0.01).Of the genes identified, IGF1R and PAPPA2 (fetal and maternal-acting) have known roles in insulin-like growth factor bioavailability and signalling. PPARG, INHBE and ACVR1C (all fetal-acting) have known roles in adipose tissue regulation and rare variants in the latter two also showed associations with favourable adiposity patterns in adults. We highlight the dual role of PPARG in both adipocyte differentiation and placental angiogenesis. NOS3, NRK, and ADAMTS8 (fetal and maternal-acting) have been implicated in both placental function and hypertension.Analysis of rare coding variants has identified regulators of fetal adipose tissue and fetoplacental angiogenesis as determinants of birth weight, as well as further evidence for the role of insulin-like growth factors."

Recent findings in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging suggest that brain areas involved in this network interact with subcortical regions during spontaneous migraine attacks.Methods Patients with low-frequency episodic menstrual migraine without aura were assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a working memory task, along the four phases of natural migraine cycles, including spontaneous attacks, namely: peri-ictal (preictal, ictal, postictal) phases and interictally (in-between attacks). Healthy controls were assessed during the corresponding phases of their menstrual cycles.Results The protocol was completed by 24 female participants aged 21 to 47 years: 10 with migraine (four sessions each) and 14 controls (two sessions each). Patients and controls showed similar performance on the working memory task and displayed increased brain activity in regions linked to this function, namely the middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, and anterior cingulate cortex, during all phases of the migraine/menstrual cycle. Migraine patients exhibited a significant decrease in hypothalamic activity during the postictal phase when compared to perimenstrual controls (p = 0.007), interictal (p = 0.002) and preictal (p = 0.034) migraine phases.Conclusion Cognitive areas were actively recruited during a working memory task in different phases of the migraine cycle. In addition, migraine patients displayed significantly lower neural activity at the subcortical level in the peri-ictal period. These findings, combined with previous research showing activation in cortical areas, suggest subcortical-cortical interaction during the peri-ictal phases, which may act as a compensatory mechanism when the individual faces a cognitively demanding task during migraine attacks."

ChatGPT definitely changed the way we can communicate now with computers. We still remember the limitations of (voice) assistants, like Alexa or Siri, that were “overwhelmed” by a follow-up question after asking about the weather, not to mention even more complex questions, which they could not handle at all. ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) turned that in the meantime upside down. They allow fluent and continuous conversations on a human-like level with very complex sentences and diffused in the meantime into all kinds of applications and areas. One area that was not spared from this development, is the medical domain. An indicator for this is the medical search engine PubMed, which comprises currently more than 36 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. As of March 2024, the search term “ChatGPT” already returns over 2,700 results. In general, it takes some time, until reviews, and especially systematic reviews appear for a “new” topic or discovery. However, not for ChatGPT, and the additional search restriction to “systematic review” for article type under PubMed, returns still 31 contributions, as of March 19 2024. After filtering out non-systematic reviews from the returned results, 19 publications are included. In this meta-review, we want to take a closer look at these contributions on a higher level and explore the current evidence of ChatGPT in the medical domain, because systematic reviews belong to the highest form of knowledge in science."

Tools to synthesize genomic analysis with other types of data are a key requirement of genomic epidemiology. We propose a new ‘phylepic’ visualization that combines a phylogenomic tree with an epidemic curve. The combination visually links the molecular time represented in the tree to the calendar time in the epidemic curve, a correspondence that is not easily represented by existing tools. Using an example derived from a foodborne bacterial outbreak, we demonstrated that the phylepic chart communicates that what appeared to be a point-source outbreak was in fact composed of cases associated with two genetically distinct clades of bacteria. We provide an R package implementing the chart. We expect that visualizations that place genomic analyses within the epidemiological context will become increasingly important for outbreak investigations and public health surveillance of infectious diseases."

It is caused by mutations in RNU4ATAC whose transcript, the small nuclear RNA U4atac, is a core component of the minor spliceosome involved in the excision of minor introns spread over ∼750 genes.Here, we report a patient presenting with TALS features but no mutation in RNU4ATAC; instead, she carries the RTTN c.2953A>G variant at the homozygous state. This variant, already reported in patients with syndromic microcephaly, encodes the missense p.Arg985Gly amino acid change. It is also known to affect RTTN pre-mRNA splicing, with the expression of two forms lacking either exon 23 (in-frame) or exons 22-23 (out-of-frame). By using the engineered RTTN depleted RPE1 cellular model, we analysed independently the impact of the missense and in-frame deletion of exon 23 RTTN isoforms on the localisation and function of the protein at the centrosome, and showed that the pathogenicity of the c.2953A>G variant is mostly due to the latter. In patient fibroblasts, we observed a reduction of the centriole length and an alteration of ciliary function, while the analysis of neuronal stem cells (NSC) derived from CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells revealed major cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, leading to aneuploidy, cell cycle arrest and increased cell death. Finally, by generating cortical organoids, we discovered a new function of RTTN in the self-organisation of NSC into neural rosettes. We observed a delayed apico-basal polarization of NSC, accompanied with decreased cell division and increased apoptosis. Altogether, these defects lead to a marked decrease of rosette number and size in RTTN-mutated organoids, thus impeding their overall growth.To conclude, our study gives new insights on microcephaly-related pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the only recurrent RTTN mutation, that could also open a path to better understand those involved in RNU4ATAC-associated Taybi-Linder syndrome."

The case ascertainment rate (CAR), the proportion of infections that are reported as cases, is typically much less than one and varies with testing practices and behaviours, making reported cases unreliable as the sole source of data. The concentration of viral RNA in wastewater samples provides an alternate measure of infection prevalence that is not affected by clinical testing, healthcare-seeking behaviour or access to care.Methods We constructed a state-space model with observed data of levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and reported case incidence and estimated the hidden states of R and CAR using sequential Monte Carlo methods.Results Here, we analysed data from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2023 from Aotearoa New Zealand. Our model estimates that R peaked at 2.76 (95% CrI 2.20, 3.83) around 18 February 2022 and the CAR peaked around 12 March 2022. We calculate that New Zealand’s second Omicron wave in July 2022 was similar in size to the first, despite fewer reported cases. We estimate that the CAR in the BA.5 Omicron wave in July 2022 was approximately 50% lower than in the BA.1/BA.2 Omicron wave in March 2022.Conclusions Estimating R, CAR, and cumulative number of infections provides useful information for planning public health responses and understanding the state of immunity in the population. This model is a useful disease surveillance tool, improving situational awareness of infectious disease dynamics in real-time.Plain Language Summary To make informed public health decisions about infectious diseases, it is important to understand the number of infections in the community. Reported cases, however, underestimate the number of infections and the degree of underestimation likely changes with time. Wastewater data provides an alternative data source that does not depend on testing practices. Here, we combined wastewater observations of SARS-CoV-2 with reported cases to estimate the reproduction number (how quickly infections are increasing or decreasing) and the case ascertainment rate (the fraction of infections reported as cases). We apply the model to Aotearoa New Zealand and demonstrate that the second wave of infections in July 2022 had approximately the same number of infections as the first wave in March 2022 despite reported cases being 50% lower."

Patients with MDD have heterogeneous transdiagnostic subsets of symptoms with differing underlying neural aberrations. Therefore, better treatment response might be achieved using more customizable treatments. Showing promise for this, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can be used to directly target patient-specific underlying neural aberrations. As a major step in this direction, here we reproduce and extend, with a larger sample, our previous findings that a BMI technique called Functional Connectivity Neurofeedback (FCNef) can normalize neural aberrations related to specific MDD symptoms. For the first time, we show that normalization of the target neural activity (here, connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the precuneus) corresponds meaningfully more to reductions in corresponding than non-corresponding symptoms (here, significantly more to reductions in rumination than anxiety symptoms). Furthermore, we showed for the first time that this depended on the specific parameters that FCNef was run with. Specifically, normalization of the targeted neural activity and a corresponding reduction in related symptoms was greater with more external reward and with consecutive (compared to non-consecutive) days of training, but did not differ depending on whether participants were given shorter or longer time-windows to manipulate their neural activity. Overall, these findings demonstrate the promise of FCNef for precision medicine and highlight the importance of BMI parameter testing for enhancing the feasibility of actual clinical trials. Hereby, we inch closer to a future where signals from our own brains are used to guide our own individual medical interventions."

Given the association between cardiac complications and elevated risk of poor clinical outcomes after SAH, it is essential to characterize the cardiovascular effects of taVNS to ensure this approach is safe in this fragile population4. Therefore, we assessed the impact of both acute taVNS and repetitive taVNS on cardiovascular function in this study.Methods In this randomized clinical trial, 24 SAH patients were assigned to either a taVNS treatment or a Sham treatment group. During their stay in the intensive care unit, we monitored patient electrocardiogram (ECG) readings and vital signs. We compared long-term changes in heart rate, heart rate variability, QT interval, and blood pressure between the two groups. Additionally, we assessed the effects of acute taVNS by comparing cardiovascular metrics before, during, and after the intervention. We also explored rapidly responsive cardiovascular biomarkers in patients exhibiting clinical improvement.Results We found that repetitive taVNS did not significantly alter heart rate, corrected QT interval, blood pressure, or intracranial pressure. However, taVNS increased overall heart rate variability and parasympathetic activity from 5–10 days after initial treatment, as compared to the sham treatment. Acutely, taVNS increased heart rate, blood pressure, and peripheral perfusion index without affecting the corrected QT interval, intracranial pressure, or heart rate variability. The acute post-treatment elevation in heart rate was more pronounced in patients who experienced a decrease of more than 1 point in their Modified Rankin Score at the time of discharge.Conclusions Our study found that taVNS treatment did not induce adverse cardiovascular effects, such as bradycardia or QT prolongation, supporting its development as a safe immunomodulatory treatment approach for SAH patients. The observed acute increase in heart rate after taVNS treatment may serve as a biomarker for SAH patients who could derive greater benefit from this treatment.HighlightsTranscutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) treatment is a safe immunomodulatory treatment approach for subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.taVNS treatment did not induce adverse cardiovascular effects, such as bradycardia or QT prolongation.An acute increase in heart rate after taVNS treatment may serve as a biomarker for SAH patients who could derive greater benefit from this treatment."

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, a resurgence of invasive GAS (iGAS) infections has been documented, necessitating efficient outbreak detection methods. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) serves as the gold standard for GAS molecular typing, albeit constrained by time and costs. This study aimed to characterize the post-pandemic increased prevalence of iGAS on the molecular epidemiological level in order to assess whether new, more virulent variants have emerged, as well as to assess the performance of the rapid and cost-effective Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy as an alternative to WGS for detecting and characterizing GAS transmission routes. A total of 66 iGAS strains isolated from nine Swiss hospitals during the COVID-19 post-pandemic increased GAS prevalence were evaluated and compared to 15 strains collected before and 12 during the COVID-19 pandemic. FT-IR measurements and WGS were conducted for network analysis. Demographic, clinical, and epidemiological data were collected. Skin and soft tissue infection was the most common diagnosis, followed by primary bacteremia and pneumonia. Viral co-infections were found in 25% of cases and were significantly associated with more severe disease requiring intensive care unit admission. WGS analysis did not reveal emerging GAS genetic distinct variants after the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating the absence of a pandemic-induced shift. FT-IR spectroscopy exhibited limitations in differentiating genetically distant GAS strains, yielding poor overlap with WGS-derived clusters. The emm1/ST28 gebotype was predominant in our cohort and was associated with five of the seven deaths recorded, in accordance with the molecular epidemiological data before the pandemic. Additionally, no notable shift in antibiotic susceptibility patterns was observed. Our data suggest that mainly non-pathogen related factors contributed to the recent increased prevalence of iGAS."

A mouse model of spontaneous COPD [genetically deficient in surfactant protein-D (SP-D-/-)] and ozone (O3) exposure were used to examine the mechanism by which lack of functional SP-D may skew ILC2s to produce IL-17A in combination with IL-5 and IL-13, leading to a mixed inflammatory profile and more severe disease.Measurements and Main Results COPD was characterized by poor spirometry, sputum inflammation, and the emergence of sputum GATA3+ ILCs (ILC2s), but not T-bet+ ILCs (ILC1s) nor RORγt+ ILCs (ILC3s). COPD subjects with elevated sputum ILC2s (the ILC2high group) had worse spirometry and sputum neutrophilia and eosinophilia than healthy and ILC2low subjects. This was associated with the presence of dual-positive IL-5+IL-17A+ and IL-13+IL-17A+ ILCs and nonfunctional SP-D in the sputum in ILC2high subjects. SP-D-/- mice showed spontaneous airway neutrophilia. Lack of SP-D in the mouse lung licensed ILC2s to produce IL-17A, which was dose-dependently inhibited by recombinant SP-D. SP-D-/- mice showed enhanced susceptibility to O3-induced airway neutrophilia, which was associated with the emergence of inflammatory IL-13+IL-17A+ ILCs.Conclusions We report that the presence of sputum ILC2s predicts the severity of COPD, and unravel a novel pathway of IL-17A plasticity in lung ILC2s, prevented by the immunomodulatory protein SP-D."

Using 2019-2023 data from Truveta, this study demonstrated that while the incidence of syphilis increased from 2020 to 2022, it started to decline in 2023. The decline was driven by population subgroups that are commonly considered higher-risk for syphilis infection. Findings also highlighted growing trends among lower-risk population subgroups."

Despite the high incidence of approximately 15 million preterm births worldwide per year, there is a lack of sufficient strategies for predicting and preventing preterm labor. Here, we found that exosomal miRNAs in maternal vaginal discharge can serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis of life-threatening conditions in both the mother and neonate. Our non-invasive biopsy of vaginal discharge using a swab allows us to isolate enriched exosomes via an advanced microfluidic platform called BEST (Biologically intact Exosome Separation Technology). We have identified specific miRNAs differentially expressed in mothers with preterm labor compared to those with full-term mothers. These miRNAs included hsa-miR-206, which was up-regulated in preterm labor, and hsa-miR-3674, hsa-miR-365a-5p, and hsa-miR-193b-3p, which were down-regulated. We believe our discovery of unique miRNAs as biomarkers can aid in early detection and effective treatment of preterm labor, potentially revolutionizing global healthcare."

However, it remains unknown whether acute stroke patients are capable of error-based motor adaptation learning and, if so, whether such learning may be enhanced by reinforcement feedback. Here, we show for the first time that acute stroke patients exhibit successful error-based motor adaptation with their paretic hand by replicating well-known phenomena such as savings and retention of adaptation learning. Notably, reward and punishment feedback exerted dissociative modulatory effects on motor adaptation. Contrary to findings in healthy subjects and chronic stroke patients, punishment did not enhance learning rates during early adaptation but led to poorer performance than reward. Most importantly, reward feedback enhanced both initial learning and retention, emphasizing the potential of reward and discouraging punishment feedback in early neurorehabilitation after stroke."

Access to sexual and reproductive health information enables women to make informed health decisions. However, the low modern contraceptive prevalence among women in northern Nigeria may be attributed to poor FPC and exposure to FP messages, among other factors. This study examines the impact of quality FPC and exposure to FP messages on modern contraceptive use.Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 676 family planning clients aged 15-49 from 163 health facilities in Northern Nigeria. Quantitative data were collected using client exit interviews. The analysis included a binary logistic regression to predict the odds of modern contraceptive use using MII Plus and other explanatory variables.Result Only 29% received quality counselling about methods, while 35% were exposed to FP messages. The quality of counselling assessed using MII Plus did not predict modern contraceptive use. However, higher odds of using modern contraceptives were found among clients who reported their provider asked about their previous family planning experience (aOR=3.81; 95% CI: 1.04-13.99) and explained how the selected FP method works (aOR=5.51; 95% CI: 1.11-27.30). Clients who received FP messages from a place of worship (aOR=11.97; 95% CI: 1.76-81.62) and a community ruler (aOR=6.52; 95% CI: 1.02-41.58) had higher odds of using modern contraceptives.Conclusion Improving the quality of FPC and expanding exposure to FP messages through effective community structure can enhance the uptake of modern contraceptives in northern Nigeria."

This study presents mass testing strategies developed through machine learning models, which predict the risk of COVID-19 contagion based on health determinants. Using the data from the 2021 “Actualidades” survey in Costa Rica, we trained models to classify individuals by contagion risk. After theorize four possible strategies, we evaluated these using Monte Carlo simulations, analyzing the distribution functions for the number of tests, positive cases detected, tests per person, and total costs. Additionally, we introduced the metrics, efficiency and stock capacity, to assess the performance of different strategies. Our classifier achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.80 and an AUC-PR of 0.59, considering a disease prevalence of 0.26. The fourth strategy, which integrates RT-qPCR, antigen, and RT-LAMP tests, emerged as a cost-effective approach for mass testing, offering insights into scalable and adaptable testing mechanisms for pandemic response."

Here we report binding index of 305 HLA class I molecules from 18,771 unique haplotypes of 28,104 individuals to 821 peptides experimentally observed from spike protein RBD of 5 main SARS-CoV-2 strains hydrolyzed by human proteasomes with constitutive and immune catalytic phenotypes. Our data read that mutations in the hACE2-binding region RBD496-513 of Omicron B.1.1.529 strain results in a dramatic increase of proteasome-mediated release of two public HLA class I epitopes. Global population analysis of HLA class I haplotypes, specific to these peptides, demonstrated decreased mortality of human populations enriched in these haplotypes from COVID-19 after but not before December, 2021, when Omicron became dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain. Noteworthy, currently circulating BA.2.86 and JN.1 lineages contain no amino acid substitutions in RBD496-513 thus preserving identified core epitopes."

This study investigates the impact of pregnancy intention at conception on CoC in maternal healthcare service use in Somalia.Methods Data comprising 7,079 mothers were extracted from the First National Health and Demographic Survey of Somalia conducted in 2020, with the condition that they had given birth within the three years preceding the survey. Level of Continuity of Care (CoC), categorized as lowest, middle, or highest, in receiving maternal healthcare services, was considered as the explanatory variable and assessed based on the receipt of antenatal healthcare (ANC, <4, ≥4), skilled birth attendance (SBA), and postnatal healthcare (PNC, within 48 hours of birth). Mother’s intention of most recent pregnancy at conception was the primary exposure variable. Unadjusted and adjusted multilevel multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of unintended pregnancy on the level of CoC completion.Results Approximately 38% of live births in Somalia were unintended at conception. Only 2.4% of mothers achieved full CoC, with higher rates observed among those with intended pregnancies (3.0%) compared to those with mistimed (1.6%) or unwanted pregnancies (1.1%). Mothers having mistimed (aOR, 0.59, 95% CI, 0.37-0.95) and unwanted (aOR, 0.28, 95% CI, 0.10-0.79) pregnancies had significantly lower odds of achieving moderate and higher levels of CoC compared to those having intended pregnancies, even after adjusting for socio-demographic factors.Conclusion Unintended pregnancies are associated with lower level of CoC in maternal healthcare service use in Somalia. Strengthening family planning services, promoting contraceptive use, enhancing sexual education, and raising awareness about the importance of maternal healthcare services are essential steps to reduce unintended pregnancies and improve maternal and child health outcomes in the country."

However, ancestral spirituality in healthcare in the local context, remains sparse and elusive since most literature relates spirituality with religion and religious practices. The study sought to explore the beliefs in ancestral spirits utilized for health management among practicing Baganda traditional spiritual healers (Balubaale). Qualitative data were gathered through semi-structured in-depth interviews and partial integration observation methods from twelve (10M, 2F) purposively selected and recruited Balubaale from Central Uganda between 15th July 2019 and 29th April 2020, and we prospectively interacted with them for 24 months. Transcribed data was coded and thematically analyzed using ATLAS ti. 22 computer software based on grounded theory approach. Data revealed themes related to beliefs in spiritual powers of categories of ancestral spirits, sacred places, living plants and animals, non-living things such as fire, water, the Sun, and non-materials such as symbols and colors. Spiritual powers can be potentiated through rituals, sacrifice and communal activities all of which are utilized during health managements. In conclusion, Balubaale believe that illness and health management are influenced by ancestral spirits and spiritual powers contained in nature and creation therein. We recommend more exploratory studies among spiritualists of other tribes to contrast the findings."

Bacteria are the most common causative agents for otitis media. Currently, there is little information on the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogenic bacterial isolates from patients with otitis media in Ethiopia.Methodology A laboratory – based cross-sectional study was conducted from June to September 2023 among 242 patients with otitis media referred to Nekemte Public Health Research and Referral Laboratory Center. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained by trained nurses and/or health officers in face-to-face interviews using structured questionnaires. Middle ear discharge samples were collected by trained clinical microbiology experts following all aseptic techniques. Conventional culture, different biochemical tests and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed for all the isolated bacteria. Reference strains were used as a positive and negative controls. The data were checked for completeness and consistency, entered into EpiData version 4.6.06 and analyzed by SPSS version 25. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the associated factors of otitis media. Adjusted odds ratio was used to determine strength of association. Statistical significance was obtained at p-value of below 0.05. The data were interpreted using graphs, tables, and results statements.Results A total of 242 middle ear discharge samples were collected and cultured from which 212 (87.6%) were culture positive. A total of 228 pathogenic bacterial isolates were recovered. The predominant bacterial isolates were S. aureus 92 (40.4%) followed by P. aeruginosa 33 (14.5%) and E. coli 24 (10.5%). One hundred fifty-one (66.2%) bacterial pathogens were multidrug resistant. Piperacillin-tazobactam and tobramycin are relatively common drugs to which most of the isolates were susceptible while ampicillin and tetracycline were the most resistant. Purulent discharge (p-value = 0.001), middle ear discharge ≥14 days (P-value = 0.000) and a history of active/passive smoking (P-value = 0.043) were significantly associated with otitis media.Conclusion The prevalence of bacterial pathogens, most of which were multidrug-resistant, was high among patients with otitis media. A significant association was observed with purulent ear discharge, chronic otitis media, and passive or active smoking. Choosing the proper antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infection is crucial."

These seizures often originate from limbic networks and people also experience chronic comorbidities related to memory, mood, and sleep (MMS). Deep brain stimulation targeting the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS) is a proven therapy, but the optimal stimulation parameters remain unclear. We developed a neurotechnology platform for tracking seizures and MMS to enable data streaming between an investigational brain sensing-stimulation implant, mobile devices, and a cloud environment. Artificial Intelligence algorithms provided accurate catalogs of seizures, interictal epileptiform spikes, and wake-sleep brain states. Remotely administered memory and mood assessments were used to densely sample cognitive and behavioral response during ANT-DBS. We evaluated the efficacy of low-frequency versus high-frequency ANT-DBS. They both reduced seizures, but low-frequency ANT-DBS showed greater reductions and better sleep and memory. These results highlight the potential of synchronized brain sensing and behavioral tracking for optimizing neuromodulation therapy."

This fallacy occurs when coefficient estimates in multivariable regression models, apart from that of the primary exposure, are interpreted as total effects on the outcome. Causal diagrams can be used to identify sets of covariates that, when adjusted for, allow for unbiased estimation and correct interpretation of multiple total effects of interest. However, proper investigation of multiple total effects requires fitting several regression models and conducting multiple inferences. As the number of inferences increases, so does the rate of a false positive finding, a phenomenon known as multiplicity. While multiple comparison procedures are recognized as a critical consideration of randomized controlled trials, opinion remains divided on their use within observational studies. This commentary highlights how multiplicity may arise alongside the Table 2 Fallacy, and how causal diagrams can be used in conjunction with multiple comparison procedures to simultaneously avoid this fallacy, control the risk of spurious findings, and further align the best practices of experimental and observational studies."

This synthetic population defines individual agents with multiple attributes, among them age, gender, home and work locations, pre-existing health conditions, and socio-economic and employment status. BharatSim’s domain-specific language provides a framework for the simulation of diverse models. Its computational core, coded in Scala, supports simulations of a large number of individual agents, up to 50 million. Here, we describe the design and implementation of BharatSim, using it to address three questions motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic in India: (i) When can schools be safely reopened given specified levels of hybrid immunity?, (ii) How do new variants alter disease dynamics in the background of prior infections and vaccinations? and (iii) How can the effects of varied non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) be quantified for a model Indian city? Through its India-specific synthetic population, BharatSim allows disease modellers to address questions unique to this country. It should also find use in the computational social sciences, potentially providing new insights into emergent patterns in social behaviour.Author summary Agent-based simulations provide granular ways of describing the dynamics of each individual in a population. Such models are especially useful in describing the spread of an infectious disease, since they can be used to incorporate individual-level heterogeneity in behaviour and susceptibilities, as well as spatio-temporal information. BharatSim is such an agent-based modelling framework for India. It can simulate populations at multiple scales, from a few hundreds to several millions. It creates and uses a predefined synthetic population for India, assimilating it into a simulation framework. The synthetic population defines individuals with multiple attributes, among them age, sex, home, and work locations. We demonstrate the use of BharatSim in three contexts related to the COVID-19 pandemic in India."

Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that detection of heteroplasmy increases with participant age3, a phenomenon that has been attributed to genetic drift4–7. In this first large-scale longitudinal study, we measured heteroplasmy in two prospective cohorts (combined n=1405) at two timepoints (mean time between visits, 8.6 years), demonstrating that deleterious heteroplasmies were more likely to increase in variant allele fraction (VAF). We further demonstrated that increase in VAF was associated with increased risk of overall mortality. These results challenge the claim that somatic mtDNA mutations arise mainly due to genetic drift, instead demonstrating positive selection for predicted deleterious mutations at the cellular level, despite an negative impact on overall mortality."

The aim of this study was to comprehensively characterize changes in burden of opioid-overdose mortality in terms of life expectancy reduction and years of life lost between 2019-2021, including differential burden across demographic groups and the contribution of polysubstance use.Methods Using life tables and counts for all-cause and opioid overdose deaths from the National Center for Health Statistics, we constructed cause-eliminated life tables to estimate mortality by age in the absence of opioid-related deaths. We calculated the loss in life expectancy at birth (LLE) and total years of life lost (YLL) due to opioid overdose deaths by state, sex, racial/ethnic group, and co-involvement of cocaine and psychostimulants.Findings Opioid-related deaths in the US led to an estimated 3·0 million years of life lost in 2021 (37 years per death), compared to 2·0 million years lost in 2019. Relative to a scenario with no opioid mortality, we estimate that opioid-related deaths reduced life expectancy nationally by 0·65 years in 2021 vs 0·52 years in 2019. This LLE worsened in nearly all demographic groups during the study period: 0·76y to 1y for white men, 0·36y to 0·5y for white women, 0·59y to 0·96y for Black men, 0·27y to 0·43y for Black women, 0·3y to 0·73y for Hispanic men, 0·19y to 0·4y for Hispanic women, 0·62y to 1y for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) men, 0·43y to 0·9y for (AI/AN) women, and 0·09y to 0·13y for Asian men. Nearly all states experienced an increase in years of life lost (YLL) per capita from 2019-2021, with YLL more than doubling in 10 states. Cocaine or psychostimulants with abuse potential (incl. methamphetamines) were involved in nearly half of all deaths and years of life lost in 2021, with substantial variation in the predominant drug class by state and racial/ethnic group.Interpretation The burden of opioid-related mortality increased dramatically in the US between 2019-2021, coinciding with the period of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated disruptions to social, economic, and health systems. Opioid overdose deaths are an important contributor to decreasing US life expectancy, and Black, Hispanic, and indigenous Americans now experience mortality burdens approaching or exceeding white Americans.Funding NoneEvidence before this study The opioid crisis in the US is increasing in severity, with more opioid overdose deaths occurring each year. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar with the terms “opioid epidemic”, “opioid crisis”, “opioid overdoses”, or “opioid mortality” to identify studies evaluating the progression of opioid mortality around the world, and in particular in the US. We used the additional terms “stimulants”, “psychostimulants” or “polysubstance use” to find studies of the increasing polysubstance use, and we used the additional terms “demographic”, or “race and ethnicity” to find studies of the shifting demographics. We used the additional terms “life expectancy” or “life years lost” to find studies estimating these metrics of burden. When finding relevant papers through these searches, we also looked at their citations, as well as the authors’ other publications.Previous work has established that opioid mortality is a rapidly-changing public health crisis in the US. The years of life lost to opioid overdose deaths have been estimated at various stages of this crisis, and for various subpopulations. One study estimated 1.7 million years of life lost to opioid overdoses in the US in 2016, compared to more recent work finding 2.9 million years lost to unintentional opioid overdoses alone in 2021. Another study estimated that the US population lost 0.36 years in life expectancy as a result of opioid overdose deaths in 2016. However, we could not find estimates of the impact of opioid overdose deaths on US life expectancy or years of life lost in recent years, or comprehensive comparisons of these metrics across demographic groups. We also could not find studies estimating the contributions of the increasing co-involvement of stimulants and opioids to these metrics.Added value of this study We used all-cause and opioid-related mortality counts to estimate the impact of opioid overdose deaths on life expectancy at birth each year from 2019-2021, using cause-eliminated life tables. We found that opioid-related mortality in 2021 reduced US life expectancy by 0.65 years (compared to 0·52 years in 2019), and resulted in the loss of 3 million years of life (compared to 2 million years lost in 2019) or 37 life years lost per individual death (39 in 2019). We estimated these metrics of burden comprehensively across demographic groups, finding up to 10-fold variation by race/ethnicity and sex or by state. We observed increases in nearly all groups from 2019-2021; nationally, years of life lost increased from 38% among white women to 92% among American Indian/Alaska Native women. The loss in life expectancy at birth was worst amongst AI/AN and white men, at 1 year. We also quantified the contribution of polysubstance use to these metrics of burden, finding that in 2021 polysubstance use of opioids in combination with stimulants was responsible for nearly half the years of life lost to opioid-related deaths.Implications of all the available evidence Our findings build on prior work to highlight the substantial contribution of opioid-related deaths to the decreases in life expectancy in the US. The young age at which opioid overdose deaths occur - compared to other leading causes of death in the US - amplifies the impact of this crisis on overall life expectancy and life years lost. Our results and previous evidence confirm that the demographics of the opioid crisis have shifted in recent years and that the mortality burden of opioid overdoses is now increasing across all demographic groups in the US. Additionally, the growing co-involvement of stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine with opioids is leading to a considerable loss of life. Understanding the mortality burden and the populations at highest risk is crucial for effectively implementing and delivering treatments.Despite substantial federal and local investments to slow the opioid crisis over the past decade, including expansions to opioid-use-disorder treatments included in COVID-19 response and recovery funding, opioid overdose mortality has only accelerated in recent years. Transformative policy approaches to the opioid crisis are urgently needed to overturn the trends of decreasing life expectancy and to avoid the annual loss of millions of years of life."

Despite their significant disease burden, RV epidemiology at national levels is underexplored. The circulation patterns of RV types throughout a population and the role of virus genotype in this distribution are ill-defined. We generated 803 VP4/VP2 gene sequences from rhinovirus-positive samples collected from ARI patients, including both in-patient and outpatient cases, between 1st January and 31st December 2014 from eleven surveillance sites across Kenya and used phylogenetics to characterise virus introductions and spread. RVs were detected throughout the year, with the highest detection rates observed from January to March and June to July. We detected a total of 114 of the 169 currently classified types. Our analysis revealed numerous virus introductions into Kenya characterized by local expansion and extinction, and extensive spatial mixing of types within the country due to the widespread transmission of the virus after an introduction. This work demonstrates that in a single year, the circulation of rhinovirus in Kenya was characterized by substantial genetic diversity, multiple introductions, and extensive geographical spread."

To address the lack of tools and methods to study GI regions that are difficult to access, Nimble Science developed a fully autonomous and passive sampling method, the Small Intestine MicroBiome Aspiration (SIMBATM) capsule, for convenient, high-quality, and reliable sampling to study the diet-microbiota interactions in the SI. The sealing efficacy and microbial DNA preservation capacity of the SIMBA capsules was first validated through in vitro simulation assays. Then, a clinical study was conducted with 20 healthy participants to validate the in vivo use of SIMBA capsules to reliably capture samples for SI microbiome analysis before and after an intervention (NCT04489329). Briefly, participants ingested the capsules at baseline and 7 days later, with a probiotic capsule containing a blend of L. rhamnosus R0011 and B. longum R0175. Following baseline SIMBA capsule ingestion, multiple low-dosage x-ray scans were performed to track the sampling location. Fecal samples corresponding with the baseline and intervention capsule were analyzed for comparison. The SIMBA capsules’ performance in vitro demonstrated the potential for contamination-free sampling with preservation of the microbial communities. Within the clinical study, the capsules performed safely and reliably for collection of SI content. X-ray tracking confirmed that 97.2% of the capsules completed sample collection in the SI regions before reaching the colon. Importantly, our data showed that the capsules sampled in the right area of the intestines and that baseline SIMBA microbiome profile is significantly different from fecal microbiome profile. SIMBA successfully detected a concurrent probiotic intervention in the small intestine, which was not detectable using stool samples. The high accuracy of sampling location and sealing efficacy of the SIMBA capsules makes them potentially useful research tools in clinical trials for studying diet-microbiota interactions in health and disease, and perhaps eventually for the clinical diagnosis of GI tract conditions affecting the SI such as SIBO."

However, their detection in targeted sequenced tumors is hampered by sparse mutations and variability in targeted gene panels. Here we present SATS, a scalable mutational signature analyzer addressing these challenges by leveraging tumor mutational burdens from targeted gene panels. Through analyzing simulated data, pseudo-targeted sequencing data generated by down-sampling whole exome and genome data, and samples with matched whole genome sequencing and targeted sequencing, we showed that SATS can accurately detect common mutational signatures and estimate signature burdens. Applying SATS to 111,711 targeted sequenced tumors from the AACR Project GENIE, we generated a pan-cancer catalogue of mutational signatures tailored to targeted sequencing, enabling estimation of signature burdens within individual tumors. Integrating signatures with clinical data, we demonstrated SATS’s clinical utility, including identifying signatures enriched in early-onset hypermutated colorectal cancers and signatures associated with cancer prognosis and immunotherapy response."

To evaluate the clinical value of three ophthalmic anti-VEGF drugs in the treatment of fundus lesions diseases, to guide the rational use of the clinic. Inpatients with fundus lesions who had intravitreal injections of Aflibercept, Conbercept and Leizumab during 2020 were studied and six indicators were selected for a comprehensive evaluation. In terms of safety, Aflibercept, Conbercept, and Leizumab experienced adverse effects of elevated Intraocular Pressure (IOP). In terms of effectiveness, Leizumab was strong, that of Aflibercept was stronger and that of Conbercept was weaker. In terms of economic, there was no significant difference in the cost of Aflibercept, Conbercept and Leizumab and a significant difference in the total treatment cost and the cost of surgery. In terms of appropriateness, Aflibercept was more suitable than Conbercept, and there was no significant difference between Leizumab and Aflibercept. In terms of accessibility, Aflibercept, Conbercept and Leizumab were all accessible to urban residents in Henan Province. For rural people, these are unreachable. In terms of innovation, Aflibercep was the most innovative, followed by Leizumab and finally Conbercept. In terms of effectiveness and accessibility, Leizumab performed best compared to Aflibercept and Conbercept. In terms of accessibility and innovation, Aflibercept performed best compared to Conbercept and Leizumab. In terms of safety and economic, Aflibercept, Conbercept and Leizumab performed comparably."

GBA-PD has been associated with worse progression and higher risk of cognitive decline. Here we took advantage of the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) to investigate whether sex could interact with GBA1 carrier status in determining the clinical phenotype, with a special focus on cognitive decline.Methods We evaluated 118 PD subjects carrying GBA1 variants (GBA-PD) and 450 with wild-type alleles (nonGBA-PD) included in the PPMI. Dopaminergic activity was assessed in a subset of 248 subjects (65%) with available 123I-FP-CIT SPECT scans. Clinical features and dopaminergic activity were investigated in GBA-PD vs. nonGBA-PD groups, upon stratification by sex. PD subjects were followed for up to 6.5Dyears (median 6Dyears). Cox regression was used to model the hazard ratio (HR) of (1) GBA1 genotype, (2) sex, (3) gene-by-sex interaction on cognitive decline at follow-up.Results Regardless of genotype, men suffering from PD exhibited higher motor disability while women showed more autonomic dysfunction. At baseline, GBA-PD showed more severe motor and non-motor features, and reduced dopamine uptake in the bilateral ventral putamen compared to nonGBA-PD. Within the GBA-PD group, males had higher occurrence of REM sleep behavior disorder and memory deficits. Of note, GBA-PD females showed a greater striatal dopaminergic deficit compared to males, despite presenting similar motor impairment. In longitudinal assessment, Cox Regression revealed that male sex (HR = 1.7), GBA1 carrier status (HR =1.6) and, most importantly, GBA-by-male sex interaction (HR = 2.3) were significantly associated with a steeper cognitive decline. Upon stratification for GBA1 variant class, both “severe” and “mild” variants were associated with increased risk of cognitive decline, again more relevant in males (HR = 2.3).Discussion We show, for the first time, that male sex and GBA1 carrier status have an additive value in increasing the risk of cognitive decline in PD, despite the heightened dopaminergic vulnerability observed in GBA-PD females. The effect of sex on GBA1-related pathology warrants further examination and should be considered in future trials design and patients’ selection."

Obesity impacts the risk of severe dengue disease; however, the impact on dengue virus (DENV) infection and dengue cases remains an open question.Methods We used 9 years of data from 5,940 children in the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study in Nicaragua to examine whether pediatric obesity is associated with increased susceptibility to DENV infection and symptomatic presentation. Analysis was performed using Generalized Estimating Equations adjusted for age, sex, and pre-infection DENV antibody titers.Results From 2011 to 2019, children contributed 26,273 person-years of observation, and we observed an increase in the prevalence of overweight (from 12% to 17%) and obesity (from 7% to 13%). There were 1,682 DENV infections and 476 dengue cases in the study population. Compared to participants with normal weight, participants with obesity had higher odds of DENV infection (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.42) and higher odds of dengue disease given infection (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.15-2.19). Children with obesity infected with DENV showed increased odds of presenting fever (aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.05-2.02), headache (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07-2.14), and rash (aOR 2.26, 95% CI 1.49-3.44) when compared with children with normal weight.Conclusions Our results indicate that obesity is associated with increased susceptibility to DENV infection and dengue cases in children, independently of age, sex, and pre-infection DENV antibody titers.Key points We describe a doubling in the prevalence of obesity in a cohort of 5,940 Nicaraguan children followed over 9 years. Children with obesity were more likely to be infected with dengue virus and had higher risk of developing dengue disease."

Like most parts of Africa, women’s status in Tanzania remains contentious, with an estimated 19% prevalence of health decision-making autonomy in 2015. Given that women’s health decision-making autonomy is an ongoing process affected by technological and economic growth and social and cultural changes, understanding the sociodemographic correlates of women’s autonomy is imperative.Objective To examine the factors associated with health decision-making autonomy on their own health among Tanzanian women aged 15-49.Methods A non-experimental cross-sectional study using secondary data from the current Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey (TDHS-MIS) 2022-2023. The R statistical programming language was used to run the analysis. Chi-square and Ordinal Logistic Regression were fitted to identify the sociodemographic characteristics associated with women’s health decision-making autonomy on their own health. The odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval was used to determine the significance level at p-value <0.05. All estimates were adjusted for sample design (sample weight, strata, and sampling units)Results A total of 9,249 women were included in the analysis. Only 1,908 (21%) had complete autonomy, 4,933 (53%) had joint autonomy, and 2,408 (26%) had no autonomy. Women’s age, education level, household wealth index, and living in the South West Highlands zone were factors independently associated with higher odds of complete autonomy in their own healthcare. Rural residence was associated with decreased odds of complete autonomy.Conclusion These results show that health decision-making autonomy among Tanzanian women remains very low. Efforts to empower women through better education and means to improve their economic status are needed to increase complete health decision-making autonomy on their health.Recommendation Accelerated and concerted efforts to increase health decision-making autonomy among married women will eventually improve their health and well-being and that of society.Future implication The findings can serve as a basis for exploratory qualitative research to further understand the process of health decision-making autonomy among Tanzanian women."

Hence, many health facilities were providing second-line antiretroviral therapy, however little was known about viral load suppression among second-line users. This study aimed to assess the proportion of viral load suppression and associated factors among HIV-infected patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy at public health facilities of west Guji, Guji and Borena zones, Southern Ethiopia.Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 256 HIV-infected patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy from January 1, 2019, to December 30, 2022, by using census after obtaining ethical clearance from Bule Hora University ethical review committee. Data were extracted using a structured, pre-tested checklist, entered into the EPI data version 3.1.0, and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. The proportion of viral load suppression was determined. A binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with viral load suppression. Statistical significance was declared at a 95% confidence interval (CI) with a P-value <0.05.Results This study revealed that the proportion of viral load suppression among HIV-infected patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy was 73.8% (95% CI, 68.0–79.1). Those who missed the second-line antiretroviral regimen [AOR = 0.315, 95% CI (0.162–0.612)], a baseline viral load count of <10,000 copies/mm3 [AOR = 2.291, 95% CI (1.216-4.316)], and a baseline body mass index of ≥18.5 kg/m2 [AOR = 2.438, 95% CI (1.098–5.414)] were significantly associated with viral load suppression.Conclusions The proportion of patients with viral load suppression fell below the WHO’s and national level. Viral load suppression was significantly influenced by missed second-line antiretroviral doses, a baseline viral load count of <10,000 copies/ml, and a baseline body mass index of ≥18.5 kg/m2. Hence interventions targeting counseling to patients that missed their antiretroviral therapy, keeping patient’s viral load to be less than 10,000 copies/ml through adequate adherence counseling among second-line antiretroviral therapy were recommended."

The aim of this study was to collate exome sequencing data from multiple epithelial ovarian cancer case cohorts and controls in order to systematically evaluate the role of coding, loss-of-function variants across the genome in epithelial ovarian cancer risk. We assembled exome data for a total of 2,573 non-mucinous cases (1,876 high-grade serous and 697 non-high grade serous) and 13,925 controls. Harmonised variant calling and quality control filtering was applied across the different data sets. We carried out a gene-by-gene simple burden test for association of rare loss-of-function variants (minor allele frequency < 0.1%) with all non-mucinous ovarian cancer, high grade serous ovarian cancer and non-high grade serous ovarian cancer using logistic regression adjusted for the top four principal components to account for cryptic population structure and genetic ancestry. Seven of the top 10 associated genes were associations of the known ovarian cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D, MSH6 and PALB2 (false discovery probability < 0.1). A further four genes (HELB, OR2T35, NBN and MYO1A) had a false discovery rate of less than 0.1. Of these, HELB was most strongly associated with the non-high grade serous histotype (P = 1.3x10−6, FDR = 9.1x10−4). Further support for this association comes from the observation that loss of function variants in this gene are also associated with age at natural menopause and Mendelian randomisation analysis shows an association between genetically predicted age at natural menopause and endometrioid ovarian cancer, but not high-grade serous ovarian cancer."

In this study, we evaluated the use of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to images of electrocardiograms (ECGs) to predict HF risk.Methods Across multinational longitudinal cohorts in the integrated Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS) and in population-based UK Biobank (UKB) and Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), we identified individuals without HF at baseline. Incident HF was defined based on the first occurrence of an HF hospitalization. We evaluated an AI-ECG model that defines the cross-sectional probability of left ventricular dysfunction from a single image of a 12-lead ECG and its association with incident HF. We accounted for the competing risk of death using the Fine-Gray subdistribution model and evaluated the discrimination using Harrel’s c-statistic. The pooled cohort equations to prevent HF (PCP-HF) were used as a comparator for estimating incident HF risk.Results Among 231,285 individuals at YNHHS, 4472 had a primary HF hospitalization over 4.5 years (IQR 2.5-6.6) of follow-up. In UKB and ELSA-Brasil, among 42,741 and 13,454 people, 46 and 31 developed HF over a follow-up of 3.1 (2.1-4.5) and 4.2 (3.7-4.5) years, respectively. A positive AI-ECG screen portended a 4-fold higher risk of incident HF among YNHHS patients (age-, sex-adjusted HR [aHR] 3.88 [95% CI, 3.63-4.14]). In UKB and ELSA-Brasil, a positive-screen ECG portended 13- and 24-fold higher hazard of incident HF, respectively (aHR: UKBB, 12.85 [6.87-24.02]; ELSA-Brasil, 23.50 [11.09-49.81]). The association was consistent after accounting for comorbidities and the competing risk of death. Higher model output probabilities were progressively associated with a higher risk for HF. The model’s discrimination for incident HF was 0.718 in YNHHS, 0.769 in UKB, and 0.810 in ELSA-Brasil. Across cohorts, incorporating model probability with PCP-HF yielded a significant improvement in discrimination over PCP-HF alone.Conclusions An AI model applied to images of 12-lead ECGs can identify those at elevated risk of HF across multinational cohorts. As a digital biomarker of HF risk that requires just an ECG image, this AI-ECG approach can enable scalable and efficient screening for HF risk."

We aimed to evaluate the performance of the new Q Filariasis Antigen Test (QFAT) with the currently recommended Filariasis Test Strip (FTS) for detecting the Ag of Wuchereria bancrofti, the causative agent of LF, under field conditions.Methodology/Principal Findings During an LF survey in Samoa, 344 finger-prick blood samples were tested using FTS and QFAT. Microfilariae (Mf) status was determined from blood slides prepared from Ag-positive samples. Each test was re-read at 1 hour and the next day to determine the stability of results over time. Overall Ag-positivity by FTS was 29% and 30% by QFAT. Concordance between the two tests was 94% (Kappa=0.85). Of the 105 Mf slides available, 38.1% were Mf-positive, and all were Ag-positive by both tests. Darker test line intensities from Ag-positive FTS were found to predict Mf-positivity (compared to same/lighter line intensities). QFAT had significantly higher reported test result changes than FTS, mostly reported the next day. The field laboratory team preferred QFAT over FTS due to the smaller blood volume required, better usability, and easier readability.Conclusion/Significance QFAT could be a suitable and user-friendly diagnostic alternative for use in the monitoring and surveillance of LF in field surveys based on its similar performance to FTS under field conditions.Author Summary Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating tropical disease caused by an infection with parasitic filarial worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes. Long-term infection can lead to stigmatising chronic conditions like lymphoedema and elephantiasis. The World Health Organization initiated the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (GPELF) in 2000, which focuses on the mass administration of anti-LF drugs to stop transmission in endemic countries. However, to monitor the success of this programme and to make informed decisions to stop costly mass drug administrations, it is crucial to have access to accurate and reliable rapid diagnostics. Here, we evaluated the performance of a new rapid antigen test called the Q Filariasis antigen test and compared it to the currently recommended filariasis test strip under field conditions in Samoa. This study showed that the new rapid test could be a suitable alternative to the currently recommended test for use in GPELF-related activities with more user-friendly features."

Epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, may influence this intricate interplay, though the specifics remain poorly understood. Leveraging data from the subcohort of the Finnish Twin Cohort (n=173; 86 full twin pairs) that includes comprehensive measurements of obesity-related outcomes, mitochondrial DNA quantity (mtDNAq) and nuclear DNA methylation levels in adipose and muscle tissue, we identified one locus at SH3BP4 (cg19998400) significantly associated with mtDNAq in adipose tissue (FDR<0.05). SH3BP4 methylation correlated with its gene expression. Additionally, 14 out of the 35 obesity-related traits displayed significant associations with both SH3BP4 methylation and mtDNAq in adipose tissue. Using the method that infers causality from examination of familial confounding (ICE FALCON) our data suggests that mtDNAq, insulin sensitivity and certain body fat measures are causal to SH3BP4 methylation. The examination of mtDNAq and obesity-related traits suggested causation from mtDNAq to obesity which could not, however, be distinguished from potential unmeasured within-individual confounding. In conclusion, our findings underscore the impact of mtDNAq on DNA methylation and expression of the SH3BP4 gene within adipose tissue, with potential implications for obesity."

Despite a growing body of research underscoring the potential benefits of music therapy and music medicine in enhancing infant development and aiding medical practices, the specific characteristics of music that maximize these benefits remain poorly understood. This systematic review aims to fill this gap by investigating the effects of passive music listening on the development and medical outcomes of infants, both full-term and premature. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted, covering studies published up until December 2022. The focus was on passive music listening, with a deliberate exclusion of active music interventions. Out of the initial pool of studies, 56 met the inclusion criteria, determined by the PICO framework, focusing on passive music exposure among full-term and preterm infants. Starting with a descriptive analysis approach, the study employed Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify key themes, including the physiological impacts of music, its role in pain management, effects on sleep and stress, and influences on feeding and weight gain. The review revealed a predominance of quantitative research methods, a significant concentration of studies from the United States, suggesting potential geographical bias, and a notable clinical setting bias. These findings indicate a critical need for methodological diversity and a more culturally inclusive and interdisciplinary approach to research. Although this systematic review highlights the beneficial role of passive music listening in pediatric care, it also points to the necessity for standardized music intervention protocols to optimize therapeutic and developmental outcomes for this vulnerable population. Future research should aim to bridge the methodological gaps identified, integrating both qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of music’s impact on infant development and medical practices in a global, culturally nuanced context."

Previous studies indicate that stroke typically affects the processes underlying motor control and execution but not the learning of those skills. However, these prior studies could have been confounded by the presence of significant motor impairments and/or have not focused on motor acuity tasks (i.e., tasks focusing on the quality of executed actions) that have direct functional relevance to rehabilitation.Methods Twenty-five participants (10 stroke; 15 controls) were recruited for this prospective, case-control study. Participants learned a novel foot-trajectory tracking task on two consecutive days while walking on a treadmill. On day 1, participants learned a new gait pattern by performing a task that necessitated greater hip and knee flexion during the swing phase of the gait. On day 2, participants repeated the task with their training leg to test retention. An average tracking error was computed to determine online and offline learning and was compared between stroke survivors and uninjured controls.Results Stroke survivors were able to improve their tracking performance on the first day (p=0.033); however, the amount of learning in stroke survivors was lower in comparison with the control group on both days (p≤0.05). Interestingly, the offline gains in motor learning were higher in stroke survivors when compared with uninjured controls (p=0.011).Conclusions The results suggest that even high-functioning stroke survivors may have difficulty acquiring new motor skills related to walking, which may be related to the underlying neural damage caused at the time of stroke. Furthermore, it is likely that stroke survivors may require longer training with adequate rest to acquire new motor skills, and rehabilitation programs should target motor skill learning to improve outcomes after stroke."

It remains unclear whether these associations share a common genetic architecture. To address this gap, by leveraging summary-level genetic data from the UK Biobank of hypothyroidism and the FinnGen study of three complex diseases (sarcoidosis, chronic sinusitis, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) endpoints), we evaluated their shared genetic etiology. A significant genetic correlation was found between hypothyroidism and the three diseases. Cross-trait analyses utilizing the MTAG and CPASSOC models revealed 12, 2, and 12 shared loci between hypothyroidism and chronic sinusitis, ILD endpoints, and sarcoidosis, respectively. The SNP heritability enrichment analysis across 37 tissues and 136 cell types at the single-cell level identified candidate tissues and cell types that were shared by the diseases. Interestingly, we found a positive genetic relationship between these four diseases and central memory CD4+ T cells in the blood, supported by strong colocalization evidence (posterior probability >0.9). Mendelian randomization and colocalization analysis showed a link between hypothyroidism and sarcoidosis with two genes (DOCK6 and CD226) in the blood. Furthermore, among the hypothyroidism-driven plasma proteins, RIPK2 was identified as a potentially actionable mediator of hypothyroidism’s effect on ILD endpoints. Overall, our findings contribute to improving our understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases’ intricate relationships, as well as providing insights toward disease prevention and comorbidity management."

Assuming the use case of self-triage, we used representative design principles to sample case vignettes from online platforms where patients describe their symptoms to obtain professional advice and compared triage performance of laypeople, SAAs, and Large Language Models (LLMs) on representative versus standard vignettes. We found performance differences in all three groups depending on vignette type (OR = 1.27 to 3.41, p < .001 to .035) and changed rankings of best-performing SAAs and LLMs. Based on these results, we argue that our representative vignette sampling approach (that we call the RepVig Framework) should replace the practice of using a fixed vignette set as standard for SAA evaluation studies."

However, the involvement of the gut microbiome in alcohol consumption of individuals with AUD undergoing treatment remains unclear. To address this, stool samples (n=48) were collected at screening (baseline) and trial completion from a single site of a multi-site double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Zonisamide in individuals with AUD. Alcohol consumption, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and phosphatidylethanol (PEth)levels were measured both at baseline and endpoint of 16-week trial period. Fecal microbiome was analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolome via untargeted LC-MS. Both sex (p = 0.003) and psychotropic medication usage (p = 0.025) are associated with baseline microbiome composition. The relative abundance of 12 genera at baseline was correlated with percent drinking reduction, baseline and endpoint alcohol consumption, and changes in GGT and PeTH over the course of treatment (p.adj < 0.05). Overall microbiome community structure at baseline differed between high and low responders (67-100% and 0-33% drinking reduction, respectively; p = 0.03). A positive relationship between baseline fecal GABA levels and percent drinking reduction (R=0.43, p < 0.05) was identified by microbiome function prediction and confirmed by ELISA and metabolomics. Predicted microbiome function and metabolomics analysis have found that tryptophan metabolic pathways are over-represented in low responders. These findings highlight importance of baseline microbiome and metabolites in alcohol consumption in AUD patients undergoing zonisamide treatment."

We compared the results of a single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin test (SICCTT) with cytokine profiles before and after anti-helminthic treatment in cattle in their natural environment. Cattle were initially subjected to SICCTT and their helminth status assessed by coprological testing for Strongyle-type, Strongyloides sp., Toxocara vitulorum, Nematodirus sp., Paraphistomum cervi, Fasciola gigantica, Dicrocoelium dendriticum and Moniezia benedeni.; 60 days after, they were dewormed and the SICCTT was repeated with coprological testing; SICCTT-positives underwent post mortem examination and mycobacterial culture to confirm TB infection. Also, we measured the level of circulating type 1 (gamma interferon [IFN-γ]), type 2 (interleukine-4 [IL-4]) and regulatory (transforming growth factor-beta [TGF-β]) cytokines before and after anthelminthic therapy. Results revealed that cattle positive by SICCTT showed typical granulomatous lesions suggestive of TB which was confirmed by positive culture. The proportion of SICCTT positive cattle increased to about two folds following anthelminthic treatment. Cattle co-infected with helminth-bTB have significantly (p = 0.000) lower levels of IFN-γ and higher levels of IL-4 and TGF-β. Conversely, anthelminthic therapy led to significantly (p=0.000) elevated levels of IFN-γ, concomitant (p =0.000) decreased levels of IL-4 and TGF-β. Overall, we show that anthelminthic treatment can improve the rate of SICCTT positivity and reverse the modulation of cytokine responses in helminth-bTB co-infection."

The investigation sought to uncover influential determinants to enhance the precision of prognostic assessments and inform targeted interventions for individuals affected by strokes.Methods Employing a longitudinal study design, participants were observed for 12 months from baseline, censoring survivors at the endpoint. The dataset originated from a comprehensive study involving stroke patients treated at three referral hospitals in Zimbabwe: Parirenyatwa, Sally Mugabe, and Chitungwiza Central Hospital. The primary outcome variable, the duration of survival until death, was measured in days from the initiation of stroke treatment. Gompertz parametric regression analysis was utilized for data modeling following Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model diagnostics.Results In our study, 188 stroke patients were enrolled at baseline. However, 51 patients were excluded from the analysis due to either missing information or loss to follow-up. Among the remaining 137 patients who were tracked over a 12-month period, 42% were censored, and 58% were deceased. Individuals utilizing ’Free Service (older than 65/pensioners/retirees)’ hospital bill payment methods showed a decreased risk of death (HR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.80), suggesting a protective effect compared to cash paying patients. Those with a secondary school level education displayed a significantly lower risk of death (HR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.69) compared to those without formal education. Age was a significant factor, with individuals aged 45-65 and those over 65 years showing higher adjusted hazard ratios (HR: 4.9, 95% CI: 1.80, 13.25; HR: 5.5, 95% CI: 1.92, 15.95, respectively) relative to those below 45 years of age. Housing status revealed a protective effect for those residing with parents/relatives (adjusted HR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.66), while individuals with a ’Very severe’ functional outcome showed an increased hazard (adjusted HR: 4.9, 95% CI: 1.12, 21.33).Conclusion The study findings demonstrate that hospital bill payment methods, housing status, educational attainment, functional outcome, and age significantly affect survival outcomes among stroke patients. This highlights the need to consider socio-demographic and clinical variables in the development of prognostic assessments and targeted interventions for individuals recovering from stroke."

Our prior work has challenged this assumption: by sampling TB clinic attendees, we detected equivalent release of Mtb-containing bioaerosols by confirmed TB patients and individuals not receiving a TB diagnosis, and we demonstrated a time-dependent reduction in Mtb bioaerosol positivity during six-months’ follow-up, irrespective of anti-TB chemotherapy. Now, by extending bioaerosol sampling to a randomly selected community cohort, we show that Mtb release is common in a TB-endemic setting: of 89 participants, 79.8% (71/89) produced Mtb bioaerosols independently of QuantiFERON-TB Gold status, a standard test for Mtb infection; moreover, during two-months’ longitudinal sampling, only 2% (1/50) were serially Mtb bioaerosol negative. These results necessitate a reframing of the prevailing paradigm of Mtb transmission and infection, and may explain the current inability to elucidate Mtb transmission networks in TB-endemic regions.Summary Elucidating chains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission is limited by a dependence on linking sputum-positive tuberculosis cases. Here, we report persistent M. tuberculosis bioaerosol release in the majority of a randomly selected community cohort. The contribution to tuberculosis transmission is unknown."

Yet, data on the impact of these events on control programs remain rare. Using unique data from Madagascar, we estimate high rates of infection in the wake of two major tropical cyclones. Evidence that infection rebounds rapidly during gaps in interventions indicates maintaining continuity of coverage is crucial to limiting burden. Relative to other interventions, recently available malaria vaccines have a longer duration of protection, with the potential to address interruptions in prevention deployment. Evaluating this use case, we quantify the reduction in symptomatic infections expected for a range of vaccination scenarios. We find long-lasting interventions such as vaccination are a key mitigation measure against climatic disruptions to disease control."

Screening and referral interventions for unmet social needs in healthcare settings have shown promising results. Most screening and referral interventions are implemented in primary care, despite evidence that disadvantaged populations face substantial barriers to accessing such care. There are few social care interventions in hospital settings. To address this gap, we designed a hospital-based intervention screening an outpatient population for unmet social needs and using a Health Navigator to provide referrals and follow-up to appropriate community and government resources. Here we present a protocol for a feasibility and acceptability study of a hospital-based Health Navigator intervention.Methods and Analysis We will conduct a single-centre study to explore the feasibility and acceptability of screening and referral for unmet social needs for patients attending an outpatient cancer clinic at a major metropolitan hospital serving a disadvantaged population in South Australia. Eligible participants are 18 years of age or older receiving treatment at the Northern Adelaide Cancer Centre, with an expected prognosis of minimum six months. Eligible participants will be asked to complete unmet social needs screening and baseline assessments. Participants with unmet social needs who request assistance will be connected with a Health Navigator (HN). The HN will work with participants to prioritise their needs and provide referrals to community and government services with follow-up of over six months from enrolment. Post-HN intervention, all participants will be asked to complete repeat unmet social needs screening and repeat assessments. The primary criteria for determining feasibility success are: 1) recruitment rates will be successful if 80% of eligible participants agree to unmet needs screening, 2) intervention uptake will be successful if 80% complete follow-up, 3) reasons for not completing intervention and 4) participant and clinician acceptability of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include changes to clinical measures such as coping capacity, quality of life and patient-reported experience measures. Thematic analysis will be applied to focus groups with clinicians and participants to assess intervention acceptability. Secondary clinical outcomes will be reported as effect size estimates for future trial. As feasibility studies are designed to test whether an intervention is appropriate for larger studies, rather than finding specific associations or outcomes, no sample size calculation is necessary. Study findings will be used to optimise recruitment and intervention components, and develop suitable outcome measures for larger, randomized studies.Ethics and Dissemination The protocol has ethical approval from the Central Adelaide Local Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee (approval ID: 16448).Trial registration: ACTRN12622000802707pProtocol date and version: 07 June 2022, V1Strengths and limitations of this studyMost screening and referral interventions for unmet social needs occur in primary care, despite disadvantaged populations facing significant barriers to accessing primary care. This study takes place in a hospital setting.There are few interventions for unmet social needs in Australia. This study is a valuable contribution to screening and referral research in Australia.This study employs a screening tool for unmet needs co-designed with clinicians and community, and is one of few validated screening tools for unmet needs.The study population is limited to people living with cancer who experience substantial healthcare needs and treatment adverse effects. Findings are unlikely to be representative of the general population."

Conventional diagnosis of anthrax involves microscopy, culture identification of bacterial colonies and molecular detection. Genetic markers used are often virulence gene targets such as Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (pagA, as also called BAPA, occurring on plasmid pXO1), lethal factor (lef, on pXO1), as well as chromosomal (Ba-1) and plasmid (capsule-encoding capB/C, located on pXO2). Combinations of genetic markers using real-time/quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) are used to confirm B. anthracis from culture but can also be used directly on diagnostic samples to avoid propagation and its associated biorisks and for faster identification. We investigated how the presence of closely related species could complicate anthrax diagnoses with and without culture to standardise the use of genetic markers using qPCR for accurate anthrax diagnosis. Using blood smears from 2012-2020 from wildlife mortalities (n=1708) in Kruger National Park in South Africa where anthrax is endemic, we contrasted anthrax diagnostic results based on qPCR, microscopy, and culture. From smears, 113/1708 grew bacteria in culture, from which 506 isolates were obtained. Of these isolates, only 24.7% (125 isolates) were positive for B. anthracis based on genetic markers or microscopy. However, among these, merely 4/125 (3.2%) were confirmed B. anthracis isolates (based on morphology, microscopy, and sensitivity testing to penicillin and gamma-phage) from the blood smear, likely due to poor survival of spores on stored smears. This study identified B. cereus sensu lato, which included B. cereus and B. anthracis, Peribacillus spp., and Priestia spp. clusters using gyrB gene in selected bacterial isolates positive for BAPA. Using qPCR on blood smears, 52.1% (890 samples) tested positive for B. anthracis based on one or a combination of genetic markers which included the 25 positive controls. Notably, the standard lef primer set displayed the lowest specificity and accuracy. Interestingly, various marker combinations, such as Ba-1+capB, BAPA+capB, Ba-1+BAPA+capB+lef, and BAPA+lef+capB, all demonstrated 100.0% specificity and 98.7% accuracy, while maintaining a sensitivity of 96.6%. The BAPA+lef+Ba-1 combination showed 100% specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy. Using Ba-1+BAPA+lef+capB, as well as Ba-1+BAPA+lef with molecular diagnosis accurately detects B. anthracis in the absence of bacterial culture. Systematically combining microscopy and molecular markers holds promise for notably reducing false positives, thereby significantly enhancing the detection and surveillance of diseases like anthrax in southern Africa and beyond and reducing the need for propagation of the bacteria in culture."

Review manager (RevMan) was used to perform meta-analyses using a random-effect model. Dichotomous outcomes were pooled using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results Our meta-analysis included 6 RCTs with a total of 1665 patients. Most studies included patients with an ASPECTS score of 3-5. Our results demonstrate that endovascular thrombectomy significantly increased the rates of functional independence (mRS ≤ 2) (RR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.89-3.29) and moderate neurological outcome (mRS ≤ 3) (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.50-2.40) at 90 days. The benefit of EVT for these outcomes remained the same at 1-year follow-up.. Endovascular thrombectomy was associated with increased rates of early neurological improvement (RR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.53-3.22), excellent neurological recovery (mRS ≤ 1) (RR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.02-3.03), and decreased rate of poor neurological recovery (mRS 4-6) (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76-0.86). No significant difference was found between the two groups regarding all-cause mortality (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72-1.02), decompressive craniectomy (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.89-1.94), and the incidence of serious adverse effects (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.83-2.32) between the two groups. Endovascular thrombectomy significantly increased the rates of any intracranial hemorrhage (RR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.48-2.53) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.11-2.69).Conclusion Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) significantly improves neurological and functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke with a large infarct area (ASPECTS 3-5) compared to medical therapy alone, with an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage."

In this study, we employed an electrochemistry-based targeted metabolomics platform to assess the metabolic effects of three randomly-assigned treatments: escitalopram, duloxetine, and Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) in 163 treatment-naïve outpatients with major depressive disorder. Serum samples from baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment were analyzed using targeted liquid chromatography-electrochemistry for metabolites related to tryptophan, tyrosine metabolism and related pathways. Changes in metabolite concentrations related to each treatment arm were identified and compared to define metabolic signatures of exposure. In addition, association between metabolites and depressive symptom severity (assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD17]) and anxiety symptom severity (assessed with the 14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety [HRSA14]) were evaluated, both at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment.Significant reductions in serum serotonin level and increases in tryptophan-derived indoles that are gut bacterially derived were observed with escitalopram and duloxetine arms but not in CBT arm. These include indole-3-propionic acid (I3PA), indole-3-lactic acid (I3LA) and Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin. Purine-related metabolites were decreased across all arms. Different metabolites correlated with improved symptoms in the different treatment arms revealing potentially different mechanisms between response to antidepressant medications and to CBT."

This study harnesses the innovative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) through the aiHumanoid platform to simulate AD progression. In this study, we focus on the impact of two APOE genotypes on disease development and progression. Our longitudinal virtual subject simulations, grounded in extensive medical literature and genetic information, explore the nuanced interplay between specific genetic variants, APOE ε3/4 and ε4/4, and their role in AD’s heterogeneity. Despite the potential limitations associated with emerging technologies, including the translatability of AI simulations to real-world scenarios and the scope of genetic variants, this research provides key insights into early biomarkers and the progression patterns of AD. Future segments of this study (Part 2 and Part 3) will broaden the analysis to encompass a wider array of genetic factors and their interactions, enhancing the understanding of AD and paving the way for personalized intervention strategies. Ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in medical research are acknowledged, emphasizing the need for responsible integration of technology in healthcare. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of AI in advancing AD research, offering a foundation for future studies aimed at refining diagnostic and therapeutic approaches through enhanced realism in simulations and a comprehensive exploration of genetic and environmental factors."

Lebanon is a small country that hosts the largest number of refugees per capita in the world. With exacerbating socioeconomic conditions, exclusionary policies against refugees, and a fragmented humanitarian system, the status of older Syrian refugees (OSRs) requires special attention. This study aimed to explore OSRs’ unmet needs, coping strategies, available humanitarian services, and some indicators of the humanitarian inclusion standards focusing on the shelter, health, nutrition and food security, and water, sanitation and hygiene sectors. We conducted a convergent mixed-methods study between December 2021 and March 2022 in the North and Bekaa, including a cross-sectional survey with 461 participants and 14 semi-structured interviews. Results show that OSRs lived in inappropriate shelters (cold, leaking rainwater), especially in informal tented settlements. High rent prices pushed refugee households with elderly to prioritize paying rent at the expense of other needs such as food and medication, particularly when food cash transfer is the sole source of income, jeopardizing food security and intake. Access to dignifying and accessible bathing facilities was compromised in ITSs with shared facilities. Substantial medical costs hindered OSRs access to healthcare such as surgeries. Due to the crisis, chronic medications are not always available in dispensaries for subsidized cost, pushing OSRs to non-compliance and selling food assistance to buy medications. Soaring fuel prices hindered OSRs access to heating and transportation to receive healthcare. No efforts were reported in collecting data on OSRs’ needs, targeting them with information on services, or soliciting feedback for programming, especially in the absence of any age-tailored interventions. Findings shed light on the precarious living conditions of OSRs in Lebanon and add to the body of evidence documenting their invisibility to the humanitarian response. An age-inclusive response is needed through holistic, tailored, and sustainable interventions."

Deep learning has been used to characterize and quantify the status of the CoW in various applications for the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease. In medical imaging, the performance of deep learning models is limited by the diversity and size of training datasets. To address medical data scarcity, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been applied to generate synthetic vessel neuroimaging data. However, the proposed methods produce synthetic data with limited anatomical fidelity or downstream utility in tasks concerning vessel characteristics.We adapted the StyleGANv2 architecture to 3D to synthesize Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (TOF MRA) volumes of the CoW. For generative modeling, we used 1782 individual TOF MRA scans from 6 open source datasets. To train the adapted 3D StyleGAN model with limited data we employed differentiable data augmentations and used mixed precision and a cropped region of interest of size 32×128×128 to tackle computational constraints. The performance was evaluated quantitatively using the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), MedicalNet distance (MD) and Area Under the Curve of the Precision and Recall Curve for Distributions (AUC-PRD). Qualitative analysis was performed via a visual Turing test. We demonstrated the utility of generated data in a downstream task of multiclass semantic segmentation of CoW arteries. Vessel segmentation performance was assessed quantitatively using the Dice coefficient and the Hausdorff distance.The best-performing 3D StyleGANv2 architecture generated high-quality and diverse synthetic TOF MRA volumes (FID: 12.17, MD: 0.00078, AUC-PRD: 0.9610). Multiclass vessel segmentation models trained on synthetic data alone achieved comparable performance to models trained using real data in most arteries.In conclusion, generative modeling of the Circle of Willis via synthesis of 3D TOF MRA data paves the way for generalizable deep learning applications in cerebrovascular disease. In the future, the extensions of the provided methodology to other medical imaging problems or modalities with the inclusion of pathological datasets has the potential to advance the development of more robust models for clinical applications."

We measure the presence of glyphosate in the human body, in order to create, together with the local community, a systemic model that highlights modifiable causal socio-environmental conditions.Materials and methods Participatory Action Research. Measurement of environmental factors and self-reported oncological disease were obtained in a three-stage probabilistic sampling (blocks, houses, family) of people living in French city - 9 de Julio-Buenos Aires. Glyphosate in urine was analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The exposure pathway was obtained by interviewing positive cases. A conceptual systemic model was designed.Results of the total 46 blocks of French, 23 were included with systematic sampling and from the 76 houses selected (50%) one person was included in the study. Oncological disease was reported in 21.8% of the households. 13% of the population (95% CI 6.5-23) presented quantifiable glyphosate in urine in June 2023. Occupational exposure was ruled out in all cases. The main self-reported sources were: unloading agrochemicals in the nearby warehouse, the grain storage complex, pesticide drift and self-propelled sprayers that pass by on the street, variables belonging to economic and cultural conditions. A network of actors emerged who, gathered on a website, propose actions to the mayor’s office.Discussion This study has high external validity for public health decision makers regarding the determinants. It is necessary to notify the Argentine Integrated Health System, both suspected exposure and possibly related health events, and to design how to refer human samples to highly complex laboratories to measure pesticides.Conclusion the presence of glyphosate in urine was due to environmental exposure; It expresses a path of passive, involuntary and chronic absorption of environmental pollutants and is due to French’s agricultural activity with dominance of market forces in the system, poorly antagonized by care forces."

In 2010, the Ministry of Health declared a policy that persons who were locked (pasung) should be unlocked or freed (bebas) from confinement and provided mental health services. This study is an empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of one Bebas Pasung program in Indonesia at two-year follow-up.Methods From medical records in Soerojo Mental Hospital, Magelang, Central Java, 114 persons with severe mental illness who had been unlocked, treated, and returned to the community from four districts served by the hospital were identified. At two-year follow-up, 62 caregivers were able to be contacted and willing to participate in a study. Data were collected from hospital records about condition of the patient at time of ‘unlocking’ and at discharge, and primary caregivers were interviewed about the previous locking and care of the patient since return, as well as experiences of caregiving.Results We provide descriptive data concerning history of illness, reasons for locking, type of confinement, and care of the individual since return. 58% of those unlocked were men, 80% had diagnoses of schizophrenia, and mean age was 35. At follow-up, 24% of this sample had been re-locked; only 44% took medications regularly, including 33% of those re-locked and 47% of those not relocked. A majority cared for themselves, half were partially or fully productive, and the quality of life of family caregivers improved significantly since their family member was unlocked, treated, and returned home.Conclusions This program successfully unlocked, treated, and returned to their homes persons with severe mental illness living in pasung or restraints. Findings suggest such unlocking programs need to be linked more closely to community-based mental health and rehabilitation services, maintain care of the patient, and provide a path toward recovery."

Traditional spiritual healers (TSHs) are grouped into three categories. One category of Baganda TSHs, Balubaale, engage ancestral spirits during health management. Balubaale are socially significant but not legally accepted. Their initiation and training practices have not been documented in Uganda. The study purpose was to understand and establish the training of traditional spiritual healers. Twelve (10M, 2F); practicing TSHs in Central Uganda were purposively selected and recruited between 15th July 2019 and 29th April 2020, and were prospectively interacted with for 24 months. Transcribed data was coded and thematically analyzed using ATLAS ti. 22 computer software and presented based on an inductive approach. Findings show key areas of TSHs training include connecting with ancestral spirits and the spiritual powers of non-materials and materials such as living and non-living things through rituals. Spiritual healers train in diagnosis and health management based on ancestral spirits and they finally pass out in a communal ceremony witnessed by family and community members. We conclude that TSHs undergo training and are supervised and supported by experienced spiritualists, family and the community. We recommend similar studies among other ethnic groups to contextualize the process of becoming a TSH, compare and harmonize findings to facilitate inter-medical systems communication and policy considerations."

Estonian Experience,"AbstractAntibiotic resistance refers to the ability of microbes to grow in the presence of an antibiotic that would have originally killed or inhibited the growth of these microorganisms. Microorganisms resistant to antibiotics exist in humans, animals and in the environment. Resistant microbes can spread from animals to humans and vice versa either through direct contact or through the environment. Resistant bacteria survive in the body during a course of antibiotics and continue to multiply. Treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections takes more time, costs more, and sometimes may prove impossible.The aim of the AMR-RITA project was to develop recommendations based on scientific evidence including the “One Health” principle for the formulation of policy on antibiotic resistance. In order to achieve the goal, the role of human behaviour, human and animal medicine, and the environment was implicated in the development of antibiotic resistance. The evaluation of the resistance spread routes, risks and levels, and the possible measures to control the spread of antibiotic resistance were identified.Topics related to antibiotic resistance were analysed in medicine, veterinary medicine and environment subsections. Existing data were combined with new data to assess the transmission routes and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. For this purpose, samples were collected from people, animals, food, and the environment. The analysis of the samples focused on the main resistent organisms, resistance genes and antibiotic residues.As a result of the study, we conclude that the use of antibiotics in Estonia is generally low compared to other European countries. However, there are bottlenecks that concern both human and veterinary medicine. In both cases, we admit that for some diagnoses there were no treatment guidelines and antibiotics were used for the wrong indications. The lack of specialists of clinical microbiology is a problem in Estonain hospitals. For example, many hospitals lack an infection control specialist. The major worrying trends are the unwarranted use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in humans and the high use of antibiotics critical for human medicine (cephalosporins, quinolones) in the teratment of animals.If more antibiotics are being used, resistance will also spread. We found that those cattle farms that use more cephalosporins also have higher levels of resistance (ESBL-mediated resistance). It also turned out that genetically close clusters of bacteria are often shared by humans and animals. This is evidence of a transfer of resistance between species. However, such transfer occurs slowly, and we did not detect any transfer events in the recent years.Antibiotic residues, just like other drug residues, can reach the environment. The use of slurry and composted sewage sludge as fertilizer are the main pathways. We detected fluroquinolones and tetracyclines in comparable concentrations in slurry and uncomposted sewage sludge. Composting reduces the content of drug residues, and the efficiency of the process depends on the technology used. In addition to antibiotic residues, we also determined some other drug residues accumulating in the environment. High levels of diclofenac and carbamazepine in surface water are a special concern. These are medicines for human use only, so they reach the environment through sewage treatment plants.Based on the results obtained during the research, we propose a series of evidence-based recommendations to the state for the formulation of antimicrobial resistance policy. We propose that Estonia needs sustainable AMR surveillance institution, which (1) continuously collects and analyses data on the use of antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance and provides regular feedback to relevant institutions (state, health and research institutions), (2) assesses the reliability of the data and ensures carrying out additional and confirming studies, (3) coordinates the activities of national and international research and monitoring networks and projects. We recommend creation of a competence centre that would deal with the topic of AMR across all fields. This should also include funding for research."

Predicting osteoporotic fracture risk is both clinically-beneficial and cost-effective. However, traditional tools using clinical factors and bone mineral density (BMD) fail to reflect bone microstructure. Here we aim to use high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) images to construct deep-learning models which predict fragility fracture history in elderly Chinese women.Methods We used ChiVOS, a community-based national cohort of 2,664 Chinese elderly women. Demographic data, BMD, and HR-pQCT from 216 patients were used to construct three groups of models: BMD, pQCT-index, and DeepQCT. For DeepQCT, we used ResNet34 as classifier, and logistic regression for late fusion. Models were developed using 6-fold cross-validation in development set (90%, N=195), and tested in internal test set (10%, N=21). We applied unsupervised clustering on HR-pQCT indices to derive patient subgroups.Findings DeepQCT (best model AUC 0.86-0.94) was superior or similar to pQCT-index (best model AUC 0.8-0.93), which both outperformed BMD (best model AUC 0.54-0.78). Surprisingly, DeepQCT built from non-weight-bearing bones performed similarly to weight-bearing bones. Furthermore, two distinct patient groups were classified using HR-pQCT indices. The one with higher DeepQCT risk score showed lower volumetric BMD, bone more microarchitectural abnormalities, and had higher probability of osteoporosis and fragility fracture history.Interpretation DeepQCT scores and HR-pQCT-index permit early recognition of patients with high risk of fragility fracture. This established framework can be easily adapted for other diagnostic tasks using HR-pQCT scans, which promotes bone health management via digital medicine.Funding This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (LC, 82100946; WX, 82270938), CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (WX, 2021-I2M-1-002), National Key R&D Program of China (WX, 2021YFC2501700), National High Level Hospital Clinical Research Funding (WX, 2022-PUMCH-D-006), the Non-profit Central Research Institute Fund of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (LC, 2023-PT320-10), and Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by BAST (LC, No.BYESS2023171). Part of the study was supported by Merck Sharp & Dohme China, Hangzhou, China.Evidence before this study Bone mineral density (BMD) from dual X-ray absorptiometry was firstly used to predict fragility fracture, but had low sensitivity. Tools like FRAX, QFracture, and Garvan, which also incorporated clinical factors into prediction models, showed improved performance. Models containing standard HR-pQCT indices (μFRAC) further surpassed most clinical tools. Nevertheless, direct learning from original HR-pQCT images is always desired to reduce labor and bias. Deep learning being the most common method for image-based learning, we searched PubMed for articles published up to Mar 25, 2024, using keywords “(‘fragility fracture’ OR ‘osteoporotic fracture’) and (‘prediction model’) and (‘HR-pQCT’ or ‘High-resolution peripheral quantitative CT’) and (‘deep-learning’ OR ‘deep learning’)”. Results showed that no study has built deep learning models from HR-pQCT for fragility fracture prediction.Added value of this study We developed DeepQCT from HR-pQCT of 216 elderly Chinese women from a national cohort (ChiVOS), which calculated risk scores using individual bone images and clinical features. BMD and pQCT-index models were compared to DeepQCT. We found both DeepQCT (best model AUC 0.86-0.94) and pQCT-index (best model AUC 0.8-0.93) outperformed BMD (best model AUC 0.54-0.78). DeepQCT using non-weight-bearing bones (ulna, fibula) performed similarly to weight-bearing bones (tibia, radius). Specifically, HR-pQCT revealed one patient subgroup with higher DeepQCT risk scores, which showed lower BMD and multiple bone microarchitectural abnormalities, associated with osteoporosis and fragility fracture history.Implications of all the available evidence DeepQCT is the first method which uses deep-learning to predict fragility fracture directly from HR-pQCT images. It is also the first to use single bones individually in prediction models, including non-weight-bearing bones, which are excluded in HR-pQCT-index computation. Of note, DeepQCT risk score is highly clinically relevant, as showed in bone density or microarchitectural features differences between patient subgroups. The non-inferior performance of DeepQCT compared to the manual annotation-dependent pQCT-index, supported its application to reduce labor and enhance efficiency. Performance of non-weight-bearing bones also challenges traditional perception of using load-bearing bones only in predicting osteoporotic conditions. Most importantly, the DeepQCT framework can be easily adapted for other tasks using HR-pQCT scans, which greatly expands application of digital medicine in bone mineral disease diagnosis or management."

Variation in temperature and rainfall conditions affect the temporal onset of dengue transmission. However, there is a need to understand how climate-related patterns and disease transmission mechanisms vary by location, particularly for topographically complex landscapes. In this investigation, we used dengue cases from 1,120 municipalities and five regions across Colombia during 2008–2019, and analyzed associations with extreme climate covariates generated from fine-scale, daily-level meteorological data, accounting for varying landscape and socio-economic properties. Using Bayesian spatio-temporal hierarchical models, we determined that high-intensity warm spells (with positive temperature anomalies of 8–12°C above mean monthly conditions) resulted in an earlier onset of dengue transmission risk in high-elevation settlements compared to low- elevation settlements. Furthermore, the risk of dengue transmission after extremely dry conditions was greater and extended for a longer duration in highly urbanized municipalities compared to those with a low urban population. Our findings highlight that meteorological hazards affect disease transmission in urban settlements differently based on elevation and socio-economic conditions. Additionally, our analysis adds to increasing evidence of the vulnerability of mountainous urban communities to extreme weather and vector-borne diseases. Overall, we emphasize the need for monitoring and forecasting the occurrence and intensity of meteorological hazards and associations with emerging climate-sensitive disease threats."

Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether the latter impairments are mediated by these biological pathways.Aims The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between neurocognition, the aforementioned biomarkers, and psychotic symptoms.Methods We recruited 67 participants, namely 40 patients diagnosed with MA-substance use and 27 healthy controls, and assessed the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), symptoms of psychosis, excitation, and formal thought disorders, OS toxicity (computed as the sum of myeloperoxidase (MPO), oxidized high-density lipoprotein (HDL), oxidized low-DL, and malondialdehyde), antioxidant defenses (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, total antioxidant capacity, zinc, and HDL), increased advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and soluble AGE receptors.Results We were able to extract one validated latent vector from the Mini Mental State Examination score and the BACS tests results (including executive functions, verbal fluency, attention), labeled general cognitive decline (G-CoDe). We found that 76.1% of the variance in the G-CoDe was explained by increased OS toxicity, lowered antioxidant defenses, number of psychotic episodes, and MA dose. In patients with MA use, MPO was significantly associated with the G-CoDe.Conclusions The use of MA induces mild cognitive impairments through MA-induced activation of detrimental outcome pathways, including oxidative and AGE-RAGE stress, and suppression of protective outcome pathways (antioxidants). Increased OS, MPO, and AGE-RAGE stress are new drug targets to prevent neurocognitive deficits and psychosis due to MA use."

In such systems, early warning signals (EWS) occur in a critical transition period preceding a sudden shift (tipping point) in the system. EWS are statistical observations occurring due to a system’s declining ability to maintain homeostasis when approaching a tipping point. The aim was to identify critical transition periods preceding bipolar mood state changes.Methods Participants with a validated bipolar diagnosis were included to a one-year follow-up study, with repeated assessments of the participants’ mood. Motor activity was recorded continuously by a wrist-worn actigraph. Participants assessed to have relapsed during follow-up were analyzed. Recognized EWS features were extracted from the motor activity data and analyzed by an unsupervised change point detection algorithm, capable of processing multi-dimensional data and developed to identify when the statistical property of a time series changes.Results Of 49 participants, four depressive and four hypomanic/manic relapses among six individuals occurred, recording actigraphy for 23.8 ± 0.2 hours/day, for 39.8 ± 4.6 days. The algorithm detected change points in the time series and identified critical transition periods spanning 13.5 ± 7.2 days. For depressions 11.4 ± 1.8, and hypomania/mania 15.6 ± 10.2 days.Conclusion The change point detection algorithm seems capable of recognizing impending mood episodes in continuous flowing data streams. Hence, we present an innovative method for forecasting approaching relapses to improve the clinical management of bipolar disorder."

However, how these genes contribute to disease risk and onset through altered expression and RNA splicing is not well understood. Combining our new bioinformatic pipeline IsoLamp with nanopore long-read amplicon sequencing, we deeply profiled the RNA isoform repertoire of 31 high-confidence neuropsychiatric disorder risk genes in human brain. We show most risk genes are more complex than previously reported, identifying 363 novel isoforms and 28 novel exons, including isoforms which alter protein domains, and genes such as ATG13 and GATAD2A where most expression was from previously undiscovered isoforms. The greatest isoform diversity was present in the schizophrenia risk gene ITIH4. Mass spectrometry of brain protein isolates confirmed translation of a novel exon skipping event in ITIH4, suggesting a new regulatory mechanism for this gene in brain. Our results emphasize the widespread presence of previously undetected RNA and protein isoforms in brain and provide an effective approach to address this knowledge gap. Uncovering the isoform repertoire of neuropsychiatric risk genes will underpin future analyses of the functional impact these isoforms have on neuropsychiatric disorders, enabling the translation of genomic findings into a pathophysiological understanding of disease."

The activation of RIPK1 is extensively modulated by posttranslational modification, such as ubiquitination. RIPK1 overactivation mediates autoinflammatory diseases in humans. However, the role of RIPK1 ubiquitination in human autoinflammatory diseases has not been reported, and the mechanism mediating the interaction of cell death and autoinflammation is largely unknown. Here, we report two patients carrying compound heterozygous RIPK1 variants K377E/R390G with recurrent fevers, lymphadenopathy and skin rashes. Mechanistically, K377E and R390G mutations impaired ubiquitination of RIPK1, which suppresses the formation of TNFR1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) and NF-κB activation, resulting in the loss of CD8+ T cells mediated by RIPK1 activation-induced cell death in the patients. We reveal that the death of CD8+ T cells promotes the secretion of TNF and IFNγ to activate monocytes and macrophages, which triggers further production of proinflammatory cytokines to amplify autoinflammation. Disruption of the communication between T cells and monocytes/macrophages through pharmacologic blockade of TNF and IFNγ attenuated proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. Collectively, our results demonstrate a crucial role of RIPK1 ubiquitination in regulating CD8+ T cell death and restraining autoinflammation. Our study demonstrates the mechanism for a group of autoinflammatory diseases mediated by RIPK1 activation-induced cell death, and highlights an important role of CD8+ T cells in driving autoinflammation."

However, most of these studies have predominantly centered on people of European descent, leaving a substantial knowledge gap on the clinical implications of current pharmacogenomic evidence in multi-ancestry populations such as Africans. Thus, whether pharmacogenomic (PGx) genetic testing implemented in European populations would be valid for a population of African origin is unknown. The objective of this review was to appraise previous psychiatric pharmacogenomic studies in Africa and highlight challenges and opportunities to initiate PGx testing in the region. A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify studies published in the English language up to January 26, 2024. The primary outcomes were treatment response, remission, side effects, and drug metabolism in African psychiatric patients.The review included 42 pharmacogenomic studies that explored the genetic profiles of psychiatric patients in Africa. Despite the limited number of studies, our review found strong evidence of pharmacogenomic diversity within the African populations, emphasizing the importance of pharmacogenomic research in this population. A high degree of variability and differences in the frequencies of cytochrome P450 (CYPs) genotypes have been reported within the African population. It is estimated that 28% of North Africans and Ethiopians are ultrarapid metabolizers of several medications, mainly attributed to the increased activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme. This prevalence is significantly higher than that among Caucasians (10%), or Hispanics, Chinese, or Japanese populations (1%). Due to the defective CYP2C19*2 allele (at a frequency of 14%) and CYP2C19*3 allele (2% frequency), 5.2% of Ethiopians were identified as poor metabolizers of S-mephenytoin, a probe substrate used to assess the activity of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. In Tunisian patients with schizophrenia, genotyping the CYP1A2 gene and using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) improved the effectiveness and safety of clozapine. Among South African patients with schizophrenia, antipsychotic treatment response was associated with two gene variants (rs13025959 in the MYO7B gene with the ‘C’ allele and rs10380 in the MTRR gene with the ‘T’ allele).Overall, the review has identified evidence of pharmacogenomic diversity in African populations and recommended expanding pharmacogenomic studies while introducing PGx testing in this population. For the few characterized genes, Africans showed qualitative and quantitative differences in the profile of pharmacogenetic variants when compared to other ethnic groups. Limited research funding, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled human resources might be a challenge, but by building upon local successes and through collaborations with international partners, it is possible to establish pharmacogenomic biobanks and leverage global genetic resources to initiate personalized treatment approaches in Africa."

There is a paucity of literature on the description of health, illness, disease, and management approaches among traditional spiritual healers. This article examines perspectives on health, illness, disease and management approaches among Baganda traditional spiritual healers, the Balubaale, in central Uganda, who engage ancestral spirits in health care and management.The study used a qualitative study design in particular grounded theory. Unstructured, qualitative interviews and observation were used on 12 male and female purposively selected Balubaale in Central Uganda. Data was transcribed, coded and thematically analyzed using ATLAS ti. 22 Computer software based on an inductive approach.Findings show that the words and concepts describing health, illness, disease and management approaches are descriptive and contextualized to include the problem, the prospected root-causes, and therapeutic approaches involved. The words for illness “olumbe”, disease “obulwadde” and the management approaches such as divination (kulagula), ritual cleansing (kwambulula), amulets (ensiriba and yirizi), and scarification (kusandaga) have spiritual and social dimensions, contextual meanings and attachments.Further research is recommended among other tribes and larger sample size to compare findings and terminologies to facilitate communication and policy considerations."

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of different adult age cutoffs for RSV vaccination programs, with or without a focus on people with higher disease risk due to chronic medical conditions (CMCs).Methods We developed a static individual-based model of medically-attended RSV disease to evaluate the cost-utility of alternate age-, medical risk-, and age-plus medical risk-based vaccination policies. The model followed a multi-age cohort of 100,000 people aged 50 years and older over a three-year period. Vaccine characteristics were based on RSV vaccines authorized in Canada as of March 2024. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2023 Canadian dollars per quality-adjust life year (QALY) from the health system and societal perspectives, discounted at 1.5%.Results Although all vaccination strategies averted medically-attended RSV disease, strategies focused on adults with CMCs were more likely to be cost-effective than age-based strategies. A program focused on vaccinating adults aged 70 years and older with one or more CMCs was optimal for a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000 per QALY. Results were sensitive to assumptions about vaccine price, but approaches based on medical risk remained optimal compared to age-based strategies even when vaccine prices were low. Findings were robust to a range of alternate assumptions.Interpretation Based on available data, RSV vaccination programs in some groups of older Canadians with underlying medical conditions are expected to be cost-effective."

Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest HIV burden as well as the highest PrEP coverage globally. As long-acting formulations continue to become available, it is crucial to understand the product preferences of potential users.Objective To conduct a scoping review focused on the region of Sub-Saharan Africa to understand which PrEP products, especially long-acting formulations, different patients and demographic groups prefer as well as the factors that influence their preferences.Design We identified 34 publications published between 2014 and 2024 that assessed preferences regarding at least one long-acting PrEP product in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa.Results Participants preferred longer-acting products over oral pills when given the choice in almost all studies. On-demand PrEP was commonly preferred over daily dosing, and long-acting products were preferred over on-demand dosing. A majority of studies found injectables to be most commonly preferred compared to daily oral PrEP, implants, and rings. This preference was observed across a range of demographics including men and women, youth, men who have sex with men, and female sex workers. Duration, efficacy, and discretion were the three most important factors influencing participants’ choices.Conclusions Long-acting products, especially injectables, are acceptable for a wide range of individuals at risk of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa and tend to be preferred over daily oral pills. Participants expressed a diversity of values and opinions regarding preferences, emphasizing the benefit of providing multiple formulations to maximize coverage over heterogeneous populations.Strength and Limitations of this Study Some key populations, such as transgender women, were underrepresented in the literature. With most studies published before long-acting products became widely available, the hypothetical preferences of non-experienced users may differ from preferences in practice."

Currently known rates for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation after cardiac surgery are derived from non-contemporary studies. This study aimed to explore the incidence and indications for PPM implantation at 30 days and one year after different cardiac surgical procedures in a modern cohort.Methods All first-time coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or valvular surgery patients in Sweden 2006 - 2020 without previous PPM or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (n= 76,447) were included in this nationwide population-based study using data from four national registries. Patients undergoing heart transplantation and those who subsequently received an ICD were excluded.Results A PPM was implanted in 8.2% (n= 6,271) of the patients, 35% (n= 2,196) within the first 30 days and 46.3% (n= 2,647) at one year following surgery. The main indication of PPM implantation was atrioventricular block. Tricuspid valve surgery exhibited the highest cumulative incidence for PPM both at 30 days (6.8% (95% confidence interval 4.3 – 10.0)) and one year (8.8% (95% CI 6.0 – 12.0)) surpassing mitral valve surgery (30-day 5.3% (95% CI 4.7-6.0); one-year 6.5% (95% CI 5.8-7.3)), aortic valve surgery (30-day 4.8% (95% CI 4.5-5.1); one-year 6.0% (95% CI 5.6-6.3)) and CABG (30-day 0.74% (95% CI 0.66-0.83); one-year 1.3% (95% CI 1.2-1.35)). The incidence following combined operations (multiple valves and/or coronary surgery) was 6.5% (95% CI 6.0 – 6.9) and 8.1% (95% CI 7.7 – 8.6) at 30 days and one year respectively. Concomitant ablation surgery increased the risk even further (adjusted Hazard Ratio 9.20 (95% CI 7.96-10.64), p<0.001).Conclusions The need for PPM after cardiac surgery is common, primarily due to atrioventricular block. Tricuspid valve surgery is associated with the highest risk for PPM implantation amongst isolated procedures. Combined procedures and concomitant surgical ablation further increase that risk.What is new?Permanent pacemaker after cardiac surgery is not uncommon with atrioventricular blocking being the main indication.Tricuspid valve surgery had the highest cumulative incidence at 30 days and one year, exceeding other isolated procedures.Combined cardiac surgical procedures and concomitant ablation surgery increased the risk even further.What are the clinical implications?This information is valuable while informing individual patients awaiting cardiac surgery about potential post-operative complications.Recognizing patients at higher risk enables targeted postoperative care, including closer monitoring for signs of conduction disturbances.Studies investigating and identifying predictors of post-cardiac surgery bradyarrhythmias and subsequent need for permanent pacemakers are needed."

The MDP parameters were derived from a dataset comprising 52 HNC patients treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2007 and 2013. Optimal re-planning strategies were obtained when the permissible number of re-plannings throughout the treatment was limited to 1, 2, and 3.Main results The MDP (optimal) solution recommended re-planning when the difference between planned and actual NTCPs (ΔNTCP) was greater than or equal to 1%, 2%, 2%, and 4% at treatment fractions 10, 15, 20, and 25, respectively, exhibiting a temporally increasing pattern. The ΔNTCP thresholds remained constant across the number of re-planning allowances (1, 2, and 3). This result underscores the importance of re-planning for patients experiencing the slightest change in ΔNTCP at fraction 10.Significance In contrast to prior work that relies on a single re-planning allowance or predetermined time intervals using a one-size-fits-all approach, the MDP model proposed in this paper offers a personalized, resource-aware, and scalable decision-making tool; it identifies optimal dynamic re-planning schedules tailored to individual needs, guided by changes in NTCP."

Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and ankle brachial index (ABI) were used to diagnose glycemic control and peripheral arterial disease, respectively. Generalized poisson log linear regression model was used to calculate the crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, and a significance level of p < 0.05.Results 226 patients were included in the study, finding 23% (n=52) with good glycemic control, and 44.7% (n=101) with peripheral arterial disease. The adjusted model found statistically significant associations for glycemic control, age, and sedentary lifestyle with peripheral arterial disease. Compared with patients with good glycemic control, those with poor glycemic control had a 34% higher probability to present peripheral arterial disease (aPR: 1.34, 95%CI: 1.01-1.79, p=0.045).Conclusions The prevalence of good glycemic control in the population with diabetic foot is low. Poor glycemic control was found to be independently associated with the presence of peripheral arterial disease."

Such information would provide valuable insights into the prevention of cardiometabolic diseases since childhood. We therefore studied for the first time the effects of a long-term diet and physical activity (PA) intervention on serum metabolites in a general population of children.Methods We carried out an 8-year, nonrandomized, controlled trial in a population sample of 490 prepubertal children (257 girls, 233 boys) aged 6–9 years followed up until adolescence. We allocated the children to a combined diet and PA intervention group and a control group. We performed a non-targeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics analysis of fasting serum samples at baseline, two years, and eight years. We analyzed the intervention effects on serum metabolites using linear mixed-effects models adjusting for sex and age.Results The intervention had effects on 80 serum metabolites over two years, 17 of these metabolites being affected by the interevention until eight years. The intervention had effects on several fatty amides (such as palmitic amide, linoleamide, oleamide, elaidamide, capsiamide, myristamide, palmitoleamide, docosanamide, and erucamide), unsaturated fatty acids (such as 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, hydroxyoxohexadecanoic acid, and oxotetradecenoic acid), and acylcarnitines (such as octanoyl-L-carnitine, decatrienoylcarnitine, and valerylcarnitine) as well as many phospholipids and sterols over two years. Moreover, the intervention affected several gut-microbiota-derived metabolites (such as hydroxyferulic acid, hippuric acid, indolepropionic acid, pyrocatechol sulfate, 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-pentyl-2-furanpropanoic acid, p-cresol sulfate, indolelactic acid, and 3,4-dimethyl-5-pentyl-2-furanpropanoic acid), amino acids (such as methoxybenzenepropanoic acid, glutamic acid, taurine, and hydroxyisoleucine), and purine metabolites (such as guanosine, inosine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine) over two years.Conclusions The diet and PA intervention had long-term effects on numerous serum metabolites that could influence cardiometabolic health since childhood. The intervention effects were most pronounced on serum fatty amides, but the intervention also affected other potentially important serum lipids, including fatty acids, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and sterols, as well as serum gut-microbiota-derived metabolites, amino acids, and purine metabolites. These metabolites could be molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of long-term lifestyle interventions on cardiometabolic health since childhood.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01803776.

Aggregated data on the prevalence of CKD are needed in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to inform strategies for early diagnosis and management. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of CKD among YPLHIV in SSA.Methods We searched Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, African Index Medicus, and African Journals Online for articles reporting the prevalence of CKD among YPLHIV in SSA using predefined search strategies up to 15th January 2024. The reference lists of identified articles were checked for additional eligible studies. The eligibility criteria were studies among YPHLIV aged 10-24 years reporting CKD prevalence defined by either glomerular filtration rate (GFR), albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or proteinuria. We used a narrative synthesis to report differences between the included studies. The DerSimonian-Liard random effects model was used to pool the CKD prevalence, and heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q-test and I-squared values. We assessed the risk of bias in each article using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist and publication bias in a funnel plot and Egger’s test.Results Of 802 retrieved articles, 16 fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Of these, 13 (86.7%) were cross-sectional studies that used estimated GFR to diagnose CKD. Only two studies followed the standard definition of CKD. The pooled CKD prevalence was 12.1% (95% CI 6.5-19.2%), ranging from 0.8% to 53.1% according to the definition used, with a high degree of heterogeneity (I2=97.5%, p<0.001). The included studies were of moderate quality, with no evidence of publication bias. Sensitivity analysis showed that the findings were robust to the methodological and analytic approach.Conclusion CKD prevalence among YPLHIV is moderately high and highly heterogeneous across SSA. The standard definition of CKD should be used to enable estimation of CKD prevalence in different studies and settings. HIV programs enrolling YPLHIV should routinely screen for CKD to ensure early diagnosis and management.PROSPERO registration number CRD42022347588."

Usually, in ER or OPD, clinical scores such as Alvarado Score, Ripasa scoring, and Tzanakis Scoring to diagnose Acute appendicitis. All these scores have different overlapping parameters and variable amounts of weightage. It is important to understand how sensitive and specific these scores are to determine the most accurate score to accurately diagnose acute appendicitis.Objectives Determine the Diagnostic accuracy of Alvarado Scoring, Ripasa Scoring, and Tzanakis Scoring compared to the Gold Standard Histopathology report.Methodology A Retrospective observational design was formulated where data of patients coming to the ER and OPD of the affiliated tertiary care hospital with right iliac fossa pain were enrolled. From the data, all clinical scores were calculated as per the standard guideline and the results of the scores were correlated with the gold standard Intraoperative Surgeon’s opinion and the patient’s histopathological report to determine the sensitivity, specificity, Youden Index and Accuracy of all the scores. Statistical software like EXCEL and SPSS along with Medcalc was used to produce the ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) & AUC of ROC and Fagan’s Nomogram.Results A total of 237 patients were enrolled who presented with right iliac fossa pain of which 156 were confirmed from the Histopathology report as patients with Acute Appendicitis. The Sensitivity was calculated for Alvarado (0.487), Ripasa (0.641), and Tzanakis(0.8269) whereas the Calculated Specificity was for Alvarado(0.8148), Ripasa(0.8395), Tzanakis(0.9699). The Younden Index was highest for Tzanakis score at 0.7968.Conclusion The Tzanakis Score is the most accurate Scoring method to diagnose Acute Appendicitis in patients presenting with RIF pain as it includes Ultrasonography. When USG is not available, the Ripasa score is the best scoring method while we do not recommend the use of Alvarado scoring due to poor sensitivity."

The real-life treatment trajectories can be complex, and one has to simplify the patterns to draw any conclusions; however, oversimplification will cause the loss of essential details. Thus, the visualization challenge is to strike a balance between the two extremes.Methods We have implemented the observation of treatment trajectories starting from cohort definitions in cooperation with medical specialists, data processing, and then generating the interactive visualizations and detailed data tables within an open-source R package as a Shiny dashboard. The created R package called TrajectoryViz (https://github.com/HealthInformaticsUT/TrajectoryViz) enables reproducible visual analysis and visual content generation for various data investigations.Results We illustrate the use of the tool by assessing the sequence of events present within the data of cervical cancer prevention pathways, as well as the proportions of timely follow-up procedure events.Conclusion Building a toolset to access, manage, and analyze observational health data enables more accessible visual analysis of complicated data, adding time dimension to otherwise simplified event sequences that make up trajectories."

Here we present an innovative multi-contrast laminar functional MRI technique that offers comprehensive and quantitative imaging of neurovascular (CBF, CBV, BOLD) and metabolic (CMRO2) responses across cortical layers at 7 Tesla. This technique was first validated through a finger-tapping experiment, revealing ‘double-peak’ laminar activation patterns within the primary motor cortex. By employing a ring-shaped visual stimulus that elicited positive and negative BOLD responses, we further observed distinct neurovascular and metabolic responses across cortical layers and eccentricities in the primary visual cortex. This not only indicates feedback inhibition of neuronal activities in both superficial and deep cortical layers underlying the negative BOLD signals in the fovea, but also illustrates the neuronal activities in visual areas adjacent to the activated eccentricities."

The former was particularly enriched in bacterial infection and phagocytosis, while the latter was enriched in genes related to antigen presentation and T cell proliferation and maturation. Genes with the 158 increased and 211 decreased IRs (termed IncIR and DecIR genes, respectively) in the depressed subjects were analysed. Their GO terms were very similar to those of the up- and down-regulated genes, with an emphasis on ciliary assembly and function in the DecIR. The results also showed that a Japanese herbal medicine partially reversed the depression in these subjects after recovering the DecIR and IncIR genes. By imposing the recovered genes on the network of depressed subjects, several new pathways for recovery from depression were successfully discovered.CONCLUSION Depression was associated with activation of the innate immune response and relative inactivation of T cell signalling. DEGs reflect physiological demands that are controlled at the transcriptional level, whereas IRs are a more direct mechanism for monitoring protein homeostasis. Accordingly, IR is a stress response and IR genes are sensors of the physiological state in the cytoplasm. In particular, where ciliary genes were detected by IR analysis, it is expected that there is a defect in ciliary function or immunological synapse in depression. We demonstrate the potential of IR biomarkers in the immunological stratification of depressed patients and their utility in the discovery of novel pathways involved in recovery from depression."

The MLVAType shiny application was previously designed to extract MLVA profiles of Vibrio cholerae isolates from WGS data, and provide backward compatibility with traditional MLVA typing methods. The previous development and validation work was done on short (pair-end 300 and 150 nt long) reads from Illumina MiSeq and Hiseq sequencing. In the initial phase of this work, the MLVAType application was validated on long reads generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platforms. The MLVA profiles of V. cholerae isolates (n=9) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo were produced using the MLVAType application on WGS data. The WGS-derived MLVA profiles were extracted from canu (v.2.2) assemblies obtained through MinION and GridION sequencing by ONT. The results were compared to those obtained from SPAdes assemblies (v3.13.0; k-mer 175) generated from short-read (pair-end 300-bp) data obtained by MiSeq sequencing, Illumina, taken as a reference. For each isolate, the MLVA profiles were concordant for all three sequencing methods, demonstrating that the MLVAType application can accurately predict the MLVA profiles from assembled genomes generated with long-reads ONT sequencers.In the final phase of this study, we conducted phylogenomic analysis on data generated by both sequencing technologies, highlighting the superior resolution of Illumina short-read sequencing compared to the ONT-based approach. However, there was a remarkable concordance between isolate clusters identified using ONT-based MLVA profiles and those derived from the short-read-based phylogenomic analysis. This striking agreement enabled us to identify specific benefits and drawbacks of both technologies."

However, due to the lack of large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies, most of the existing research focused on the cross-sectional changes of brain aging. In this investigation, we present a data-driven approach that incorporate both cross-sectional changes and longitudinal trajectories of structural brain aging and identified two brain aging patterns among 37,013 healthy participants from UK Biobank. Participants with accelerated brain aging also demonstrated accelerated biological aging, cognitive decline and increased genetic susceptibilities to major neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, by integrating longitudinal neuroimaging studies from a multi-center adolescent cohort, we validated the “last in, first out” mirroring hypothesis and identified brain regions with manifested mirroring patterns between brain aging and brain development. Genomic analyses revealed risk loci and genes contributing to accelerated brain aging and delayed brain development, providing molecular basis for elucidating the biological mechanisms underlying brain aging and related disorders."

The framework involves breaking down the selection criteria into multiple questions, properly prompting GPT-3.5 to answer each question, scoring and re-ranking each answer, and combining the responses to make nuanced inclusion or exclusion decisions.Results Large-scale validation was performed on the benchmark of CLEF eHealth 2019 Task 2: Technology-Assisted Reviews in Empirical Medicine. Across 31 datasets of four categories of SRs, the proposed QA framework consistently outperformed other zero-shot ranking models. Compared with our QA-based approach exhibited a clear advantage over traditional models and bespoke BERT-family models that were fine-tuned for ranking tasks (i.e., from the BERT to PubMedBERT), underscoring their high potential in facilitating abstract screening.Conclusion Investigation justified the indispensable value of leveraging selection criteria to improve the performance of automated abstract screening. GPT-3.5 demonstrated proficiency in prioritizing candidate studies for abstract screening using the proposed QA framework. Significant performance improvements were obtained by re-ranking answers using the semantic alignment between abstracts and selection criteria. This further highlighted the pertinence of utilizing selection criteria to enhance abstract screening."

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel non-invasive brain stimulation method that has demonstrated treatment efficacy for major depressive episodes. tDCS is portable, safe, and individuals like having sessions at home. We developed a home-based protocol with real-time remote supervision. In the present study, we have examined the clinical outcomes, acceptability and feasibility of home-based tDCS treatment in bipolar depression. Participants were 44 individuals with bipolar disorder (31 women), mean age 47.27 + 12.89 years, in current depressive episode of moderate to severe severity (mean Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score 24.59 + 2.64). tDCS was provided in a bilateral frontal montage, F3 anode, F4 cathode, 2mA, for 30 minutes, in a 6-week trial, for a total 21 sessions. Participants maintained their current treatment (psychotherapy, antidepressant or mood stabilising medication) or maintained being medication-free. A researcher was present by video call at each session. 93.2% participants (n=41) completed the 6-week treatment. There was a significant improvement in depressive symptoms following treatment (mean MADRS 8.77 + 5.37), the rate of clinical response was 77.3% (MADRS improvement of <=50% from baseline), and the rate of clinical remission was 47.7% (MADRS rating of <=9). Acceptability was endorsed as “very acceptable” or “quite acceptable” by all participants. No participants developed mania or hypomania. Due to the open-label design, efficacy findings are preliminary. In summary, home-based tDCS with real-time supervision was associated with significant clinical improvements and high acceptability in bipolar depression."

However, in the past years it has become evident that the classical “one gene – one phenotype” model is insufficient to encompass the intricacies of human genetics. Examples are emerging that variants in a gene can cause quite diverging phenotypes depending on the specific location in the gene or on the specific type of variant. In the era of precision medicine this is important knowledge, both when interpreting genomic data, but also when designing treatment strategies.Gain-of-function variants in GFAP leads to protein aggregation and is the cause of the severe neurodegenerative disorder Alexander Disease (AxD), while loss of GFAP function has been considered benign. Here, we report a loss-of-function variant in GFAP as the cause of optico-retinal dysplasia and vision impairment in a six-generation family.Whole genome sequencing analysis of family members with gliosis of the optic nerve head and visual impairment revealed a frameshift variant in GFAP (c.928dup, p.(Met310Asnfs*113)) segregating with disease. Analysis of human embryonic tissues revealed strong expression of GFAP in retinal neural progenitors. A zebrafish model verified that c.928dup does not result in extensive GFAP protein aggregation and zebrafish gfap loss-of-function mutants showed vision impairment and retinal dysplasia, characterized by a significant loss of Müller glia cells and photoreceptor cells.Our findings show how different mutational mechanisms can cause diverging phenotypes and reveal a novel function of GFAP in human eye development."

This study introduces an innovative ensemble machine learning model integrated with the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2022 recommendations to enhance AML risk stratification. The model demonstrated superior performance by utilizing a comprehensive dataset of 1,213 patients from National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and an external cohort of 2,113 patients from UK-NCRI trials. On the external cohort, it improved a concordance index (c-index) from 0.61 to 0.64 and effectively distinguished three different risk levels with median hazard ratios ranging from 18% to 50% improved. Key insights were gained from the discovered significant features influencing risk prediction, including age, genetic mutations, and hematological parameters. Notably, the model identified specific cytogenetic and molecular alterations like TP53, IDH2, SRSF2, STAG2, KIT, TET2, and karyotype (-5, -7, -15, inv(16)), alongside age and platelet counts. Additionally, the study explored variations in the effectiveness of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) across different risk levels, offering new perspectives on treatment effects. In summary, this study develops an ensemble model based on the NTUH cohort to deliver improved performance in AML risk stratification, showcasing the potential of integrating machine learning techniques with medical guidelines to enhance patient care and personalized medicine."

Abnormally high exertional breathlessness was defined as a breathlessness intensity response (Borg 0-10 scale) > the upper limit of normal (ULN) using published reference equations. Mortality was analyzed using multivariable Cox regression, unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index.Results Of the 13,506 people included (46% female, age 59±15 years), 2,867 (21%) had abnormally high breathlessness during IET. Over a median follow up of 8.0 years, 1,687 (12%) people died. No participant was lost to follow-up. Compared to those within normal predicted ranges, people with abnormally high exertional breathlessness had higher mortality from all causes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.3, [95% confidence interval] 2.1-2.6), respiratory causes (aHR 5.2 [3.4-8.0]) and cardiac causes (aHR 3.0 [2.5-3.6]). Even among people with normal exercise capacity (defined as peak Watt ≥75% of predicted exercise capacity, n=10,284) those with abnormally high exertional breathlessness were at greater risk of all-cause mortality than people with exertional breathlessness within the normal predicted range (aHR 1.5 [1.2-1.8]).Interpretation Among people referred for cycle IET, abnormally high exertional breathlessness, quantified using healthy reference values, independently predicted all-cause, respiratory and cardiac mortality."

We compared plaque morphologies and clinical variables between the PR and NPR cohorts. Binary logistic regression was employed to isolate independent predictors of PR, and the predictive model’s sensitivity and specificity were gauged using the receiver operating characteristic curve.Results A total of 84 patients (mean age 58.07±1.35 years, 78.6% male) were categorized into PR (n=28, 33.3%) or NPR (n=56, 66.4%) groups based on the remodeling index (RI). The PR group exhibited a significantly higher percent plaque burden (P<0.001), wall area (WA) (P<0.001), plaque length (P=0.018), and RI (P<0.001), alongside elevated fasting blood glucose (P=0.01) and a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (P=0.16, 0.025). Logistic regression analysis identified percent plaque burden as an independent predictor of PR (odds ratio, 4.19, per 10% increase; [95% CI, 1.79-9.8]; P=0.001).Conclusion HR-VWI is an effective tool for identifying PR in AIS caused by ICAS, with a high plaque burden being an independent correlate of PR."

To address the problem of small training dataset, we used several data augmentation methods (EDA, UMLS-EDA, text generation and rephrasing with GPT-4) and assessed their impact on the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model. We also fine-tuned PubMedBERT models limited to checklist items associated with specific sections (e.g., Methods) to evaluate whether such models could improve performance compared to the single full model. We performed 5-fold cross-validation and report precision, recall, F1 score, and area under curve (AUC).Results Fine-tuned PubMedBERT model that takes as input the sentence and the surrounding sentence representations and uses section headers yielded the best overall performance (0.71 micro-F1, 0.64 macro-F1). Data augmentation had limited positive effect, UMLS-EDA yielding slightly better results than data augmentation using GPT-4. BioGPT fine-tuning and GPT-4 in-context learning exhibited suboptimal results. Methods-specific model yielded higher performance for methodology items, other section-specific models did not have significant impact.Conclusion Most CONSORT checklist items can be recognized reasonably well with the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model but there is room for improvement. Improved models can underpin the journal editorial workflows and CONSORT adherence checks and can help authors in improving the reporting quality and completeness of their manuscripts."

The probability of whether a treatment is beneficial, although a more intuitive summary of the results, is not provided by most trials. In this study, we developed and released a user-friendly tool that calculates the probability that a treatment studied in a phase III oncology trial is beneficial using published summary statistics.Methods We curated the primary time-to-event outcomes of 415 phase III, superiority design, therapeutic randomized controlled trials of oncologic treatments enrolling 338,600 patients and published between 2004 and 2020. A phase III oncology-specific prior probability distribution for the treatment effect was developed based on an estimated three-component zero-mean mixture distribution of the observed z-scores. Using this prior, we computed the probability of any benefit (hazard ratio < 1) and the probability of clinically meaningful benefit (hazard ratio < 0.8) for each trial. The distribution of signal-to-noise ratios of phase III oncology trials was compared with that of 23,551 randomized trials from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.Results The signal-to-noise ratios of phase III oncology trials tended to be much larger than randomized trials from the Cochrane database. Still, the median power of phase III oncology trials was only 49% (IQR, 14% to 95%), and the power was less than 80% in 65% of trials. Using the developed phase III, oncology-specific prior, only 53% of trials claiming superiority (114 of 216) had a ≥ 90% probability of providing clinically meaningful benefits. Conversely, the probability that the experimental arm was superior to the control arm (HR < 1) exceeded 90% in 17% of trials interpreted as having no benefit (34 of 199).Conclusion By enabling computation of contextual probabilities for the treatment effect from summary statistics, our robust, highly practical tool, now posted on a user-friendly webpage, can aid the wider oncology community in the interpretation of phase III trials."

Early and regular AML/cyst detection and monitoring are vital in lowering TSC patient morbidity and mortality. However, current standard of care for imaging-based methods are not designed for rapid screening, posing challenges for early detection. To identify potential diagnostic screening biomarkers of AML/cysts, we performed global untargeted metabolomics in blood samples from 283 kidney AML/cyst-positive or -negative TSC patients using mass spectrometry. We identified seven highly sensitive chemical features, including octanoic acid, that predict kidney AML/cysts in TSC patients. Patients with elevated octanoic acid have lower levels of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), suggesting that dysregulated peroxisome activity leads to overproduction of octanoic acid via VLCFA oxidation. This study highlights serum metabolites as novel biomarkers for TSC kidney tumor diagnosis and offers valuable metabolic insights into the disease."

Maternal health can be prevented with culturally specific interventions and women’s enhanced access to healthcare facilities, yet women in rural areas in Pakistan are deprived of such interventions. In this study, we assessed the prevalent knowledge and practices of antenatal care and the impact of low- income and gender inequalities on maternal health in rural areas of Pakistan.Method We conducted a cross-sectional study using the Socio-Ecological Model (SEM) in five villages in the Sindh province of Pakistan. We tested hypotheses using descriptive reliability and regression techniques.Results Findings show that the socio-geographical and cultural factors influencing maternal health were embedded within the different levels of SEM. The prevalence of Maternal Health Vulnerabilities (MHV) was high in villages where women had limited literacy and awareness. Of the 352 participants, 173 (49%) women were not literate and could not read pregnancy-related information imparted through leaflets or brochures. Data showed that women consumed less milk, multivitamins, and proper food due to poverty. At the same time, they had restricted access to health facilities: 119 (34%) women had lost their babies after birth. In this study, poverty and gender inequality correlate with MHV (significant 65.60% and .000 and 10.50% and .000, respectively) and exacerbate the situation by complementing each other.Conclusion Culturally appropriate and evidence-based interventions are needed to reduce gender inequality and prioritise women’s and girls’ maternal health needs. This study has considered cultural, social, geographical, and economic factors influencing maternal health. It provides a nuanced account of a complex web of barriers to attaining Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly goals 3, ‘Good health and well-being’ and 5 ‘, Gender equality’."

In addition to violating fundamental rights, it is an attack on the principles of gender equality. GBV is exacerbated in situations of conflict and forced displacement because of the vulnerability it engenders, particularly among women and children. Therefore, caring for victims of GBV in the context of a humanitarian crisis is special because of the specific nature of the context itself. This study aimed to explore the factors that negatively influence the care of survivors of GBV in the context of forced displacement. This was a descriptive and analytical-qualitative study. A total of 26 participants participated in the individual interviews. Most participants were healthcare workers (53,8%). The findings show that barriers to care are sociocultural (fear of stigmatization, ignorance of the benefits of seeking appropriate care and support, self-censorship among GBV survivors, fear or risk of reprisal, honor denied, fear of the aggressor punishment, shame and fear of being repudiated), institutional (lack of qualified human resources to care for GBV survivors, insufficient information on the availability of care services, geographical inaccessibility of care services, lack of confidentiality from service providers, inadequate health care and support systems, low availability of care services, poor quality of care) and financial. Bringing all care services together in one place, such as a one-stop center, is imperative to overcome these obstacles. In this way, it will be possible to improve accessibility to services and enhance the quality of care through effective coordination."

However, biologically meaningful latent space is usually missing if no specific structure is designed. Here, we engineered a novel interpretable generative transcriptional program (iGTP) framework that could model the importance of TP space and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between different biological states. We demonstrate the performance of iGTP in a diverse biological context using Gene Ontology, canonical pathway, and different PPI curation. iGTP not only elucidated the ground truth of cellular responses but also surpassed other deep learning models and traditional bioinformatics methods in functional enrichment tasks. By integrating the latent layer with a graph neural network (GNN) framework, iGTP effectively inferred cellular responses to perturbations. We anticipate that iGTP offers insights at both PPI and TP levels, and holds promise for predicting responses to novel perturbations."

The pathogen-derived enzymes possess specialized activities that are essential for pathogen replication and have naturally been candidates for drug targets. Phenotypic assays detecting the activities of pathogen-derived enzymes and characterizing their inhibition under drugs offer an opportunity for pathogen detection, drug resistance testing for individual patients, and as a research tool for new drug development. Here, we used HIV as an example to develop assays targeting the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme encapsulated in HIV for sensitive detection and phenotypic characterization, with the potential for point-of-care (POC) applications. Specifically, we targeted the complementary (cDNA) generation activity of the HIV RT enzyme by adding engineered RNA as substrates for HIV RT enzyme to generate cDNA products, followed by cDNA amplification and detection facilitated by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or CRISPR-Cas systems. To guide the assay design, we first used qPCR to characterize the cDNA generation activity of HIV RT enzyme. In the LAMP-mediated Product-Amplified RT activity assay (LamPART), the cDNA generation and LAMP amplification were combined into one pot with novel assay designs. When coupled with direct immunocapture of HIV RT enzyme for sample preparation and endpoint lateral flow assays for detection, LamPART detected as few as 20 copies of HIV RT enzyme spiked into 25μL plasma (fingerstick volume), equivalent to a single virion. In the Cas-mediated Product-Amplified RT activity assay (CasPART), we tailored the substrate design to achieve a LoD of 2e4 copies (1.67fM) of HIV RT enzyme. Furthermore, with its phenotypic characterization capability, CasPART was used to characterize the inhibition of HIV RT enzyme under antiretroviral drugs and differentiate between wild-type and mutant HIV RT enzyme for potential phenotypic drug resistance testing. Moreover, the CasPART assay can be readily adapted to target the activity of other pathogen-derived enzymes. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully adapted CasPART to detect HIV integrase with a sensitivity of 83nM. We anticipate the developed approach of detecting enzyme activity with product amplification has the potential for a wide range of pathogen detection and phenotypic characterization."

To address this need, we constructed a framework for SARS-CoV-2 lineage frequency forecasting (CovTransformer), based on the transformer architecture. We designed our framework to navigate challenges such as a limited amount of data with high levels of noise and bias. We first trained and tested the model using data from the UK and the US, and then tested the generalization ability of the model on data collected across the globe. Remarkably, the model makes predictions two months into the future with high levels of accuracy in 31 countries. Finally, we show that our model performed substantially better than the current gold-standard, i.e. a regression-based model implemented in Nextstrain. Overall, our work demonstrates transformer models represent a promising approach for lineage forecasting and pandemic monitoring."

CXCL5 mediates the immune response by attracting immune cells to areas of inflammation. Elevated CXCL5 levels are associated with various inflammatory diseases and tumorigenesis. In addition, smoking is linked to an increase in the level of the cytokine CEACAM6 in the bloodstream of smokers. CEACAM6 is increased in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, non⍰small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer and other cancers and promotes tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. Although cytokine secretion in the innate immune response returns to nonsmoker levels after quitting smoking, the effects on the adaptive response appear to persist for years or decades due to epigenetic memory. As a result, epigenetic changes induced by smoking may contribute to long-lasting alterations in immune function, including elevated CXCL5 and CEACAM6. The effects of cannabis smoking might be similar.Methods In the current study we used UK Biobank (UKB) data to assess the relationship of CXCL5, CEACAM6, and pulmonary function to cigarette and cannabis smoking. Our UK Biobank application was approved as UKB project 57245 (S.L., P.H.R.). Our analysis included all subjects with smoking and/or marijuana use data in the UK Biobank database. Circulating levels of CXCL5 and CEACAM6 were from UKB Olink data. Individual CXCL5 and CEACAM6 levels are NPX, Normalized Protein expression, Olink arbitrary unit in Log2 scale (Olink Proteomics AB, Uppsala, Sweden; http://www.olink.com).Results Current smokers and past smokers had elevated circulating levels of CXCL5 and CECAM6. In multivariate analysis, current, past, or no smoking history was significantly related to CXCL5 level and CECAM6 levels, independent of the effects of age, sex. Frequency of cannabis use had a similar effect. In multivariate analysis, frequency of cannabis use was significantly related to CXCL5 level and CECAM6 levels, independent of the effects of age, sex, and years between last cannabis use and enrollment in study.Conclusion we can confirm a previous report of epigenetic changes induced by cigarette smoking that may contribute to long-lasting alterations in immune function related to CXCL5 and CEACAM6. In addition, we have found that these same long-lasting smoking alterations in immune function related to CXCL5 and CEACAM6 occur in cannabis smokers, possibly rendering them vulnerable to smoking-related tumors in later life."

It is considered an important step in the implementation of knowledge management solutions. By following a maturity model of knowledge sharing, knowledge sharing practices can be improved. The aim of this study was to develop a maturity model knowledge sharing in medical imaging department for helping managers to assess the level of maturity for knowledge sharing practices.Objectives In the modern healthcare institutions, improvements in healthcare professionals’ skills and healthcare services are often driven through practicing knowledge sharing behaviours. To understand the level of maturity of knowledge sharing, mangers can follow the indicators of maturity model knowledge sharing and its measurements in order to identify the current level and move to the next level.Methods This study was conducted in three stages: An ‘overview stage’ which highlighted the factors that affect knowledge sharing practices in medical imaging departments; an ‘Analysis factor stage’ which was designed to assess the factors that affect knowledge sharing by using a concurrent mixed method approach’s (questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews) in two medical imaging departments; and ‘Structuring maturity model knowledge sharing stage’, where a maturity model of knowledge sharing was developed based on the findings of the other stages.Results The model presented in this study includes 17 indicators divided into 11 components. Those components derived from the findings of the questionnaires and semi-structured interviews that were applied in the medical imaging departments. It consists of five maturity levels: initial, aware, define, managed, and optimised. In each level were included measurements in order to help managers to assess the current level by answering to the measurement’s questions.Conclusion This maturity model of knowledge sharing in medical imaging departments allows managers and policy makers to measure the maturity level of knowledge sharing in those departments. Although the model has been applied to the medical imaging departments, it might easily be modified to apply it to other institutions."

Genetic perturbation of hematopoiesis that alters leukocyte production is a novel independent modifier of CAD risk. We examined whether there are shared genetic determinants and causal relationships between leukocyte counts, T1D, and CAD.Methods Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics were utilized to perform pairwise linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and heritability estimation from summary statistics (ρ-HESS) to respectively estimate the genome-wide and local genetic correlations, and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the causal relationships between leukocyte counts (335 855 healthy subjects), T1D (18 942 cases, 501 638 controls), and CAD (122 733 cases, 424 528 controls).Results There was significant genome-wide genetic correlation (rg) between T1D and CAD (rg = 0.088; P = 9.0e-03) and both diseases shared significant genome-wide genetic determinants with eosinophil count (rg(T1D) = 0.093, P = 7.20e-03; rg(CAD) = 0.092, P = 3.68e-06) and lymphocyte count (rg(T1D) = −0.052, P = 2.80e-02; rg(CAD) = 0.1761, P = 1.82e-15). Sixteen independent loci showed stringent Bonferroni significant local genetic correlations between leukocyte counts, T1D and/or CAD. Cis-genetic regulation of the expression levels of genes within loci that are shared between T1D and CAD were associated with both diseases as well as leukocyte counts, including SH2B3, CTSH, MORF4L1, CTRB1, CTRB2, CFDP1, and IFIH1. Genetically predicted lymphocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil counts were associated with T1D and CAD (lymphocyte odds ratio (OR)T1D = 0.667, P = 2.02e-19; ORCAD =1.085, P = 2.67e-06; neutrophil ORT1D = 0.82, P = 5.63e-05; ORCAD = 1.17, P = 5.02e-14; and eosinophil ORT1D: 1.67, P = 4.45e-25; ORCAD: 1.07; P = 2.02e-03).Conclusions/Interpretations This study sheds light on shared genetic mechanisms that underlie T1D and CAD, which may contribute to their co-occurrence through regulation of gene expression and leukocyte counts. This study also identifies molecular targets for further investigation for disease prediction and potential drug discovery.What is already known about the subject?Genetic factors have been shown to contribute to the occurrence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the mechanisms are unknown.Genetic perturbation of hematopoiesis that alters leukocyte production is associated with CAD risk and clinical observations have documented altered leukocyte counts in T1D. However, it is unknown whether altered leukocyte frequencies contribute to T1D and the co-occurrence of T1D and CAD or these reflect reverse causation.What is the key question?Do T1D and CAD share genetic determinants with leukocyte counts, and if so, are genetically predicted leukocyte counts associated with risk of T1D or CAD and their co-occurrence?What are the new findings?T1D and CAD share significant genetic architecture, and both diseases share significant genetic determinants with eosinophil and lymphocyte counts.Genetically predicted eosinophil, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts are associated with risk of T1D and CAD.Genetic regulation of the expression levels of genes in shared loci between T1D and CAD are associated with both diseases and leukocyte counts.How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?Genetic heritability for T1D is shared with CAD risk and leukocyte counts, and the counts of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils are associated with both diseases."

Wearable cardiac monitors, which record single-lead electrocardiogram data, provide information that can be leveraged to infer left atrial pressures.Methods We developed a deep neural network using single-lead electrocardiogram data to determine when the left atrial pressure is elevated. The model was developed and internally evaluated using a cohort of 6739 samples from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and externally validated on a cohort of 4620 samples from a second institution. We then evaluated model on patch-monitor electrocardiographic data on a small prospective cohort.Results The model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 for detecting elevated left atrial pressures on an internal holdout dataset from MGH and 0.76 on an external validation set from a second institution. A further prospective dataset was obtained using single-lead electrocardiogram data with a patch-monitor from patients who underwent right heart catheterization at MGH. Evaluation of the model on this dataset yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.875 for identifying elevated left atrial pressures for electrocardiogram signals acquired close to the time of the right heart catheterization procedure.Conclusions These results demonstrate the utility and the potential of ambulatory cardiac hemodynamic monitoring with electrocardiogram patch-monitors.Plain Language Summary Heart failure is a prevalent disorder that is challenging to manage. Part of what makes heart failure management challenging is that the onset of symptoms can be insidious as there are few robust tools that a clinical can leverage to estimate when a patient is likely to experience an episode of acute heart failure. While elevated intracardiac pressures are a reliable harbinger of worsening heart failure, these pressures are typically measured using an invasive, gold-standard approach, which can only be performed in an inpatient setting. A non-invasive method for detecting higher pressures inside of heart would be especially helpful for identifying worsening heart failure in an expeditious manner in the home environment. For this reason, we developed an artificial intelligence model to detect elevated pressures inside the heart using a non-invasive signal, the electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG), which can be acquired from a wearable patch monitor device. Our results demonstrate that the model provides a reliable platform for the non-invasive assessment of cardiac pressures using data that can be obtained in the outpatient setting."

Suboptimal rates of SDM are particularly prominent amongst patients with psychotic illnesses during antipsychotic treatment choices. Many interventions have been assessed for their efficacy in improving SDM within this context, although results have been variable and inconsistent.Aims To generate an in-depth understanding of how, why, for whom, and to what extent interventions facilitating the application of SDM during choice of antipsychotic drug treatment work and the impact of contextual factors on intervention effectiveness.Methods This review will use realist review methodology to provide a causal understanding of how and why interventions work when implementing SDM during choice of antipsychotic treatment. The review will take place over five stages; (1) Locating existing theories, (2) Searching for evidence, (3) Selecting articles, (4) Extracting and organising data and (5) Synthesizing evidence and drawing conclusions. An understanding of how and why interventions work will be achieved by developing realist programme theories on intervention effectiveness through iterative literature reviews and engaging with various stakeholder groups, including patient, clinician and carer representatives.Discussion This is the first realist review aiming to identify generative mechanisms explaining how and why successful interventions aimed at improving SDM within the parameters outlined work and in which contexts desired outcomes are most likely to be achieved.

There are case reports of severe liver injury in adult SARS-CoV2 patients and some have theorized that acute SARS-CoV2 infection may be a driver of severe liver injury in children. While pediatric hepatic injury has previously been described, clear shifts in immunogenic response secondary to prior immune exposure and vaccination since initial reports from 2020 warrant further evaluation. We sought to identify the impact of variant shifts and vaccination on this phenomenon in children.Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional study of pediatric SARS-CoV2 patients seen at two hospital facilities in an urban neighborhood in New York City between March 2020 and March 2022 was conducted via chart review. Data was extracted relating to patient’s demographics, clinical presentation, including the level of care and the laboratory results of comprehensive metabolic panels (CMP).Results 133 pediatric cases were identified as having positive SARS-CoV2 and CMP obtained in the same visit. Patients were predominantly Black (79.2%) and non-Hispanic (87%) with a mean age of 9.2 years. Risk of transaminase elevation was increased in younger patients and patients with higher level of care. BMI was not a risk factor noted for transaminase elevation. Vaccination decreased degree, not incidence, of transaminase elevation but given low rates of vaccination unable to determine significance of protective efficacy.Conclusions Our study has identified a profound increased risk of transaminase elevation in younger patients, the absence of BMI as a correlating factor in our primarily Black patient population, a shift towards non-specific AST elevation with variant windows and a strong signal of vaccine protection.What is KnownSARS-CoV2 can cause Transaminemia, and in rare cases, possible fulminant hepatic injuryPediatric SARS-CoV2 infections are statistically milder than adult.SARS-Cov2 case severity and complications like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children have declined over timeWhat is NewWith population immunity and variant shifts transaminase elevations increasingly may not be of hepatic originRisk of transaminase elevation is substantially higher in younger patients, and decreases with ageVaccines are protective against degree of transaminase elevation, and likely against incidence of transaminase elevation, although further study is needed.Article Summary Cross sectional study of an urban pediatric population demonstrates SARS-CoV2 transaminase elevation linked with younger age, unvaccinated status, and higher level of care."

This pathology continues to have a high prevalence despite advances in pharmacotherapy and device therapy and given that it is a pathology that significantly impairs the quality of life of patients, the implementation of care is of vital importance. However, these are underused due to lack of knowledge on the part of health personnel and also due to poor implementation in the different health providers.Objective An exploratory review of the literature was carried out regarding the benefits of palliative care in patients with advanced heart failure, in order to synthesize the available and updated evidence.Methodology Searched for articles published from 2017 to 2022 related to palliative care in patients with heart failure and using the PRISMA 2020 methodology for this study. This inquiry of articles was carried out in the following databases: UpToDate, PubMed, MESH, PMC (US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of health).Results A total of 5 articles were obtained, from which they concluded that palliative care has a positive impact on the quality of life of patients with heart failure, there was a lower rate of hospital readmissions, improvements in physical, psychological and existential."

Treatments were ranked with P- and SUCRA scores, with rank robustness measured by Cohen’s kappa, and uncertainty in ranking probabilities estimated with Shannon’s normalized entropy.RESULTS Based on data from 16,971 patients (16 studies), we found Donanemab the best-ranked antibody on cognitive measures. Lecanemab was the most effective at reducing amyloid burden. Caution is needed concerning brain edema and microbleeding, with clinically important risks for Donanemab, Aducanumab and Lecanemab.DISCUSSION Risk/benefit profile of anti-amyloid antibodies remains unfavorable. Patients in Donanemab study were stratified by tau load, with greater effects observed in low/medium tau population.HighlightsNo single therapy ranked the best among all outcomes.Donanemab was the most effective antibody at reducing cognitive decline across all primary outcomes, while Lecanemab ranked the highest on amyloid PET removal.Consistently greater cognitive, functional and biomarker effects of Donanemab were observed in patients with low/medium tau load, suggesting more promising effects in earlier AD stages.All antibodies, except Solanezumab, were significantly less tolerable than Placebo.The risk of cerebral edema and microbleeding may outweigh the benefits, independently of APOE status."

AMR is a huge challenge in India due to high disease burden, lack of etiology-based diagnostic tests and over the counter availability of antibiotics and inadequate treatment of wastewaters are important drivers of AMR in India. There is lack of effective surveillance platforms that monitor health-associated infections. This include developing an understanding on background levels of AMR in the environment and comparison of AMR monitoring methods.Objectives This study evaluated the performance of three AMR sequencing methods, Illumina AmpliSeq AMR panel, QIAseq xHYB AMR panel and shotgun sequencing method for the detection of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in urban sewage. Our goal is to provide insights into the application and robustness of each sequencing method.Methods We compare the prevalence, diversity, and composition of ARGs across sequencing method and by sample type (inlet vs outlet) in four sewage treatment plants (STP).Results Regardless of the sequencing method used the dominant ARGs remained consistent, and their differential analysis showed consistent trends in detection of epidemiologically relevant ARGs. The cost-effectiveness analysis revealed comparable per-sample costs, with amplicon-based sequencing offering specificity for targeted genes, and shotgun sequencing uses a whole-genome sequencing approach that provides high-resolution taxonomic information for the characterisation of pathogens. This methodology can only detect ARGs that have been annotated in the reference database (e.g., CARD). Therefore, some novel types of ARGs present in the samples may be missed since the analysis is based on a similarity search. Differential abundance analysis to understand change in abundance in dominant ARGs from inlet to outlet of STP showed consistent trends across methods. However, with caution raised regarding potential artifacts introduced by enrichment steps in QIAseq xHYB AMR panel.Conclusion The choice of panel used would be governed by the context of the study. Nonetheless, our exploratory study shows that the data gathered using different sequencing pipelines helps in quantifying the ARG burden in the environment. This information is crucial in understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of ARGs in different environment and could help in developing PCR-based approaches for targeted surveillance."

Current actions to reduce this threat include requiring prescriptions for antibiotic use, antibiotic stewardship programs, educational programs targeting patients and healthcare providers, and limiting antibiotic use in agriculture, aquaculture, and animal husbandry. Early warning of the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria would aid these efforts. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrated the value of wastewater surveillance as an early warning system for viral spread and detection of the emergence of new viral strains. In this commentary we explore whether monitoring wastewater for antibiotic resistant genes and/or bacteria resistant to antibiotics might provide similarly useful information for public health action. Using carbapenem resistance as an example, we highlight technical challenges associated with using wastewater to quantify temporal/spatial trends in antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs) and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and compare with clinical information. We also comment on using wastewater to track foodborne outbreaks. We conclude with our assessment that beyond source tracking the value added of screening wastewater for ARBs and ARGs for direct public health action is relatively low with current technologies compared to surveillance methods already in place."

This article explores the factors determining early pregnancy among 15-19-year-old secondary school students in Koudougou in Burkina Faso.Methods A descriptive and exploratory qualitative study was conducted through focus groups with adolescents and youth in schools and individual interviews with parents, teachers, health workers, and community leaders. The socio-ecological model guided all stages of the study. A thematic analysis of the recorded and transcribed data was conducted using Nvivo 12 software.Results A lack of knowledge and information and wrong perceptions about sexuality at the individual level; peer pressure and poverty at the interpersonal level; lack of awareness among teachers and students and health workers’ attitudes at the organizational level; the influence of new information technologies or the media and parents’ irresponsibility at the community level; and the insufficient of sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents as well as the lack of sanctions and law against early pregnancy at the political level were found as enablers. Barriers were the use of contraceptive methods and sexual abstinence; parents-children communication; teachers’ training on sexual sensitization, the creation of youth centers on school campuses and the introduction of sexual education courses; education through media and religion; willingness to introduce sexual education courses in school curricula and legal sanctioning of dealing and consuming drugs in schools.Conclusion The study highlighted that the problem of early pregnancy in schools can be solved by acting on the determinants at all levels of the socioecological model by implementing preventive strategies."

We sought to identify and analyze the barriers and facilitators of using the electronic clinic registry (ECR) for the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) by healthcare providers (HCPs) in the health district of Toma, BF.Methods We conducted a descriptive and exploratory qualitative study. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with thirty-five (35) HCPs in the health district of Toma, BF, from the 1st to the 30th of December 2021. Thematic analysis of qualitative data according to the Braun & Clarke model was performed using NVivo 12 software and arranged along a social-ecological model.Results Our findings revealed that HCPs play an essential role in using ECR for IMCI. Many key facilitating factors have emerged regarding the use of IMCIs in primary health care (PHC) facilities, such as positive perceptions of the ECR, firm commitment and the involvement of HCPs, stakeholder support, collaborative networks with implementing partners, convenience, privacy, confidentiality and client trust, experience and confidence in using the system, and the satisfaction, motivation and competency of staff. In addition, the easy diagnosis offered by the ECR and the training of HCPs increased the acceptance and use of the ECR. Regarding barriers, HCPs complained about the tablet’s slowness, recurrent breakdowns, and increased workload.Conclusion This study revealed that ECR has excellent potential to improve the quality of care and, in turn, reduce maternal and infant mortality. Although the satisfaction of the HCPs with the tool is positive, the actors of the Foundation Tdh, in collaboration with the MHPH, must work to optimize the application’s performance and reduce breakdowns and delays during consultations. This will allow the deployment of ECR in all BF health districts."

This study investigated undergraduate medical students’ and medical educators’ opinions of teleconsultation practice in general and their opinions of teleconsultation education.Methods This study used a cross-sectional, mixed-methods approach, utilising the additional coverage design to sequence and integrate qualitative and quantitative data. An online questionnaire was sent out to all medical schools in the UK, inviting undergraduate medical students and medical educators to participate. Questionnaire participants were given the opportunity to take part in a qualitative semi-structured interview. Descriptive and correlation analyses and a thematic analysis were conducted.Results A total of 248 participants completed the questionnaire and 23 interviews were conducted. Saving time and the reduced risks of transmitting infectious diseases were identified as common advantages of using teleconsultation. However, concerns about confidentiality and accessibility to services were expressed by students and educators. Eight themes were identified from the thematic analysis. The themes relevant to teleconsultation practice were (1) The benefit of teleconsultations, (2) A second-best option, (3) Patient choice, (4) Teleconsultations differ from in-person interactions, and (5) Impact on the healthcare system. The themes relevant to teleconsultation education were (6) Considerations and reflections on required skills, (7) Learning and teaching content, and (8) The future of teleconsultation education.Discussion The results of this study have implications for both medical practice and education. Patient confidentiality, safety, respecting patients’ preferences, and accessibility are important considerations for implementing teleconsultations in practice. Education should focus on assessing the appropriateness of teleconsultations, offering accessible and equal care, and developing skills for effective communication and clinical reasoning. High-quality teleconsultation education can influence teleconsultation practice."

Understanding the genetic and molecular factors influencing ALS survival is crucial for disease management and therapeutics. In this study, we introduce a deep learning-powered genetic analysis framework to link rare noncoding genetic variants to ALS survival. Using data from human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MNs, this method prioritizes functional noncoding variants using deep learning, links cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to target genes using epigenomics data, and integrates these data through gene-level burden tests to identify survival-modifying variants, CREs, and genes. We apply this approach to analyze 6,715 ALS genomes, and pinpoint four novel rare noncoding variants associated with survival, including chr7:76,009,472:C>T linked to CCDC146. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of this variant increases CCDC146 expression in iPSC-derived MNs and exacerbates ALS-specific phenotypes, including TDP-43 mislocalization. Suppressing CCDC146 with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), showing no toxicity, completely rescues ALS-associated survival defects in neurons derived from sporadic ALS patients and from carriers of the ALS-associated G4C2-repeat expansion within C9ORF72. ASO targeting of CCDC146 may be a broadly effective therapeutic approach for ALS. Our framework provides a generic and powerful approach for studying noncoding genetics of complex human diseases."

In adjusted analyses, treatment with XR-NTX was more likely to result in discontinuation or death by the end of follow-up than treatment with SL-BUP: cumulative risk 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75%, 78%) versus 62% (95% CI 61%, 63%), respectively (risk difference 14 percentage points, 95% CI 13, 16). There was minimal difference in the cumulative risk of overdose or death by the end of follow-up: XR-NTX 3.8% (95% CI 2.9%, 4.7%) versus SL-BUP 3.3% (95% 2.9%, 3.7%); risk difference 0.5 percentage points, 95%CI-0.5, 1.5. Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses.Conclusions Longer medication retention is important because risks of negative outcomes are elevated after discontinuation. Our results support selection of SL-BUP over XR-NTX. However, most patients discontinued medication by 6 months indicating that more effective tools are needed to improve medication retention, particularly after initiation with XR-NTX, and to identify which patients do best on which medication."

Options for prevention include left atrial appendage closure devices or oral anticoagulation. However, it remains unclear which option may be superior overall.Methods We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of all clinical trials comparing the WATCHMAN, Amplatzer Amulet (Amulet), and/or OACs. The primary outcomes of interest were any stroke and all-cause death. Safety outcomes included any thromboembolism, device embolization, and pericardial effusion. We calculated risk ratios and heterogeneity statistics for eacjowh comparison, and calculated the probability of intervention superiority where at least one comparison was significant.Results There were 441 articles identified from the search, from which 5 eligible RCTs were identified (n=1,811). Compared to OACs (all warfarin), risk of stroke was non-significantly decreased with WATCHMAN (RR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.72, I2=13.4%), but risk with Amulet was non-significantly lower than WATCHMAN (RR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.81). However, observed risk of all-cause death was significantly lower with Amulet than OAC (RR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.85, I2=0%) and trended towards significance versus WATCHMAN (RR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.55, 1.02, p=0.06). The P-score was 0.982, signifying a >98% probability Amulet was superior to all alternatives. Risk of thromboembolism was non-significantly increased with WATCHMAN (RR=2.04, 95% CI: 0.23, 18.4) and Amulet (RR=1.54, 95% CI: 0.11, 22.1), with head-to-head comparison favoring Amulet (RR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.17, 3.38, I2=0%). Versus WATCHMAN, device embolization risk was non-significantly elevated with Amulet (RR= 2.38, 95% CI: 0.67, 8.43, I2=0%). Finally, risk of pericardial effusion was significantly elevated with Amulet versus OACs (RR=27.0, 95% CI: 3.48, 210) and versus WATCHMAN (RR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.41, 3.17, I2=0%). The inverse P-score for Amulet (0.9995) indicated a very high probability Amulet was inferior to alternatives.Conclusion While risk of some adverse events was greater with Amulet, we estimated >98% probability Amulet is superior to alternatives in risk of death. Pooled patient-level analyses are warranted."

The ability to analyze extensive DNA sequences using methods amenable to conventional computer hardware has proven invaluable, especially in timely response to global pandemics such as COVID-19.Objectives This study introduces a new representation that encodes DNA sequences in unit vector transitions in a 2D space, extracted from the 2019 repository Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR). The main objective is to elucidate the potential of this method to facilitate virus classification using minimal hardware resources. It also aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the technique through dimensionality reduction and the application of machine learning models.Methods DNA sequences were transformed into two-nucleotide base transitions (referred to as ‘transitions’). Each transition was represented as a corresponding unit vector in 2D space. This coding scheme allowed DNA sequences to be efficiently represented as dynamic transitions. After applying a moving average and resampling, these transitions underwent dimensionality reduction processes such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). After subsequent processing and dimensionality reduction, conventional machine learning approaches were applied, obtaining as output a multiple classification among six species of viruses belonging to the coronaviridae family, including SARS-CoV-2.Results and Discussions The implemented method effectively facilitated a careful representation of the sequences, allowing visual differentiation between six types of viruses from the Coronaviridae family through direct plotting. The results obtained by this technique reveal values accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score equal to or greater than 99%, applied in a stratified cross-validation, used to evaluate the model. The results found produced performance comparable, if not superior, to the computationally intensive methods discussed in the state of the art.Conclusions The proposed coding method appears as a computationally efficient and promising addition to contemporary DNA sequence coding techniques. Its merits lie in its simplicity, visual interpretability and ease of implementation, making it a potential resource in complementing existing strategies in the field."

Federal agencies, including ONC, CDC, and CMS, have been collectively collaborating to promote interoperability by adopting Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). However, the heterogeneous structures and formats of health data present challenges when transforming Electronic Health Record (EHR) data into FHIR resources. This challenge becomes more significant when critical health information is embedded in unstructured data rather than well-organized structured formats. Previous studies relied on multiple separate rule-based or deep learning-based NLP tools to complete the FHIR resource transformation, which demands substantial development costs, extensive training data, and meticulous integration of multiple individual NLP tools. In this study, we assessed the ability of large language models (LLMs) to transform clinical narratives into HL7 FHIR resources. We developed FHIR-GPT specifically for the transformation of clinical texts into FHIR medication statement resources. In our experiments using 3,671 snippets of clinical texts, FHIR-GPT demonstrated an exceptional exact match rate of over 90%, surpassing the performance of existing methods. FHIR-GPT improved the exact match rates of existing NLP pipelines by 3% for routes, 12% for dose quantities, 35% for reasons, 42% for forms, and over 50% for timing schedules. Our findings provide the foundations for leveraging LLMs to enhance health data interoperability. Future studies will aim to build upon these successes by extending the generation to additional FHIR resources."

However, an equivalent investigation in critically ill adults remains conspicuously absent. We retrospectively analyzed whole exome sequencing (WES) data available through the PennMedicine Biobank (PMBB) from all 365 young adult patients, aged 18-40 years, with intensive care unit (ICU) admissions at the University of Pennsylvania Health System who met inclusion criteria for our study. For each participant, two Medical Genetics and Internal Medicine-trained clinicians reviewed WES reports and patient charts for variant classification, result interpretation, and identification of genetic diagnoses related to their critical illness.Of the 365 individuals in our study, 90 (24.7%) were found to have clearly diagnostic results on WES; an additional 40 (11.0%) had a suspicious variant of uncertain significance (VUS) identified; and an additional 16 (4.4%) had a medically actionable incidental finding. The diagnostic rate of exome sequencing did not decrease with increasing patient age. Affected genes were primarily involved in cardiac function (18.8%), vascular health (16.7%), cancer (16.7%), and pulmonary disease (11.5%). Only half of all diagnostic findings were known and documented in the patient chart at the time of ICU admission. Significant disparities emerged in subgroup analysis by EHR-reported race, with genetic diagnoses known/documented for 63.5% of White patients at the time of ICU admission but only for 28.6% of Black or Hispanic patients. There was a trend towards patients with undocumented genetic diagnoses having a 66% increased mortality rate, making these race-based disparities in genetic diagnosis even more concerning. Altogether, universal exome sequencing in ICU-admitted adult patients was found to yield a new definitive diagnosis in 11.2% of patients. Of these diagnoses, 76.6% conferred specific care-altering medical management recommendations.Our study suggests that the diagnostic utility of exome sequencing in critically ill young adults is similar to that observed in neonatal and pediatric populations and is age-independent. The high diagnostic rate and striking race-based disparities we find in genetic diagnoses argue for broad and universal approaches to genetic testing for critically ill adults. The widespread implementation of comprehensive genetic sequencing in the adult population promises to enhance medical care for all individuals and holds the potential to rectify disparities in genetic testing referrals, ultimately promoting more equitable healthcare delivery."

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are being developed to identify high polygenic risk individuals. Due to differences in genetic background, PRS distributions vary by ancestry, necessitating calibration.Methods We compared four calibration methods using the All of Us Research Program Whole Genome Sequence data for a CRC PRS previously developed in participants of European and East Asian ancestry. The methods contrasted results from linear models with A) the entire data set or an ancestrally diverse training set AND B) covariates including principal components of ancestry or admixture. Calibration with the training set adjusted the variance in addition to the mean.Results All methods performed similarly within ancestry with OR (95% C.I.) per s.d. change in PRS: African 1.5 (1.02, 2.08), Admixed American 2.2 (1.27, 3.85), European 1.6 (1.43, 1.89), and Middle Eastern 1.1 (0.71, 1.63). Using admixture and an ancestrally diverse training set provided distributions closest to standard Normal with accurate upper tail frequencies.Conclusion Although the PRS is predictive of CRC risk for most ancestries, its performance varies by ancestry. Post-hoc calibration preserves the risk prediction within ancestries. Training a calibration model on ancestrally diverse participants to adjust both the mean and variance of the PRS, using admixture as covariates, created standard Normal z-scores. These z-scores can be used to identify patients at high polygenic risk, and can be incorporated into comprehensive risk scores including other known risk factors, allowing for more precise risk estimates."

This is relevant not only from a representation standpoint but also because of admixed populations’ unique features, including being enriched for rare variants, for which effect sizes are disproportionately larger than common polymorphisms. Furthermore, results from these populations may be generalizable to other populations. The South African Cape Coloured (SACC) population is genetically admixed, with one of the highest prevalences of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) worldwide. We profiled its admixture and examined associations between ancestry profiles and FASD outcomes using two longitudinal birth cohorts (N=308 mothers, 280 children) designed to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on development. Participants were genotyped via MEGA-ex array to capture common and rare variants. Rare variants were overrepresented in our SACC cohorts, with numerous polymorphisms being monomorphic in other reference populations (e.g., ∼30,000 and ∼221,000 variants in gnomAD European and Asian populations, respectively). The cohorts showed global African (51%; Bantu and San); European (26%; Northern/Western); South Asian (18%); and East Asian (5%; largely Southern regions) ancestries. The cohorts exhibited high rates of homozygosity (6%), with regions of homozygosity harboring more deleterious variants when lying within African local-ancestry genomic segments. Both maternal and child ancestry profiles were associated with FASD risk and altered severity of prenatal alcohol exposure-related cognitive deficits in the child. Our findings indicate that the SACC population may be a valuable asset to identify novel disease-associated genetic loci for FASD and other diseases."

The purpose of this study was to establish a trained, automatic machine learning aortic zone segmentation model to facilitate performance of an aortic zone volumetric comparison between auTBAD patients based on rate of aortic growth.Methods Patients with auTBAD and serial imaging were identified. For each patient, imaging characteristics from two CT scans were analyzed: (1) the baseline CTA at index admission, and (2) either the most recent surveillance CTA, or the most recent CTA prior to an aortic intervention. Patients were stratified into two comparative groups based on aortic growth: rapid growth (diameter increase ≥5mm/year) and no/slow growth (diameter increase <5mm/year).Deidentified images were imported into an open-source software package for medical image analysis and randomly partitioned into training(80%), validation(10%), and testing(10%) cohorts. Training datasets were manually segmented based on SVS/STS criteria. A custom segmentation framework was used to generate the predicted segmentation output and aortic zone volumes.Results Of 59 patients identified for inclusion, rapid growth was observed in 33 (56%) patients and no/slow growth was observed in 26 (44%) patients. There were no differences in baseline demographics, comorbidities, admission mean arterial pressure, number of discharge antihypertensives, or high-risk imaging characteristics between groups (p>0.05 for all). Median duration between baseline and interval CT was 1.07 years (IQR 0.38-2.57). Post-discharge aortic intervention was performed in 13 (22%) of patients at a mean of 1.5±1.2 years, with no difference between groups (p>0.05). In both groups, all zones of the thoracic and abdominal aorta increased in volume over time, with the largest relative increase in Zone 5 with a median 24% increase (IQR 4.4-37). Baseline zone 3 volumes were larger in the no/slow growth (6v3) than the rapid growth group (5v3) (p=0.03). There were no other differences in baseline zone volumes between groups (p>0.05 for all). Dice coefficient, a performance measure of the model output, was 0.73. Performance was best in Zones 4 (0.82), 5(0.88), and 9(0.91).Conclusions To our knowledge this is the first description of an automatic deep learning segmentation model incorporating SVS-defined aortic zones. The open-source, trained model demonstrates high concordance to the manually segmented aortas with the strongest performance in zones 4, 5, and 9, providing a framework for further clinical applications. In our limited sample, there were no differences in baseline aortic zone volumes between rapid growth and no/slow growth patients.Type of Research Single-center retrospective cohort studyKey Findings A deep learning model was developed to analyze volumetric growth in patients with medically managed acute uncomplicated type B aortic dissection. Volumetric growth was most pronounced in zones 5 (24%), 4 (13%), and 3 (11%). Model performance was best in zones 4, 5, and 9.Take Home Message A trained, automated, open-source aortic zone segmentation model can accurately track changes in aortic growth by zone over time, providing framework for further clinical applications.Table of Contents Summary A trained, automated model was developed to analyze aortic zone volumetric growth in a retrospective study of 59 patients with medically managed acute uncomplicated TBAD. Volumetric growth was most pronounced in zones 3-5, while model performance was best in zones 4,5, and 9."

Separate regression models built for each outcome and included i) each covariate separately, ii) demographic factors (iii) demographic, practice, and areal-level factors.Results Upon full adjustment Arab, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, mixed white and Asian, other white and other ethnic group people with MLTCs have both lower levels of satisfaction with primary care access and interacting with healthcare professionals compared with white British people. The influence of demographic, practice and area-level factors is not uniform across ethnic groups. For example, demographic factors account for the inequalities in levels of satisfaction with access to primary care between white British people and Black other, mixed other, mixed white & Black Caribbean and Gypsy & Irish Travellers. However, practice and area-level factors strengthen inequalities in the experience of accessing primary care for Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani people.Conclusions Given that patient experience is a key aspect of healthcare quality and is said to be associated with favourable health outcomes, the inequalities identified in this study are concerning. The poorer experiences of primary care might be one mechanism by which people with MLTCs from minoritised ethnic groups have poorer health outcomes. In addition to the assessment of other practice and area-level factors, qualitative studies are required to understand and effectively address the sources of ethnic inequalities in primary care experiences for people with MLTCs."

Subconcussions are considered less serious and were overlooked until recently, but we now realise repetitive subconcussions, such as repetitive head impacts, can lead to serious neurological deficits. Subconcussions are common in contact sports, and the military where certain personnel are exposed to repetitive occupational blast overpressure. Postmortem studies in athletes reveal that cumulative duration of play and force from collisions are better predictors than concussion history for the presence and severity of chronic traumatic encephalopathy – a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative tauopathy, distinct from concussion, thought to be caused by repetitive head impacts, and only diagnosable postmortem – thus, an in vivo predictive biomarker would be game changing. Magnetoencephalography has exceptional temporal sampling for imaging the dynamics of neuronal electrochemical action, and functional MRI shows that functional connectivity is associated with tauopathy patterns. Therefore, both imaging modalities could provide a surrogate biomarker of tauopathy.In this cross-sectional study, we examined the effects of repetitive subconcussion on neuronal activity and functional connectivity using magnetoencephalography and functional MRI, and on neurological symptoms and mental health in a military sample. For magnetoencephalography and outcome analyses, 81 participants were split into ‘high’ and ‘low’ blast exposure groups using the generalized blast exposure value: n=41 high blast (26.4–65.7 years; 4 females); n=40 low blast (28.0–63.3 years; 8 females). For fMRI, two high blast male participants without data were excluded: n=39 (29.6–65.7 years).Magnetoencephalography revealed disrupted neuronal activity in participants with a greater history of repetitive subconcussions, including: neural slowing (excessive delta activity) in the right frontal and temporal lobes and subcortical regions (hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, pallidum, thalamus), and functional dysconnectivity in the posterior default mode network (low and high gamma). Notably, these irregularities were independent of concussion or traumatic stress history, and magnetoencephalography revealed functional dysconnectivity not detected with functional MRI. Besides regional slowing and functional disconnection in crucial brain hubs, those with greater blast exposure had poorer neurological outcomes in somatic and cognitive domains, with no blast-related differences in mental health and no associations between neurological symptoms and neuronal activity.This study suggests that repetitive subconcussions have insidious effects on the brain and that magnetoencephalography provides a potential avenue for both treatment targets by identifying affected brain regions and in prevention by identifying those at risk of cumulative subconcussive neurotrauma."

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) emerges as a potential therapeutic avenue for such cases. To shed light on the thalamo-cortical epileptogenic networks and refine prognostic indicators and treatments, we conducted an exhaustive examination of interictal data from thalamic stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) recordings in a substantial patient cohort (n=121). Our investigation delved into thalamo-cortical connectivity, interictal hyperexcitability biomarkers, and their associations with clinical parameters during both rest and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep states.Methodology We conducted an observational study retrospectively gathering data from patients who underwent stereotactic-EEG with thalamic implantation as part of pre-surgical evaluation. Interictal recordings during rest and NREM sleep were analyzed to detect spikes and fast ripples automatically. Functional connectivity between the thalamus and other brain regions (involved or non-involved in the epileptogenic network) was examined using linear regression analysis (R2), while statistical evaluations assessed relationships between these measures, patient outcomes, and clinical variables.Results Elevated rates of thalamic spikes and fast ripples during sleep were linked to unfavorable surgical outcomes (Engel class III/IV) compared to favorable outcomes (Engel class I/II). Thalamo-cortical functional connectivity analysis revealed heightened thalamic strength, particularly in the beta and gamma bands during sleep, among patients with poor surgical outcomes, especially with non-involved networks. Conversely, during rest, lower spike and fast ripple rates were observed in patients with longer epilepsy durations. Furthermore, thalamic strength values during resting state were diminished in patients with prolonged epilepsy durations and older age.Discussion Our study uncovered heightened thalamic interictal activity and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity during sleep in patients with unfavorable surgical outcomes, within the largest cohort of patients with thalamic recordings documented. These findings inform pre-surgical assessments, aiding in identifying patients unsuitable for surgery and suggesting alternative interventions like DBS. Additionally, diminished thalamic activity and connectivity associated with epilepsy duration and age prompt speculation on the role of the thalamus as a pivotal hub in aging-related processes. Vigilance state-dependent insights from the thalamus underscore the necessity for comprehensive analyses to tailor stimulation protocols, facilitating a personalized therapeutic approach."

However, our current mechanistic understanding of these dysfunctions and relationships is imprecise.Study Design The present study used mathematical modeling to uncover cognitive processes driving gaze perception abnormalities in SZ and BD, and how they relate to cognition, symptoms, and social functioning. We modeled the behavior of 28 SZ, 38 BD, and 34 controls (HC) in a self-referential gaze perception task using drift-diffusion models (DDM) parameterized to index key cognitive components: drift rate (evidence accumulation efficiency), drift bias (perceptual bias), start point (expectation bias), threshold separation (response caution), and non-decision time (encoding/motor processes).Study Results Results revealed that aberrant gaze perception in SZ and BD was driven by less efficient evidence accumulation, perceptual biases predisposing self-referential responses, and greater caution (SZ only). Across SZ and HC, poorer social functioning was related to greater expectation biases. Within SZ, perceptual and expectancy biases were associated with hallucination and delusion severity, respectively.Conclusions These findings indicate that diminished evidence accumulation and perceptual biases may underlie altered gaze perception in patients and that SZ may engage in compensatory cautiousness, sacrificing RT to preserve accuracy. Moreover, biases at the belief and perceptual levels may relate to symptoms and functioning. Computational modeling can, therefore, be used to achieve a more nuanced, cognitive process-level understanding of the mechanisms of social cognitive difficulties, like gaze perception, in individuals with SZ and BD."

All V. cholerae O1 isolates were classified into the AFR10d and AFR10e sublineages of AFR10 lineage, originating from the third wave of the seventh El Tor cholera pandemic (7PET). Compared to the strains analysed between 2014 and 2017, we observed only limited genetic changes in the core genome of both sublineages. However, AFR10e expanded across the four provinces, whereas AFR10d appeared to become extinct by the end of 2020. The V. cholerae isolates from 2022 exhibited significant rearrangement in the CTX prophage and associated phage satellites. Notably, this included the tandem repeat of a novel environmental satellite phage RS1 downstream the ctxB toxin gene of the CTX-Φ-3 prophage on the large chromosome, and two tandemly arrayed copies of the pre-CTX-Φ prophage precursor on the small chromosome. In conclusion, while the core genome of V. cholerae O1 AFR10d and AFR10e sublineages showed minimal changes, significant alterations in the content and organisation of elements associated with the CTX-Φ and pre-CTX prophages were identified in AFR10e V. cholerae O1 isolated in 2022."

While thoracotomy with femoro-femoral bypass is an established method for minimally invasive open-heart surgeries, thoracotomy with conventional cannulation is still being explored. In our center, we conducted 958 valvular heart surgery cases using the right anterolateral thoracotomy approach with central cannulation and data were analyzed.Methods This is a retrospective observational study based on prospectively collected data from patients who underwent valvular heart surgery at our center spanning from April 2013 to April 2023. The data encompass demographics, procedures, operative techniques, post-operative morbidity, mortality, and a 1-month follow-up.Results Our study revealed no procedure-related mortality. No patient required conversion to median sternotomy. Smooth cannulation and satisfactory exposure were achieved in all patients. The study encompassed a wide age range, from 14 to 68 years, with 618 female patients (64.5%) and 340 male patients (35.5%).The average cross-clamp time ranged from 38 to 90 minutes, the duration of cardio-pulmonary bypass ranged from 45 to 105 minutes, post-operative extubation ranged from 3 to 8 hours, the average drain volume ranged from 100 to 350 ml, and the incision size ranged from 5 to 7 cm.Conclusions Our data demonstrate that conventional cannulation via the right antero-lateral thoracotomy approach for valvular heart disease is a viable alternative to reduce the side effects associated with sternotomy and femoral cannulation. This procedure is safe, reproducible, and provides the same level of treatment quality."

We developed and validated a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) strategy to extract functional status assessments from unstructured clinical notes.Methods We identified 26,577 HF patients across outpatient services at Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH), Greenwich Hospital (GH), and Northeast Medical Group (NMG) (mean age 76.1 years; 52.0% women). We used expert annotated notes from YNHH for model development/internal testing and from GH and NMG for external validation. The primary outcomes were NLP models to detect (a) explicit New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, (b) HF symptoms during activity or rest, and (c) functional status assessment frequency.Results Among 3,000 expert-annotated notes, 13.6% mentioned NYHA class, and 26.5% described HF symptoms. The model to detect NYHA classes achieved a class-weighted AUROC of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-1.00) at YNHH, 0.98 (0.96-1.00) at NMG, and 0.98 (0.92-1.00) at GH. The activity-related HF symptom model achieved an AUROC of 0.94 (0.89-0.98) at YNHH, 0.94 (0.91-0.97) at NMG, and 0.95 (0.92-0.99) at GH. Deploying the NYHA model among 166,655 unannotated notes from YNHH identified 21,528 (12.9%) with NYHA mentions and 17,642 encounters (10.5%) classifiable into functional status groups based on activity-related symptoms.Conclusions We developed and validated an NLP approach to extract NYHA classification and activity-related HF symptoms from clinical notes, enhancing the ability to track optimal care and identify trial-eligible patients."

Although several non-pharmacological interventions have proven effective in relieving pain in patients with PD, the optimal treatment remains unknown. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) will aim to compare and rank the analgesic effects of different non-drug interventions for PD.Methods and analysis Randomized controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions for PD will be identified via a search of the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases until May 2024. The primary outcome will be change in pain intensity among patients with PD, while the secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Two independent reviewers will perform document screening, study selection, and data extraction. The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (V. 2). The RevMan, Stata, and Aggregate Data Drug Information System software will be used to perform a pairwise meta-analysis and Bayesian NMA in a random-effects model. The certainty of the evidence will be rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation System.Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval will not be required for this study because all data will be obtained from published research. The findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDYThis will be the first study to comprehensively compare the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for primary dysmenorrhea using network meta-analysis.The study will assess both short- and long-term efficacies of various non-pharmacological interventions in mitigating pain intensity among patients with primary dysmenorrhea.This systematic review will be conducted in compliance with the Cochrane Handbook guidelines, which will ensure methodological rigor.Only trials from English databases will be included, which may lead to omission of eligible studies in other languages.The efficacy of different regimens of the same non-pharmacological intervention will not be investigated in this study."

By dissecting the distribution patterns and identifying areas of critical need, the research seeks to inform policy interventions that can more effectively bridge the gap on health worker quantity and inequity.Methods We conducted a descriptive analysis of healthcare workforce data across all 514 districts in Indonesia. The study focused on five categories of health workers: General Practitioners (GPs), medical specialists, dentists, nurses, and midwives. We calculated the health worker ratio to determine the availability of healthcare workers relative to the population. To evaluate the distribution of these workers, we employed the Gini Index as a measure of distribution equality. Additionally, we conducted a comparative metric approach to assess both the quantity and the equity of healthcare worker distribution across the districts.Results In Indonesia, the current health worker ratio stands at 3.84 per 1000 population, falling short of the WHO’s threshold of 4.45 for achieving 80% Universal Health Coverage. This shortfall translates to a need for an additional 166,000 health workers. Our analysis reveals a varied distribution of health worker categories: while midwives show a relatively equitable distribution, specialists and dentists exhibit significant inequality, especially at the district level. The Gini Index, used to measure this inequality, indicates greater disparities at the district level compared to the provincial level. There has been notable progress in the distribution of medical specialists across provinces, with the between-provinces Gini Index for specialists decreasing from 0.57 in 1993 to 0.44 in 2022. However, the inter-district Gini Index remains high at 0.53 in 2022, signifying a concentration of specialists in major cities and provincial capitals.Conclusion This study shows that human resources for health in Indonesia suffer not only in quantity but also in distribution. Our finding underscores the importance of considering inter-province and inter-district disparities to tailor policies to tackle unique problems each region faces.Evidence Before StudyPrior research has established that the quantity and distribution of health workers are critical factors in improving life expectancy and are fundamental components of the health system.Following Indonesia’s constitutional changes in 2001, which included the autonomy and decentralization of healthcare services, assessing the number of health workers at the district level has gained significant importance for determining national healthcare needs.There has been a notable gap in studies analyzing the quantity and distribution of health workers in Indonesia’s district level. Previous research often missed the nuances of district-level challenges, focusing instead on broader, national-level assessments.What This Study AddsFirst National Study on Health Workforce: This is the first study of health workforce quantity and distribution at Indonesia’s National level. so this paper serves as a basic reference for future researchQuantitative Analysis of Distribution Equity: Utilizing the Gini Index, the study quantifies the level of inequality in the distribution of healthcare workers, offering a clear metric to guide policymakers in assessing and addressing regional disparities.Identification of Regional Variations: The study highlights significant regional variations, with some provinces showing an inequitable distribution of health workers, demonstrating a critical need for increased healthcare personnel and better distribution strategies.Dual-dimensional assessment: The study introduces a quadrant comparative approach that simultaneously evaluates the quantity of healthcare workers and the equity of their distribution across Indonesian provinces. This dual-dimensional analysis is a significant methodological advancement, providing a more holistic understanding of healthcare workforce allocation.How This Study Might Affect Research, Practice, and/or Policy This study has the potential to become the basis of policy-making related to the distribution of health workers and provide constructive feedback and strategical insights that could be utilized to decrease the gap between health workers and their maldistribution."

We estimated the slope (average change) of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over a period of 10 years. Then, using the annual health-check results and prescription claims for the first five years from 2012 to 2016 as predictor variables, we developed an XGBoost model, evaluated its prediction performance with the root mean squared error (RMSE), R2, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for rapid decliners (defined as the slope <-3 ml/min/1.73 m2/year) using 5-fold cross validation, and compared these indicators with those of the linear regression model using only eGFR data from 2012 to 2016.Results We included 126 424 individuals (mean age, 45.2 years; male, 82.4%; mean eGFR, 79.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 2016). The mean slope was -0.89 (standard deviation, 0.96) ml/min/1.73 m2/year. The predictive performance of the XGBoost model (RMSE, 0.78; R2, 0.35; and AUROC, 0.89) was better than that of the linear regression model using only eGFR data (RMSE, 1.94; R2, -3.03; and AUROC, 0.79).Conclusion Application of machine learning to annual health-check and claims data could predict the rate of kidney function decline, whereas the linear regression model using only eGFR data did not work."

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to intensive (target: 110 to <130 mmHg) or standard (target: 130 to < 150 mmHg) SBP-lowering treatment. LV mass (LVM) was assessed by two-dimensional, M-mode, color flow Doppler echocardiography. LV hypertrophy (LVH) was diagnosed according to LVM index (LVMI) to height1.7 using sex-specific thresholds.Results Baseline demographic and LV parameters were comparable between the groups (n = 5709). During the median follow-up of 2.63 years, intensive treatment was associated with a lower risk of new LVH (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–1.00, P = 0.051) and greater regression of mean LVMI by 0.38 g/m1.7 per year (95% CI 0.05–0.71, P = 0.024). The rate of baseline LVH regression did not differ between the groups. Male patients achieved a significantly greater benefit from intensive treatment than female patients in terms of new LVH prevention and baseline LVH regression (both P for interaction <0.10). The favorable effect of intensive treatment on the cardiovascular outcome (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–1.00) was slightly attenuated after adjusting for LVMI as a time-varying covariate (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.55–1.03).Conclusions In older patients with hypertension, intensive SBP lowering offers additional cardiovascular benefits in terms of LV geometry. This favorable effect partially explains the reduction in cardiovascular events.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03015311)Condensed Abstract This is the first randomized controlled trial with a sufficient sample size to compare the effect of intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering (<130 mmHg) on echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) geometry with that of standard SBP lowering (< 150 mmHg) in older patients with hypertension. A lower risk of new LV hypertrophy development and greater regression of LV mass index were observed in patients with intensive treatment than in those with standard treatment. This favorable effect partially explains the reduction in cardiovascular events associated with intensive SBP lowering."

We examined socio-demographic and behavioral factors associated with breast and cervical cancer screening among Cambodian women aged 15-49 years old. We analyzed women’s data from the 2022 Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS). In total, 19,496 women were interviewed. Multiple logistic regression was performed using STATA V17 to examine factors associated with breast and cervical cancer screening. The proportion of breast and cervical cancer screenings was 10.6% and 15.3%, respectively. After being adjusted, factors independently associated with breast cancer screening included age group 20-29 years [AOR=2.51; 95% CI: 1.55-4.06], 30-39 years [AOR=4.34; 95% CI: 2.66-7.09], and 40-49 years [AOR=4.66; 95% CI: 2.81-7.71], higher education [AOR=1.92; 95% CI: 1.26-2.93], exposure media [AOR=1.66; 95% CI: 1.32-2.10], and rich wealth quintile [AOR=1.50; 95% CI: 1.25-1.80]. Similarly, the odds of having cervical cancer screening were age group 20-29 years [AOR=2.88; 95% CI: 1.76-4.71], 30-39 years [AOR=5.94; 95% CI: 3.58-9.83], and 40-49 years [AOR=7.61; 95% CI: 4.55-12.73], higher education [AOR=1.55; 95% CI: 1.55-2.73], exposure media [AOR=1.62; 95% CI: 1.35,1.95], and rich wealth quintile [AOR=2.14; 95% CI: 1.78-2.58]. In conclusion, this study shows the low screening proportion for both breast and cervical cancers, and it also highlights that socio-economic factors are significantly important in determining the health care seeking for these two main cancer screening services among women aged 15-49 years in Cambodia. Therefore, increase of exposure media with health education focusing on these cancer screenings should be made better accessible to women, particularly those of low socio-economic status."

However, LASr may be technically challenging and is not available to all clinical echocardiographers. Since LASr is a consequence of left atrial (LA) stretch during apical descent of the mitral annulus, we hypothesized that a ratio between mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) and LA volume (LAV) may offer similar diagnostic value as LASr. We aimed to investigate the relationship between MAPSE/LAV and LASr and evaluate the diagnostic performance of MAPSE/LAV to identify patients with elevated LV filling pressure.Methods MAPSE/LAV and LA strain measures were obtained in patients referred for echocardiography due to aortic stenosis, and in patients who had undergone clinically indicated right heart catheterization (RHC) with simultaneous echocardiography.Results In 93 patients with moderate aortic stenosis, MAPSE/LAV was moderately correlated with LASr (r=0.57) but was lower in patients with elevated compared to normal LV filling pressure by echocardiography (0.11 vs. 0.16 mm/mL, p<0.001). In 72 patients who had undergone RHC and simultaneous echocardiography, MAPSE/LAV and LASr correlated weakly with pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) (r=-0.44 and r=0.37). MAPSE/LAV was lower in patients with elevated (>15 mmHg) vs. normal PAWP (0.14 mm/mL vs. 0.27 mm/mL). Accuracy for detection of elevated PAWP was similar for MAPSE/LAV (area under the curve MAPSE/LAV: 0.75 [0.58–0.92] and LASr: 0.75 [0.57–0.90]).Conclusions Despite a moderate correlation with LASr, MAPSE/LAV provided similar diagnostic value as LASr regarding LV filling pressures as determined by echocardiography and RHC."

Our methods fit negative binomial distributions to transmission chain offspring distributions informed by a large mpox contact tracing dataset. We found that estimates of transmission heterogeneity varied across the outbreak, but overall estimated transmission heterogeneity was low. When testing our methods on simulated data, estimate accuracy depended on contact tracing data accuracy and completeness. Because the actual contact tracing data had high incompleteness, the values of k estimated from the empirical data may therefore be artificially high. Through simulation, we explore a method to correct estimated k for data incompleteness and, further, explore baseline expectations for temporal dynamics of k."

Here, we assessed the PrEP care continuum following PrEP rollout in a Ugandan community with ∼40% HIV seroprevalence.Methods We used cross-sectional population-based data collected between September 3 and December 19, 2018 from a Lake Victoria fishing community in southern Uganda to measure levels of self-reported PrEP knowledge, ever use, and discontinuation following 2017 PrEP rollout via a U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported phased implementation program. Our analysis included HIV-seronegative persons reporting having ever received an HIV test result. We examined associations between demographic, behavioral, and health utilization factors with each outcome using age-adjusted modified Poisson regression.Results There were 1,401 HIV-seronegative participants, of whom 1,363 (97.3%) reported ever receiving an HIV test result. Median age was 29 years (IQR: 23-36), and 42.3% (n=577) were women. Most (85.5%; n=1,166) participants reported PrEP knowledge, but few (14.5%; n=197) reported ever using PrEP. Among 375 (47.7%) men and 169 (29.3%) women PrEP-eligible at time of survey, 18.9% (n=71) and 27.8% (n=47) reported ever using PrEP, respectively. Over half (52.3%, n=103) of those who had ever used PrEP, self-reported current use.Conclusion In this Lake Victoria fishing community, there were low levels of PrEP use despite high levels of PrEP awareness and eligibility, particularly among men. Efforts that enhance awareness of HIV risk and increase PrEP accessibility may help increase PrEP use among HIV-seronegative persons in African settings with high HIV burden."

However, previous methods have primarily concentrated on single time-point images, neglecting the temporal dynamics and changes inherent in longitudinal medical images. Thus, we propose a Transformer-based longitudinal image analysis framework (LOMIA-T) to contrast and fuse latent representations from pre- and post-treatment medical images for predicting treatment response. Specifically, we first design a treatment response- based contrastive loss to enhance latent representation by discerning evolutionary processes across various disease stages. Then, we integrate latent representations from pre- and post-treatment CT images using a cross-attention mechanism. Considering the redundancy in the dual-branch output features induced by the cross-attention mechanism, we propose a clinically interpretable feature fusion strategy to predict treatment response. Experimentally, the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art longitudinal image analysis methods on an in-house Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) dataset, encompassing 170 pre- and post-treatment contrast-enhanced CT image pairs from ESCC patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Ablation experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed treatment response-based contrastive loss and feature fusion strategy. The codes will be made available at https://github.com/syc19074115/LOMIA-T."

Few studies have reported the association between COVID-19 and stroke in the hospital setting.Methods We retrospectively reviewed and characterized all patients who presented to a single, quaternary medical center between March and December 2020 (N=603). COVID-19 positive patients who developed ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were included in the analysis (N=66). This cohort was compared with patients who were COVID-19 negative at the time of stroke presentation in the same period (N=537). Statistical significance was evaluated using Pearson’s Chi squared test with Yates’ continuity correction and linear model ANOVA.Results Sixty-six patients had COVID-19 and Stroke. Of these patients, 22 (33.4%) patients initially presented with stroke and 44 (66.7%) initially presented with COVID-19. Patients who presented with COVID-19 and had a stroke during their hospitalization (COVID-first) had worse outcomes than patients presenting to the hospital with stroke whose COVID test became positive later in the hospitalization (stroke-first). Patients who presented with COVID-19 and had a stroke during their hospitalization had an increased rate of acute renal failure (48.9% vs 19.0%, p=0.021) and need for ventilation (60.0% vs 28.6%, p=0.017). Further, in the COVID-first cohort, the use of heparin prior to the stroke event was not associated with mortality or type of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic).Conclusion In the early pandemic, patients with COVID-19 infection and stroke had a higher mortality rate compared to COVID-19 negative patients with stroke. Among patients with both COVID-19 and stroke, patients presenting with COVID-19 first had worse outcomes than patients presenting with stroke first. The use of heparin prior to the stroke event was not associated with mortality or type of stroke."

Although paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) are rich in routine electronic data, highly pragmatic digital trials in this field remain scarce. There are unmet evidence needs for optimal mechanical ventilation modes in paediatric intensive care. We aim to test the feasibility of a digital PICU trial comparing two modes of invasive mechanical ventilation using carbon dioxide (CO2) control as the outcome measure.Methods and analysis Single-centre, open-labelled, randomized controlled pilot trial with two parallel treatment arms comparing pressure control (PC) vs pressure-regulated volume control (PRVC). Patients are eligible if aged <18 years, weighing >2 kg, have an arterial line, and require >60 minutes of mechanical ventilation during PICU hospitalization at the University Children’s Hospital Zurich. Exclusion criteria include cardiac shunt lesions, pulmonary hypertension under treatment, and intracranial hypertension. CO2 is measured using three methods: end-tidal (continuous), transcutaneous (continuous), and blood gas analyses (intermittent). Baseline, intervention, and outcome data are collected electronically from the patients’ routine electronic health records. The primary feasibility outcome is adherence to the assigned ventilation mode, while the primary physiological outcome is the proportion of time spent within the target range of CO2 (end-tidal, normocarbia defined as CO2 ≥ 4.5, ≤ 6 kPa). Both outcomes are captured digitally every minute from randomization until censoring (48 hours after randomization, extubation, discharge, or death, whichever comes first). Analysis will occur on an intention-to-treat basis. We aim to enrol 60 patients in total. Recruitment started in January 2024 and is planned to continue for 6 months.Ethics and dissemination This study received ethical approval (BASEC 2022-00829). Study results will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal and other media like podcasts.Trial registration number NCT058431ARTICLE SUMMARYThis study compares two commonly used modes of invasive mechanical ventilation in a randomized design. The trial will provide feasibility data to inform the conduct of digital trials by using electronic patient data directly extracted from the source systems, minimizing manual data collection and associated bias and thereby increasing local readiness for more efficient clinical trial conduct.Outcomes of this pilot trial relate to feasibility and physiological measures; future larger trials should also explore patient-centred outcomes.Blinding is not possible due to the nature of the intervention.Technical issues that may affect the availability or accuracy of data may arise and will be documented.Some aspects of digital trials, such as electronic informed consent, are not implemented in this trial."

Botulinum NeuroToxin (BoNT) injections have been proven to be an effective intervention to treat focal spasticity in Stroke, Cerebral Palsy and Multiple Sclerosis. However, to the best of our knowledge, only one systematic review published in 2015 evaluated the efficacy of BoNT in treating spasticity in patients affected by SCI.Objective We formulated the following research question: “What is known from the existing literature about the use of BoNT for treating spasticity in patients affected by SCI?”.Material and methods We will include studies focusing on using BoNT to treat spasticity in patients with SCI due to any cause. We will search the following databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and PEDro. In addition, grey literature and the reference lists of all relevant studies will be searched. Two authors will independently perform the study selection and data extraction phases. Results from the scoping review will be summarized descriptively through tables and diagrams."

Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive glioma subtype. At present, there are few well-established pre-clinical predictors for glioma incidence. Due to the availability and size of prognostic studies in glioma, we utilised a Mendelian randomization framework to identify non-causal protein biomarkers which are associated with early-onset of glioma in the European population.Methods We generated polygenic risk scores (PRS) for glioma (n=12,496), glioblastoma (n=6,191), and non-glioblastoma (n=5,819) cases. We used reverse Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine the relationship between the genetic liability of glioma and 1,463 and 90 proteins were measured using an Olink panel (UKBB, n=35,571 and SCALLOP, n=21,758), additionally 4,907 and 2,994 aptamers were assayed using SOMAscan assays (deCODE n=35,559 and INTERVAL, n=3,301). We further performed a forward cis-MR and colocalization analysis leveraging the circulating protein markers in risk of glioma, glioblastoma and non-glioblastoma.Results Reverse MR identified 161 unique proteins associated with the PRS of glioma, 79 proteins associated with the PRS of glioblastoma, and 11 proteins associated with the PRS of non-glioblastoma. Enrichment analyses identified a proportion of plasma proteins to be associated with the PRS of glioma to be correlated with response to external stimulus. A group of plasma proteins linked to the PRS of glioma and glioblastoma were related to the immune system process. Forward MR of the putative relationships were found to have little or no evidence of association on the causal pathway. Candidate markers ETFA, RIR1 and BT3A1 are evidenced in glioma risk.Conclusion Our findings identify a high genetic liability to glioma is associated with the immune system processes. Non-causal plasma biomarkers identified through PRS associations could indicate novel non-causal biomarkers of early glioma development."

This study examines ultrasomics — a novel cardiac ultrasound-based radiomics technique to extract high-throughput pixel-level information from images—for identifying infarcted myocardium.Methodology A retrospective multicenter cohort of 380 participants was split into two groups: a model development cohort (n=296; 101 MI cases, 195 controls) and an external validation cohort (n=84; 40 MI cases, 44 controls). Handcrafted and transfer learning-derived deep ultrasomics features were extracted from 2-chamber and 4-chamber echocardiographic views and ML models were built to detect patients with MI and infarcted myocardium within individual views. Myocardial infarct localization via texture features was determined using Shapley additive explanations. All the ML models were trained using 10-fold cross-validation and assessed on an external test dataset, using the area under the curve (AUC).Results The ML model, leveraging segment-level handcrafted ultrasomics features identified MI with AUCs of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.97-0.97) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74-0.89) at the patient-level and view-level, respectively. A model combining handcrafted and deep ultrasomics provided incremental information over deep ultrasomics alone (AUC: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.71-0.85 vs. 0.75, 95% CI: 0.66-0.82). Using a view-level ultrasomic model we identified texture features that effectively discriminated between infarcted and non-infarcted segments (p<0.001) and facilitated parametric visualization of infarcted myocardium.Conclusion This pilot study highlights the potential of cardiac ultrasomics in distinguishing healthy and infarcted myocardium and opens new opportunities for advancing myocardial tissue characterization using echocardiography."

Genetic tests targeting 444 pan-cardiomyopathy genes (including 36 core DCM genes) were performed, along with the collection of clinical and electrophysiological information.Results A total of 105 patients were enrolled (median age, 65.0 [57.5–75.0] years), and 33 (31%) were women. The average LVEF was 27.4 ± 5.9%, and 46 patients (44%) had ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy with ICD (34 for primary prevention and 12 for secondary prevention purpose) at the time of enrollment. Fourteen patients (13%) had pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants (comprising 6 TTN, 4 DSP, 2 TNNT2, 1 RBM20, 1 DSG and 1 MYBPC3, one patients had both DSP and RBM20), and 59 patients (56%) had P/LP/variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in the 36 core DCM genes. Twenty-eight patients (27%) harbored SCD-related gene variants (14 DSP, 11FLNC, 9 RBM20 and 2 TMEM43). The prevalence of SCD gene variants tended to be higher in the secondary prevention and non-ICD groups (33.3% for secondary purposes, 11.8% for primary purposes, and 33.8% for non-ICD; p = 0.058).Conclusions In patients with advanced heart failure and DCM, P/LP-validated DCM variants were not common in sporadic cases. However, when extended to VUS, approximately half of the patients had core DCM-related variants. The prevalence of SCD variants was not lower in the non-ICD group, thus suggesting a potential risk of fatal arrhythmia.(Trial registration: CRIS KCT0004913)"

Even though HBV infection is incurable, timely treatment is effective in preventing disease progression to liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. However, not all infected patients require treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical, immunological, and virological profiles of newly diagnosed adult HBV patients at a tertiary healthcare center in Ghana and to determine the antiviral treatment eligibility rate based on current guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO). A hospital-based cross-sectional study involving total sampling of 220 treatment naïve HBV surface antigen positive clients was carried out. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data and detailed clinical and laboratory assessment (serological, biochemical and virological) was carried out. Data were entered and analyzed with STATA version 16. The median age at diagnosis was 34 years (IQR 26.0 – 41.5) with a male to female ratio of 1:1.5. A total of 138 participants (62.7%) were diagnosed with HBV infection following voluntary testing. There was a median delay of 8.5 months (IQR 3.0 – 22.5) between initial diagnosis and patients’ presentation for medical care. In all, 24 patients (10.9%) had abnormal clinical examination findings, 172 patients (78.2%) had HBV DNA levels ≤ 2000 IU/ml while 8 (3.6%) were seropositive for HBeAg. A small proportion of patients had concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (2.7%) and hepatitis C virus (1.4%) infections. Treatment eligibility rate was very low among newly diagnosed HBV infected patients seeking medical care (n=14, 6.4%) following the WHO guidelines for treatment eligibility. Thus, increasing screening rate among the general population, early linkage to clinical care of screen positives and vaccination of screen negatives will help reduce HBV related clinical conditions in resource limited countries."

Traditionally, extracting relevant biomarkers of disease activity and neurodegeneration requires multimodal MRI protocols, limiting the use of the already existing vast amount of incomplete or single-modality MRI data which are acquired in clinical settings. We developed MindGlide, a deep learning model that extracts volums of brain regions and lesion from a single MRI modality, simplifying analysis and enabling the use of heterogeneous clinical archives. We trained MindGlide on a dataset of 4,247 brain MRI scans from 2,934 MS patients across 592 MRI scanners and validated it on 14,952 brain MRI scans from 1001 patients from three unseen external validation cohorts including 161 adolescent patients. Using dice scores, we demonstrated that MindGlide accurately estimated white matter lesion, cortical, and deep grey matter volumes. These volumes correlated with disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale, absolute correlation coefficients 0.1-0.2, p<0.05), and MindGlide outperformed an established tool in this regard. MindGlide robustly detected treatment effects across clinical trials, including disease activity and neurodegeneration (as shown by lesion accrual and brain tissue loss, respectively), even when analysing MRI modalities not traditionally used for such detailed measurements. Our results indicate the potential to indirectly reduce scan time and drug development costs in clinical trials while directly transforming the utility of retrospective analysis of real-world data acquired in clinical settings. As a consequence, scan time will be reduced and, in turn, the cost of trials."

Multivariable logistics regression analyses were applied to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Survival curves were plotted, and subgroup analyses were stratified by relevant covariates. To address the linearity relationship, curve fitting were performed.Results Of the 7,241 patients, 5,864 patients with sepsis and AF were included. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 21.1% (1,235/4,629). Adjusted for confounding factors in the multivariable logistics regression analysis models, when NLR was used as a categorical variable, patients in the highest NLR tertile had increased in-hospital mortality compared to patients in the lowest NLR tertile (HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.09–1.58). A linear relationship between NLR and in-hospital mortality was found in patients with sepsis and AF. K-M curves showed the in-hospital mortality rate was highest in group 3(NLRL8.4) than in the other two groups. Stratified analyses indicated that the correlation between the NLR and in-hospital mortality was stable.Conclusion There is a linear relationship between NLR and in-hospital mortality in intensive care of septic patients with atrial fibrillation. A higher NLR in ICU patients is associated with in-hospital mortality in the United States. However, further research is needed to confirm the findings."

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of LV unloading with an Impella versus IABP on in-hospital mortality and other clinical outcomes.Methods Using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database from September 28, 2016, to March 31, 2022, we identified inpatients who received an Impella or IABP in combination with ECMO (ECPella or ECMO+IABP group, respectively). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, length of ECMO, total hospitalization cost, and complications. Propensity score matching was performed to compare the outcomes between the groups.Results Of 14,525 eligible patients, 603 (4.2%) received ECPella and 13,922 (96%) received ECMO+IABP. After propensity score matching, there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the two groups (58.9% versus 56.6%; risk difference, 2.3%; 95% confidence interval, −3.9% to 8.5%). The ECPella group had a longer hospital stay, higher total hospitalization cost, and more frequent major bleeding, vascular complications, and renal replacement therapy during hospitalization than the ECMO+IABP group.Conclusions This nationwide inpatient database study showed that ECPella was not associated with a survival benefit but was associated with a longer hospital stay, higher total hospitalization cost, and more complications than ECMO+IABP."

A device to measure postural control would facilitate evidence-based fall risk assessment.Objectives Our objectives were to iteratively develop a prototype quantitative posture instrument (QuPI) to replace the weight scale and to assess barriers and facilitators of its implementation in a clinical setting.Methods We undertook a formative evaluation and usability study of two QuPI prototypes in primary care, medical oncology, sports medicine, cardiology, and endocrinology outpatient clinics. Clinicians evaluated an initial QuPI prototype and completed a semi-structured interview to determine critical functionality, inform design, and assess usability. The QuPI was modified according to the results, and a new prototype was tested and evaluated.Results Eighteen clinicians participated in both rounds of interviews. Clinicians who participated (referred to as participants) reported willingness to use the QuPI with all patients during the first round of interviews and stated they would replace their current weight scale with the modified QuPI during the second round of interviews. Participants identified design elements that were both facilitators and barriers to use. Usability scores for both prototypes were excellent. Despite several national guidelines for fall risk assessments, lack of consistent use of guidelines by care teams was found to be a barrier to effective fall risk assessments.Conclusion The QuPI provides a new method for quantifying fall risks with good user acceptance, usability, and clinical feasibility without disrupting workflow. The QuPI supplemented and facilitated the use of standard algorithms for fall risk assessment. Greater education of the entire care team regarding evidence-based fall risk assessment will promote adherence to guidelines and fall prevention."

We examined the cost-effectiveness (CE) of EoT in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has the highest global gHAT burden. In 166 health zones (HZs), we modelled the transmission dynamics, health outcomes, and economic costs of six strategies during 2024-40, including the cessation of activities after case reporting reduces to zero. Uncertainty in CE was assessed within the net monetary framework, presented as the optimal strategies at a range of willingness-to-pay (WTP) values, denominated in costs per disability-adjusted life-year averted. Status quo strategies, CE strategies (WTP=$500), and strategies with a high probability of EoT by 2030 are predicted to yield EoT by 2030 in 117 HZs, 130 HZs, and 138 HZs respectively, at a cost by 2040 of $159M (82M–266M), $175M ($98M–$285M), $206M ($114M–$339M). A more lenient timeline of EoT by 2040 could lead to EoT in 153 HZs at a cost of $189M ($105M–$311M), leaving 13 HZs shy of the goal. Investing in EoT by 2030 is predicted to reduce gHAT deaths from 34,770 (14,113–71,118) with status quo strategies to 8,214 (3,284–18,507)."

This limits their applicability to rare cardiac diseases like Brugada syndrome (BrS), often lacking accurately labeled ECG examples. To address labeled data constraints and the resulting limitations of supervised training approaches, we developed a novel deep learning model for BrS ECG classification using the Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) architecture for self-supervised pre-training. The VICReg model outperformed a state-of-the-art neural network in all calculated metrics, achieving an area under the receiver operating and precision-recall curves of 0.88 and 0.82, respectively. We used the VICReg model to identify missed BrS cases and hence refine the previously underestimated institutional BrS prevalence and patient outcomes. Our results provide a novel approach to rare cardiac disease identification and challenge existing BrS prevalence estimates offering a framework for other rare cardiac conditions."

Early detection and risk stratification are crucial for timely intervention and improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to identify predisposing genetic, phenotypic, and exposure-related factors for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using multi-modal data and assess their joint predictive potential.Methods Utilizing data from the UK Biobank, we analyzed an unrelated set of 292 ALS cases and 408,831 controls of European descent. Two polygenic risk scores (PRS) are constructed: “GWAS Hits PRS” and “PRS-CS,” reflecting oligogenic and polygenic ALS risk profiles, respectively. Time-restricted phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) were performed to identify pre-existing conditions increasing ALS risk, integrated into phenotypic risk scores (PheRS). A poly-exposure score (“PXS”) captures the influence of environmental exposures measured through survey questionnaires. We evaluate the performance of these scores for predicting ALS incidence and stratifying risk, adjusting for baseline demographic covariates.Results Both PRSs modestly predicted ALS diagnosis, but with increased predictive power when combined (covariate-adjusted receiver operating characteristic [AAUC] = 0.584 [0.525, 0.639]). PheRS incorporated diagnoses 1 year before ALS onset (PheRS1) modestly discriminated cases from controls (AAUC = 0.515 [0.472, 0.564]). The “PXS” did not significantly predict ALS. However, a model incorporating PRSs and PheRS1 improved prediction of ALS (AAUC = 0.604 [0.547, 0.667]), outperforming a model combining all risk scores. This combined risk score identified the top 10% of risk score distribution with a 4-fold higher ALS risk (95% CI: [2.04, 7.73]) versus those in the 40%-60% range.Discussions By leveraging UK Biobank data, our study uncovers predisposing ALS factors, highlighting the improved effectiveness of multi-factorial prediction models to identify individuals at highest risk for ALS."

This study aims to quantify the economic impact of missed billing opportunities for tobacco cessation in a healthcare system, thereby assessing potential revenue loss and evaluating the effectiveness of systems-based approaches in enhancing tobacco cessation efforts.Methods A retrospective cohort study utilized aggregated de-identified patient health data from an 8-hospital regional health system across Pennsylvania and Maryland, spanning from 1/1/21 to 12/31/23. The analysis focused on primary care encounters eligible for smoking cessation counseling (CPT codes 99406 or 99407), with potential revenue calculated based on the Medicare reimbursement rate.Results Among 584,631 primary care patients, 75,115 were identified as smokers. Over three years, only 1,277 of encounters with smokers were billed for cessation services, representing a billing rate of 1.7%. The estimated potential revenue loss from eligible encounters totaled $5,947,018.13, with an average loss of $1,982,339.38 annual.Conclusions The study reveals a significant gap between the potential and actual billing for tobacco cessation services, highlighting not only the financial implications of missed opportunities but the validation of health system’s public health impact. Underbilling contributes to considerable annual revenue loss and undermines primary prevention efforts against tobacco-related diseases. Our findings illuminate the need for enhanced billing practices and systemic changes, including policy improvements that influence proper billing to promote public health benefits through improved smoking cessation interventions."

However, the insufficiency of seizure data poses the challenge of elucidating the network mechanisms behind the frequent and recurrent abnormal discharges. Our study of two extensive intracranial EEG datasets revealed that the seizure onset zone exhibits recurrent synchronous activation of interictal events. These synchronized discharges formed repetitive sequential patterns, indicative of a stable and intricate network structure within the seizure onset zone (SOZ). We hypothesized that the frequent replay of interictal sequential activity shapes the structure of the epileptic network, which in turn supports the occurrence of these discharges. The Hopfield-Kuramoto oscillator network model was employed to characterize the formation and evolution of the epileptic network, encoding the interictal sequential patterns into the network structure using the Hebbian rule. This model successfully replicated patient-specific interictal sequential activity. Dynamic change of the network connections was further introduced to build an adaptive Kuramoto model to simulate the interictal to ictal transition. The Kuramoto oscillator network with adaptive connections (KONWAC) model we proposed essentially combines two scales of Hebbian plasticity, shaping both the stereotyped propagation and the ictal transition in epileptic networks through the interplay of regularity and uncertainty in interictal discharges."

Proteome-wide association study (PWAS) integrating proteomics data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data was shown as a powerful tool for detecting risk genes. The identified PWAS risk genes can be interpretated as having genetic effects mediated through the genetically regulated protein abundances. Existing PWAS analyses of AD often rely on the availability of individual-level proteomics and genetics data of a reference cohort. Leveraging summary-level protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) reference data of multiple relevant tissues is expected to improve PWAS findings for studying AD.Here, we applied our recently developed OTTERS tool to conduct PWAS of AD dementia, by leveraging summary-level pQTL data of brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma tissues, and multiple statistical methods. For each target protein, imputation models of the protein abundance with genetic predictors were trained from summary-level pQTL data, estimating a set of pQTL weights for considered genetic predictors. PWAS p-values were obtained by integrating GWAS summary data of AD dementia with estimated pQTL weights. PWAS p-values from multiple statistical methods were combined by the aggregated Cauchy association test to yield one omnibus PWAS p-value for the target protein. We identified significant PWAS risk genes through omnibus PWAS p-values and analyzed their protein-protein interactions using STRING. Their potential causal effects were assessed by the probabilistic Mendelian randomization (PMR-Egger).As a result, we identified a total of 23 significant PWAS risk genes for AD dementia in brain, CSF, and plasma tissues, including 7 novel findings. We showed that 15 of these risk genes were interconnected within a protein-protein interaction network involving the well-known AD risk gene of APOE and 5 novel findings, and enriched in immune functions and lipids pathways including positive regulation of immune system process, positive regulation of macrophage proliferation, humoral immune response, and high-density lipoprotein particle clearance. Existing biological evidence was found to relate our novel findings with AD. We validated the mediated causal effects of 14 risk genes (60.8%).In conclusion, we identified both known and novel PWAS risk genes, providing novel insights into the genetic mechanisms in brain, CSF, and plasma tissues, and targeted therapeutics development of AD dementia. Our study also demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating public available summary-level pQTL data with GWAS summary data for mapping risk genes of complex human diseases."

Part of the difficulty in containing cholera comes from our lack of understanding of how it circulates throughout the region. To better characterize regional transmission, we generated and analyzed 118 Vibrio cholerae genomes collected between 2007-2019 from five different countries in Southern and Eastern Africa. We showed that V. cholerae sequencing can be successful from a variety of sample types and filled in spatial and temporal gaps in our understanding of circulating lineages, including providing some of the first sequences from the 2018-2019 outbreaks in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, and Malawi. Our results present a complex picture of cholera transmission in the region, with multiple lineages found to be co-circulating within several countries. We also find evidence that previously identified sporadic cases may be from larger, undersampled outbreaks, highlighting the need for careful examination of sampling biases and underscoring the need for continued and expanded cholera surveillance across the African continent."

In this regard, digital dementia-preventive lifestyle services (DDLS) emerge as potentially pivotal services, aiming to address modifiable risk factors on a large scale. This study aims to identify the top-funded companies offering DDLS globally and evaluate their clinical evidence to gain insights into the current state of the global service landscape.Methods A systematic screening of two financial databases (Pitchbook and Crunchbase) was conducted. Corresponding published clinical evidence was collected through a systematic literature review and analyzed regarding study purpose, results, quality of results, and level of clinical evidence.Findings The ten top-funded companies offering DDLS received a total funding of EUR 128.52 million, of which three companies collected more than 75%. Clinical evidence was limited due to only nine eligible publications, small clinical subject groups, the absence of longitudinal study designs, and no direct evidence of dementia prevention.Conclusion The study highlights the need for a more rigorous evaluation of DDLS effectiveness in today’s market. It serves as a starting point for further research in digital dementia prevention."

We investigated the potential of cardiac ultrasound radiomics (ultrasomics) to identify obstructive CAD using limited echocardiography frames, suitable for cardiac point-of-care ultrasound evaluation.Methods In total, 333 patients who were either healthy controls (n=30), undergoing invasive coronary procedures (n=113), or coronary CT angiography (n=190) were divided into two temporally distinct training (n=271) and testing (n=62) cohorts. Machine learning models were developed using ultrasomics for predicting severe CAD (stenosis >70%) and compared with regional LV wall motion abnormalities (RWMA).Results In total, 94 (28.2%) patients had severe CAD with 50 (15.0%) having high-risk CAD defined as left main stenosis >50% (n=11), multivessel CAD (n=43), or 100% occlusion (n=20). The ultrasomics model was superior to RWMA for predicting severe CAD [area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74 to 0.86) vs. 0.67 (95% CI: 0.61-0.72), p=0.0014] in the training set and [0.77 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) vs. 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56-0.81), p=0.24] in the test set, respectively. The model also predicted high-risk CAD with an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.77-0.90) in the training set and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.48-0.88) in the test set. A combination of ultrasomics with RWMA showed incremental value over RWMA alone for predicting severe CAD.Conclusions Cardiac ultrasomic features extracted from limited echocardiography views can aid the development of machine learning models to predict the presence of severe obstructive CAD."

The clinical benefits of staged transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) post-TAVR remain underexplored. This study aimed to investigate clinical outcomes of staged TEER for residual significant MR post-TAVR.Methods This observational study included 314 consecutive patients with chronic residual grade 3+ or 4+ MR at 30 days follow-up post-TAVR, with 104 (33.1%) treated with staged TEER (TEER group) and 210 (66.9%) with medical therapy alone (MT group). The primary composite outcomes were all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalization at 2 years. Additional analysis, including changes in MR grade and the New York Association (NYHA) functional classification, and subgroup outcome comparisons based on MR etiology were also conducted.Results The rate of primary composite outcome was lower in the TEER group than that in the MT group (33.7% vs. 48.1%, p = 0.015). Significant improvement in MR grade and NYHA class was observed in the TEER group after 2 years. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that, among patients with degenerative MR, a lower incidence of composite outcome and HF hospitalization was observed in the TEER group (hazard ratio: 0.35; 95% confidence interval: 0.23–0.53, p < 0.001).Conclusions Staged TEER post-TAVR was associated with reduced MR and improved clinical outcomes. The clinical significance of MR post-TAVR should be carefully evaluated, and TEER should be considered for patients with significant residual MR, particularly those with degenerative MR.What is Known
Moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (MR) often accompanies severe aortic stenosis (AS).Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is effective for high- or intermediate-risk patients with severe AS.Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) has shown clinical efficacy for significant MR in high-surgical risk patients.Although TAVR can reduce pre-existing MR, significant residual MR is still observed post-TAVR and is associated with adverse cardiac events.What the Study Adds:
This study systematically evaluates the clinical outcomes of TEER for residual significant MR post-TAVR.TEER following TAVR is associated with better clinical outcomes than medical therapy alone, with the TEER group having fewer primary composite events of all-cause mortality and heart failure rehospitalization as well as improved functional status.Subgroup analyses based on MR etiology suggest that staged TEER is particularly beneficial in patients with degenerative MR.The study highlights the importance of re-evaluating residual MR after TAVR to determine the most effective treatment strategy, emphasizing the potential benefits of staged TEER in improving outcomes for high-risk patients."

MI entails mentally rehearsing motor actions without physically executing them. This cognitive process has garnered attention due to its potential benefits in aiding motor function recovery in PD patients. Its role in complementing traditional treatment approaches is likely to reverberate throughout clinical practice. This study strives to provide a comprehensive examination several MI protocols designed for individuals with PD. The focus was to underscore the outcomes observed across motor symptoms, balance, gait, and quality of life.Methods A literature search was carried out in the following databases: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and PEDro, from the first publication to February 2024. Study with at least one keyword in relation to PD and MI in the title were included.Results Of the 262 studies 53 were included. Twelve RCTs with a mean PEDro score of 6.6/10 and 41 descriptive and non-RCT studies. Among the RCTs, there were almost exclusively MI on balance, gait, and lower limbs exercise. They found an 85.2% improvement for the experimental group on the TUG with a cognitive task (p<0.02), 5.8% on the TUG (p<0.05), a 5.1% improvement in walking speed (p<0.05), other variables did not show significant improvement. For the descriptive and non-RCTs studies, there were various tasks and outcomes for the lower and upper limbs. It was shown that there was no difference in execution time in MI between patients with PD and HS, while in ME patients with PD were slower. For the upper limb, several tasks were proposed, such as thumb opposition, joystick movements and writing tasks with variable results. RCTs were more focused on balance, lower limb and walking, there was no specific outcome for the upper limb and speech. The heterogeneity of the tasks and outcomes across all included studies is also a limitation.Conclusion To summarize, the current research on walking disorders in PD shows promise, but further investigations are crucial, particularly with an emphasis on upper limb function and speech. A need exists for studies with larger sample sizes, utilizing precise methodologies, and specifically targeting these areas to enhance our comprehension of the potential advantages of MI in the context of comprehensive PD rehabilitation."

This study describes the barriers to immunization in six states in Northeast and Northwest Nigeria, which have the lowest vaccination coverage rates in the country.Method The socioecological framework informed the design of focus group discussions that we conducted with 93 caregivers and 91 community influencers from March to July 2022 to understand their perceptions of the barriers to immunization uptake. We thematically analyzed data that were inductively and deductively coded in NVivo version 12 software.Results Supply-side service delivery challenges were the main systems-level barriers to vaccine uptake. These included poor provider attitude, shortage of health workers, vaccine stock-out, long wait-times, and inequitable service delivery. Other barriers were, rumors, misconceptions, vaccine distrust, socio-cultural and religious norms at the community level, and spousal and family disapproval at the interpersonal level. Limited autonomy and mobility, poor vaccine knowledge and awareness of immunization benefits, and concerns about side effects were important individual-level barriers.Conclusion Strategies for improving immunization uptake should include intensifying community sensitization, improving the numbers and quality of the health workforce, involving men and traditional institutions through context-appropriate channels, and addressing socio-cultural norms and concerns about adverse events after immunization"

Limited studies have explored compliance with infection prevention and control (IPC) practices among Somali healthcare workers. This study aimed to determine compliance with IPC practices among healthcare workers in De Martino Public Hospital, Somalia.Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at De Martino Public Hospital, Mogadishu, Somalia from August to October 2022, with the participation of 204 healthcare workers (response rate = %97). Compliance was assessed using responses to 25 questions on a five-point Likert-type scale, and the median score of 20 was used to dichotomize compliance scores. A chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were performed to check the associations between healthcare workers’ sociodemographic information, related factors to IPC, work conditions and practices on COVID-19, and IPC compliance during healthcare interventions using SPSS 23 version.Results In total, 58.3% of the participants had good compliance with IPC. There were significant associations between IPC compliance and the type of healthcare worker (doctors and doctor assistants: 72.3%, nurses and paramedical staff: 67.3%, non-clinical staff: 5.7%, p<0.01). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, compared to non-clinical staff, doctors and doctor assistants (OR: 12.11, 95% CI: 2.23-65.84) nurses and paramedical staff (OR: 21.38, 95% CI: 4.23 - 108.01) had higher compliance with infection prevention and control measures. There were no significant associations between compliance and gender, marital status, vaccination status, or smoking (p>0.05 for all).Conclusions Inadequate compliance with COVID-19 IPC measures was observed among hospital workers. Prioritizing awareness campaigns and behavior change interventions, especially among non-clinical staff, is crucial for effective COVID-19 infection prevention and control within the hospital."

Moreover, there is a considerable degree of variability in the individual response to exercise-based lifestyle interventions that remains to be explained. We aimed to identify novel exercise-induced metabolites that could mediate the improvement in glycemic control and reduction of obesity and contribute to individual differences in the response to exercise interventions.Methods We studied acute exercise- and training-induced changes in plasma metabolites in sedentary subjects with overweight (8 male, 14 female) participating in an eight-week supervised training program flanked by two acute endurance exercise sessions. Plasma metabolites were quantified using LC- and CE-MS. In a separate study (n=9 lean males), we assessed metabolite fluxes over the leg using arterial and venous catheters. Functional analyses were performed in primary blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the saturated fatty acid palmitate.Results The amino acid breakdown products 3-phenyllactic acid (PLA), 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid and indolelactic acid were increased after both acute exercise and training. All three aromatic lactic acids, which so far mainly received attention as bacterial metabolites, exhibited an efflux from the leg. PLA showed the largest increase after both acute exercise and training, of 57% and 20% respectively. The magnitude of the acute exercise-induced increase in PLA correlated with a decrease in subcutaneous adipose tissue volume and an improvement in insulin sensitivity over the course of the intervention. Furthermore, both isomers, D- and L-PLA, counteracted inflammatory cytokine production in PBMCs.Conclusions/interpretation Our findings indicate that PLA is physiologically released from skeletal muscle and can contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise as well as to individual difference in the response to lifestyle interventions in humans. PLA and potentially, aromatic lactic acids in general may be particularly relevant metabolic regulators because they can be produced both endogenously and by the microbiome.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03151590"

Patients underwent interviews and urine drug screening for cannabis and cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, in each trimester. The primary outcome was small for gestational age (SGA) at delivery. Secondary outcomes included antenatal and postpartum complications, mode of delivery, and neonatal outcomes. Secondary analyses included stratification by intensity of cannabis use and urinary cotinine positivity.RESULTS Birthing persons with PCU differed in age (25.5 vs 27.8 years, p=0.001), body mass index (BMI; 27.4 vs 30.9, p=0.001), area deprivation index percentiles (92% PCU vs 88%, p=0.013), cotinine positivity (42.8% vs 10.8%, p<0.001), Hispanic ethnicity (2% vs 7.2%, p=0.009), and education attainment beyond high school (29.4% vs 50%, p<0.001) compared to controls. Birthing person outcomes did not differ. Risks of SGA and other neonatal outcomes did not differ when adjusted for confounders on initial analysis, or with stratification by intensity of cannabis use. Despite negative self-report for nicotine, 42.8% of PCU patients tested positive for cotinine (PCU+c). PCU+c was associated with increased risk of SGA and birthweight less than the 5th percentile, compared to PCU cases without nicotine exposure (17.4% vs 8.3%, aRR 2.7 [1.21-5.38], 35.8% vs 18.6%, aRR 2.4 [1.51-3.48]), and controls (35.8% vs 12.9%, aRR 2.75 [1.64-4.13]). Cotinine-negative PCU patients and controls did not differ.CONCLUSION PCU was not independently associated with adverse birthing person outcomes. Many patients demonstrated nicotine exposure, either via inadvertent exposure or undisclosed use. While neonates exposed to cannabis alone did not differ from unexposed neonates, those exposed to both cannabis and nicotine were at increased risk of SGA."

However, concerns about accuracy, completeness, and EHRs being primarily designed for billing and administration raise questions about the consistency and reproducibility of EHR-based multimorbidity research.Methods Utilizing phecodes to represent the disease phenome, we analyzed pairwise comorbidity strengths using a dual logistic regression approach and constructed multimorbidity as an undirected weighted graph. We assessed the consistency of the multimorbidity networks within and between two major EHR systems at local (nodes and edges), meso (neighboring patterns), and global (network statistics) scales. We present case studies to identify disease clusters and uncover clinically interpretable disease relationships. We provide an interactive web tool and a knowledge base combing data from multiple sources for online multimorbidity analysis.Findings Analyzing data from 500,000 patients across Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Mass General Brigham health systems, we observed a strong correlation in disease frequencies ( Kendall’s ι− = 0.643) and comorbidity strengths (Pearson π = 0.79). Consistent network statistics across EHRs suggest a similar structure of multimorbidity networks at various scales. Comorbidity strengths and similarities of multimorbidity connection patterns align with the disease genetic correlations. Graph-theoretic analyses revealed a consistent core-periphery structure, implying efficient network clustering through threshold graph construction. Using hydronephrosis as a case study, we demonstrated the network’s ability to uncover clinically relevant disease relationships and provide novel insights.Interpretation Our findings demonstrate the robustness of large-scale EHR data for studying complex disease interactions. The alignment of multimorbidity patterns with genetic data suggests the potential utility for uncovering shared etiology of diseases. The consistent core-periphery network structure offers a strategic approach to analyze disease clusters.

All eleven hospitals were invited to participate between November 2020 and April 2021.Findings The survey was filled together with each hospital. All hospitals installed isolation precautions for patients with CPE and CPPA during inpatient care and day admissions, whereas ten hospitals (90.9%) applied isolation precautions for patients with ESBL-E. Gloves and gowns were always used during physical contact with the patient in isolation. Large variations were identified in IPC measures for visitors, cleaning and disinfection products used, and precautions during outpatient care. Four hospitals (36.4%) actively followed up on CPE or CPPA patients with the aim to declare them CPE- or CPPA-negative as timely as possible, and two hospitals (20.0%) actively followed up on ESBL-E patients.Conclusion CP are interpreted differently between hospitals, leading to regional differences in IPC measures applied in clinical settings. Harmonizing infection-control policies between the hospitals could facilitate patient transfers and benefit collective efforts of preventing transmission of MDR-GNB."

These complex processes may have common characteristics among various diseases, thereby suggesting the potential of drug repurposing. Employing Mendelian Randomization (MR), we constructed a causal network between 2,478 targetable drug-gene expressions (eQTLs) and 30 broadly reported metabolic disorders. Our study identified 499 drug target genes significantly associated with 27 metabolic disorders (|MR coefficient| > 0.2). Pathway enrichment analysis of drug target genes indicates that regulation of response stimulus may serve as a common pathway across 14 diseases. Based on 53 commonly used clinical drugs for 18 diseases, we elucidated novel therapeutic mechanisms of some drugs, such as the potential of Valproic Acid to treat Schizophrenia by affecting key genes in Alcoholism, SLC29A1, and HDAC4. Furthermore, we identified potential for drug repurposing in four diseases, with Manic Episode and Type 1 Diabetes sharing four novel drugs: Cannabidiol, Doxorubicin, Genistein, and Propylthiouracil. Additionally, we predicted 189 potential therapeutic drugs affecting the causal genes of diseases. Overall, we established a causal network between metabolic disorders and drug target genes, explored possible pathways for drug action on disease treatment, and proposed drug repurposing strategies for four diseases.HighlightsTo the best of our understanding, the manuscript we have submitted delineates the inaugural drug-gene causal network tailored for Metabolic Disorders (MDs), covering an array of 30 diseases.This investigation unveils potential novel drug mechanisms aimed at treating MDs, marking a pioneering exploration in this domain.We introduce strategies for the repurposing of drugs targeting four specific MDs, suggesting innovative approaches to treatment.The findings are presented through an easily navigable web interface, enabling thorough examination by users (https://quantlifebits.shinyapps.io/mrmetabopharm/)."

Specially designed pharmacogenomic studies have identified a handful of individual mutations modulating the effect of specific drugs. However, the extent to which drug response variability is driven by genetics is largely unknown, partly due to the small sample sizes of prospective pharmacogenomic trials. In this work, we develop a framework to study the genetic architecture of response to commonly prescribed drugs in large biobanks coupled with electronic health records. Our framework leverages concepts from gene-environment interaction testing, including novel interaction models at the level of genes, polygenic scores (PGS), and genome-wide heritability. We quantified the heritability of response to statins, metformin, warfarin, and methotrexate in 342,257 UK Biobank participants. Our results show that genetic variation modifies the primary effect of statins on LDL cholesterol (9% heritable) as well as its side effects on hemoglobin A1c and blood glucose (10% and 11% heritable, respectively). Next, we identified dozens of specific genes that modify drug response, which we then replicated in a retrospective pharmacogenomic study. Finally, we found that PGS accuracy varies up to 2-fold depending on treatment status, showing that the current approach of building PGS using mostly healthy individuals is likely to underperform in clinical contexts. Together, our results provide a framework for characterizing the genetic architecture of drug response using cross-sectional data."

Recent publications encompassing six cases have expanded the spectrum of RARA partners to torque teno mini virus (TTMV). This entity is likely under-recognized due to lack of clinician and pathologist familiarity, inability to detect the fusion using routine testing modalities, and informatic challenges in its recognition within next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. We describe a clinicopathologic approach and provide necessary tools to screen and diagnose APL with TTMV::RARA using existing clinical DNA or RNA-based NGS assays, which led to identification of four cases, all without other known cytogenetic/molecular drivers. One was identified prospectively and three retrospectively, including two from custom automated screening of multiple data sets (50,257 cases of hematopoietic malignancy, including 4809 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myeloid sarcoma/APL cases). Two cases presented as myeloid sarcoma, including one with multiple relapses after AML-type chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Two cases presented as leukemia, had a poor response to induction chemotherapy, but achieved remission upon re-induction (including all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in one case) and subsequent HSCT. Neoplastic cells demonstrated features of APL including frequent azurophilic granules and dim/absent CD34 and HLA-DR expression. RARA rearrangement was not detected by karyotype or FISH. Custom analysis of NGS fusion panel data identified TTMV::RARA rearrangements, and in the prospectively identified case, facilitated monitoring in sequential bone marrow samples. APL with TTMV::RARA is a rare leukemia with a high rate of treatment failure in described cases. The diagnosis should be considered in leukemias with features of APL that lack detectable RARA fusions and other drivers, and may be confirmed by appropriate NGS tests with custom informatics. Incorporation of ATRA may have a role in treatment but requires accurate recognition of the fusion for appropriate classification as APL."

Women were asked to retest between 36 weeks gestation and 1 week post-delivery if the last HIV test was <24 weeks gestation or at 6 weeks postpartum if ≥24 weeks gestation, and self-report on retesting at a 14 week postpartum.Results Overall, 994 women enrolled and 33% (n=330) selected HB-HIVST. HB-HIVST was selected because it was private (68%), convenient (63%), and offered flexibility in timing of retesting (63%), whereas CB-RDT was selected due to trust of providers to administer the test (77%) and convenience of clinic testing (64%). Among 905 women who reported retesting at follow-up, 135 (15%) used HB-HIVST. Most (94%) who selected CB-RDT retested with this strategy, compared to 39% who selected HB-HIVST retesting with HB-HIVST. HB-HIVST retesting was more common among women with higher household income and those who may have been unable to test during pregnancy (both retested postpartum and delivered <37 weeks gestation) and less common among women who were depressed. Most women said they would retest in the future using the test selected at enrollment (99% HB-HIVST; 93% CB-RDT-RDT).Conclusions While most women preferred CB-RDT for maternal retesting, HB-HIVST was acceptable and feasible and may increase retesting coverage and partner testing."

Despite this critical importance, research on language is limited by the lack of a scalable phenotyping toolkit.Methods Here, we describe and showcase Lingo – a flexible online battery of language and nonverbal reasoning skills based on seven widely used tasks (COWAT, picture narration, vocal rhythm entrainment, rapid automatized naming, following directions, sentence repetition, and nonverbal reasoning). The current version of Lingo takes approximately 30 minutes to complete, is entirely open source, and allows for a wide variety of performance metrics to be extracted. We asked > 1,300 individuals from multiple samples to complete Lingo, then investigated the validity and utility of the resulting data.Results We conducted an exploratory factor analysis across 14 features derived from the seven assessments, identifying five factors. Four of the five factors showed acceptable test-retest reliability (Pearson’s R > 0.7). Factor 2 showed the highest reliability (Pearson’s R = 0.95) and loaded primarily on sentence repetition task performance. We validated Lingo with objective measures of language ability by comparing performance to gold-standard assessments: CELF-5 and the VABS-3. Factor 2 was significantly associated with the CELF-5 “core language ability” scale (Pearson’s R = 0.77, p-value < 0.05) and the VABS-3 “communication” scale (Pearson’s R = 0.74, p-value < 0.05). Factor 2 was positively associated with phenotypic and genetic measures of socieconomic status. Interestingly, we found the parents of children with language impairments had lower Factor 2 scores (p-value < 0.01). Finally, we found Lingo factor scores were significantly predictive of numerous psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions.Conclusions Together, these analyses support Lingo as a powerful platform for scalable deep phenotyping of language and other cognitive abilities. Additionally, exploratory analyses provide supporting evidence for the heritability of language ability and the complex relationship between mental health and language."

Despite clinical and immunohistochemical features highly suggestive of COL6-RD, some patients had remained without an identified causative variant in COL6A1, COL6A2 or COL6A3. With combined muscle RNA-sequencing and whole-genome sequencing we uncovered a recurrent, de novo deep intronic variant in intron 11 of COL6A1 (c.930+189C>T) that leads to a dominantly acting in-frame pseudoexon insertion. We subsequently identified and have characterised an international cohort of forty-four patients with this COL6A1 intron 11 causative variant, one of the most common recurrent causative variants in the collagen VI genes. Patients manifest a consistently severe phenotype characterised by a paucity of early symptoms followed by an accelerated progression to a severe form of UCMD, except for one patient with somatic mosaicism for this COL6A1 intron 11 variant who manifests a milder phenotype consistent with Bethlem muscular dystrophy. Characterisation of this individual provides a robust validation for the development of our pseudoexon skipping therapy. We have previously shown that splice-modulating antisense oligomers applied in vitro effectively decreased the abundance of the mutant pseudoexon-containing COL6A1 transcripts to levels comparable to the in vivo scenario of the somatic mosaicism shown here, indicating that this therapeutic approach carries significant translational promise for ameliorating the severe form of UCMD caused by this common recurrent COL6A1 causative variant to a Bethlem muscular dystrophy phenotype."

It is diagnosed with a triad of hyperglycemia, ketonemia and metabolic acidosis.Objectives To describe the precipitating factors, clinical presentation and outcomes of DKA among patients attending Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH).Methods This prospective study involved 120 consecutively recruited participants diagnosed with DKA. Participants were drawn from the Emergency department and Diabetes Outpatient clinic and followed up in the wards and intensive care unit (ICU) in MTRH for up to 10 days. Focused history and physical examination was done. Blood sugar was measured daily; blood ketones and blood gases were measured on days 1,2,3 and 5. Precipitating factors, presentation and outcomes were summarised as frequencies and their corresponding percentages and presented in tables and charts.Results The median age of participants was 33 years (IQR 23, 44.5). Type 1 DM represented 63.3% and type 2 DM 34.2% of the patients. The most common precipitating factors for DKA were; new onset undiagnosed DM (37.5%), missed medication (36.7%) and infection (35.8%). The most common presentation was dehydration (97.5%) with 49.2% of the patients having severe DKA while 22.5% had mild DKA. Urine and blood ketones for diagnosis of DKA were present in 46.4% and 100% of patients respectively. The median length of hospital stay was 6 days (IQR 5,7) with infection being a significant determinant (aOR 2.63). The number of days taken for DKA to resolve ranged from 1 to 5 days with a median period of 3 days (IQR 2,3). DKA in-hospital mortality was 9.2% with new onset DM being a significant determinant (uOR 5.19).Conclusion Some of the identified DKA precipitants in the study are preventable. The impact of DKA in MTRH is notable given the significant hospital stay and mortality.Recommendation We recommend implementation research studies that would develop and test different strategies to address the precipitants to prevent DKA. For the hospital to undertake an audit of current DKA management process with the aim of improving outcomes in terms of hospital stay and mortality."

This study investigates the use of unique aSyn antibodies and an aSyn seed amplification assay (SAA) for detecting pathological aSyn in rectal biopsy samples from PD patients and healthy individuals. These samples were preserved using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) methods.Materials and Methods The study analyzed the seeding capacity of FFPE submucosal rectal biopsies from 24 PD patients and 20 healthy controls using an aSyn SAA. It examined the distribution of aSyn using immunohistochemistry with antibodies targeting specific conformations and phosphorylated forms of aSyn at S129 and Y39. Additionally, the proximity-ligation assay was employed for phosphorylated S129 aSyn.Results Pathological forms of aSyn were found in all FFPE biopsies from PD patients, as confirmed by SAA, and these were linked to the severity of motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS-III). However, the immunoreactive patterns of conformation-specific or phosphorylated aSyn in rectal biopsies did not show notable differences between PD patients and healthy subjects.Conclusion Pathological aSyn strains are detectable in FFPE rectal biopsies from PD patients with high accuracy using aSyn-SAA. However, the utility of immunohistochemical detection with current antibodies for identifying pathological aSyn forms appears limited. The findings advocate for the use of aSyn-SAA as a diagnostic tool for PD, contributing to a deeper understanding of the gut-brain connection in the disease."

The effect of centhaquine on cardiac output in patients with hypovolemic shock has not been reported.Methods Trans-thoracic echocardiography was utilized to measure stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), left ventricular outflow tract-velocity time integral (LVOT-VTI), left ventricular outflow tract diameter (LVOTd), heart rate (HR), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) and inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter before (0 min) and after centhaquine (0.01 mg/kg, iv infusion over 60 min) treatment (60 min, 120 min, and 300 min) in 12 randomly selected patients with hypovolemic shock enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, open-label phase IV clinical study (NCT05956418) of centhaquine in patients with hypovolemic shock.Results A significant increase in SV (mL) was observed after 60, 120, and 300 minutes of centhaquine treatment. CO (mL/min) increased significantly at 120 and 300 min despite a decrease in HR at these times. A significant increase in IVC diameter and LVOT-VTI (mL) at these time points was observed, which indicated increased venous return. The LVEF and FS did not change, while the mean arterial pressure (MAP, mmHg) increased in patients after 120 and 300 minutes of centhaquine treatment. Positive correlations between IVC diameter and SV (R2 = 0.9556) and between IVC diameter and MAP (R2 = 0.8928) were observed, which indicated the effect of centhaquine mediated increase in venous return on SV, CO, and MAP.Conclusions Centhaquine mediated increase in venous return appears to play a critical role in enhancing SV, CO, and MAP in patients with hypovolemic shock; these changes could be pivotal for reducing shock-mediated circulatory failure, promoting tissue perfusion, and improving patient outcomes.Trial registration The phase IV trial reported in this study has Clinical Trials Registry, India; ctri.icmr.org.in, CTRI/2021/01/030263; clinicaltrials.gov, NCT05956418."

Nonetheless, a thorough understanding of how sleep relates to these organs, as well as their genetic bases, remains elusive. Here we conducted a systematic mapping of sleep-organ connections, focusing on 623 multi-organ imaging biomarkers and 10 sleep traits. Both phenotypic and genetic analyses uncovered robust associations between sleep and the structure and function of multiple organs, such as brain functions measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and body composition traits in abdominal MRI. Sleep and imaging traits had shared genetic influences in 51 genomic loci, 23 of which had colocalized causal genetic effects. Considering the extensive genetic overlaps between sleep and multi-organ imaging biomarkers, we further described the patterns of genetic similarities between sleep and 50 diseases relevant to these organs. Notably, among all diseases examined, psychiatric disorders consistently exhibited the strongest genetic correlations and causal links with sleep. Mediation analysis further revealed that many of the identified sleep-imaging connections were mediated by intra or inter-organ diseases. Overall, our study demonstrates the broad implications of sleep on brain and body health, influenced in part by shared genetic factors."

However, emerging variants coupled with waning immunity, immunosenescence, and variability of vaccine efficacy undermine vaccine effectiveness. We therefore need to update our understanding of the immunogenicity of the most recent XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine to variant strains among NHRs.Methods The current study focuses on a subset of participants from a longitudinal study of consented NHRs and HCWs who have received serial blood draws to assess immunogenicity with each SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine dose. We report data on participants who received the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine after FDA approval in Fall 2023. NHRs were classified based on whether they had an interval SARS-CoV-2 infection between their first bivalent vaccine dose and their XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccination.Results The sample included 61 NHRs [median age 76 (IQR 68-86), 51% female] and 28 HCWs [median age 45 (IQR 31-58), 46% female). Following XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccination, there was a robust geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) in XBB.1.5-specific neutralizing antibody titers of 17.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.3, 32.4) and 11.3 (95% CI 5, 25.4) in NHRs with and without interval infection, respectively. The GMFR in HCWs was 13.6 (95% CI 8.4,22). Similarly, we noted a robust GMFR in JN.1-specific neutralizing antibody titers of 14.9 (95% CI 7.9, 28) and 6.5 (95% CI 3.3, 13.1) among NHRs with and without interval infection, and a GMFR of 11.4 (95% CI 6.2, 20.9) in HCWs. NHRs with interval SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher neutralizing antibody titers across all analyzed strains following XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccination, compared to NHRs without interval infection.Conclusion The XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine significantly elevates Omicron-specific neutralizing antibody titers to XBB.1.5 and JN.1 strains in both NHRs and HCWs. This response was more pronounced in individuals known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 since bivalent vaccination.Impact Statement All authors certify that this work entitled “Broad immunogenicity to prior strains and JN.1 variant elicited by XBB.1.5 vaccination in nursing home residents” is novel. It shows that the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine significantly elevates Omicron-specific neutralizing antibody titers in both nursing home residents and healthcare workers to XBB and BA.28.6/JN.1 strains. This work is important since JN.1 increased from less than 0.1% to 94% of COVID-19 cases from October 2023 to February 2024 in the US. This information is timely given the CDC’s latest recommendation that adults age 65 and older receive a Spring 2024 XBB booster. Since the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine produces compelling immunogenicity to the most prevalent circulating JN.1 strain in nursing home residents, our findings add important support and rationale to encourage vaccine uptake.Key PointsEmerging SARS-CoV-2 variants together with waning immunity, immunosenescence, and variable vaccine efficacy reduce SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness in nursing home residents.XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccination elicited robust response in both XBB.1.5 and JN.1 neutralizing antibodies in nursing home residents and healthcare workers, although the absolute titers to JN.1 were less than titers to XBB.1.5Why does this paper matter? Among nursing home residents, the XBB.1.5 monovalent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine produces compelling immunogenicity to the JN.1 strain, which represents 94% of all COVID-19 cases in the U.S. as of February 2024."

Here, we present clinic-based cross-sectional data on the relationship between specific HMOs in the milk of Ugandan mothers and growth in their breastfed children as a group and as males and females separately.Method Human milk samples were manually collected from 127 lactating mothers. Levels of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Children’s weight and length were measured using a portable digital scale and length board, respectively. Weight-for-age (WAZ), height-for-age (HAZ) and weight for height (WHZ) Z scores were calculated. The relationships between HMOs and untransformed weights and heights and between WAZ, HAZ and WHZ subcategories were analyzed for all children and for males and females separately by Spearman’s correlation and Kruskal‒Wallis and Mann‒Whitney U tests.Results There were positive and negative correlations between the concentrations of specific HMOs and the heights and weights of children according to mothers’ secretor status. Tall infant stature was associated with higher concentrations of 6’SL, LSTc, DFLNH, DSLNH, LNnT and total HMOs in secretor or nonsecretor mothers; short infant stature was associated with higher concentrations of 3FL and DFLac; overweight was associated with higher concentrations of 6’SL, LSTc and LNnT in secretor and nonsecretor mothers; and normal weight was associated with higher concentrations of 3’FL. The associations between maternal HMO levels and childrens heights and weights or between the LAZ, WAZ and WHZ subcategories significantly differed between male and female children.Conclusions There are sex differences in the associations between high concentrations of some HMOs and stature and weight in Ugandan children born to secretor and nonsecretor mothers.HighlightsThis study showed that some HMOs are associated with child growth metrics in a sex-specific pattern.Four HMOs (3FL, DSLNT, DFLac, and 3’SL) were positively correlated with the height/length of the children.There were significant positive correlations between height/length and 3FL and DSLNT in only female children and between height/length and DFLac in only male children.DSLNT, DFLac and LSTb were positively correlated with weight in female and male children respectively.Plain Language Summary Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been associated with growth parameters of children in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Only two such studies have been conducted in Africa. None of the studies investigated the relationship between child sex and HMO composition and growth interactions. We examined the relationship between 19 well-characterized HMOs and growth metrics and also dissected the data by infant sex. Our results show a positive correlation between some HMOs and growth indices in either female or male children only. This highlights the impact of sex differences in the relationship between specific HMOs and growth measures in children. This evidence, if validated, could inform future nutritional interventions involving combinations of HMOs as food supplements that are equally effective for both male and female children."

In this study, we investigated the predictive ability of CAC GRS for CAD.Materials and methods We investigated the association of CAC GRSs with CAD and coronary calcification among the participants in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health study (LURIC) (n=2742), the Tampere Vascular Study (TVS) (n=133), and the Tampere Sudden Death Study (TSDS) (n=660) using summary data from the largest multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis of CAC to date. Added predictive value of the CAC GRS over the traditional CVD risk factors was tested with standard train–test machine learning approach using the LURIC data, which had the largest sample size.Results CAC GRS was significantly associated with CAD in LURIC (OR=1.41, 95% CI [1.28–1.55]), TVS (OR=1.79, 95% CI [1.05–3.21]) as well as in TSDS (OR=4.20, 95% CI [1.74–10.52]). CAC GRS showed strong association with calcification areas in left (OR=1.78, 95% CI [1.16-2.74]) and right (OR=1.71, 95% CI [1.98-2.67]) coronary arteries. In addition, there was statistically significant added predictive value of the CAC GRS for CAD over the used traditional CVD risk factors (AUC 0.734 vs 0.717, p-value = 0.02).Conclusions This study showed that CAC GRS is a new risk marker for CAD in three European cohorts, with added predictive value over the traditional CVD risk factors."

This review explores the current application of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, in the field of psychiatry.Methods We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched through PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus, up until March 2024.Results From 771 retrieved articles, we included 16 that directly examine LLMs’ use in psychiatry. LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and GPT-4, showed diverse applications in clinical reasoning, social media, and education within psychiatry. They can assist in diagnosing mental health issues, managing depression, evaluating suicide risk, and supporting education in the field. However, our review also points out their limitations, such as difficulties with complex cases and potential underestimation of suicide risks.Conclusion Early research in psychiatry reveals LLMs’ versatile applications, from diagnostic support to educational roles. Given the rapid pace of advancement, future investigations are poised to explore the extent to which these models might redefine traditional roles in mental health care."

The most recent booster programme commenced in September 2023. Bivalent BA.4-5 or monovalent XBB.1.5 boosters were given. During the study period, the JN.1 variant became dominant in England.Methods Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated throughout using the test-negative case-control study design where positive PCR tests from hospitalised individuals are cases and comparable negative PCR tests are controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation with the test result as the outcome, vaccination status as the primary exposure variable of interest and confounder adjustment.Results There was no evidence of residual protection for boosters given as part of previous campaigns. There were 28,916 eligible tests included to estimate the effectiveness of the autumn 2023 boosters in those aged 65 years and older. VE peaked at 50.6% (95% CI: 44.2-56.3%) after 2-4 weeks, followed by waning to 13.6% (95% CI: -11.7-33.2%). Estimates were generally higher for the XBB.1.5 booster than the BA.4-5 booster, but this difference was not statistically significant. Point estimates were highest against XBB sub-lineages. Effectiveness was lower against both JN.1 and EG.5.1 variants with confidence intervals non-overlapping with the effectiveness of the XBB sub-lineages at 2-4 weeks for EG.5.1 where VE was 44.5% (95% CI: 20.2-61.4%) and at 5-9 weeks for JN.1 where VE was 26.4% (95%CI: -3.4-47.6%).Conclusions The recent monovalent XBB.1.5 and bivalent BA.4-5 boosters provided comparable and good protection against hospitalisation, however there was evidence of lower VE against hospitalisation of these boosters against JN.1."

As adolescents and young people are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic, this research aims to uncover how cultural and social influences shape young people’s attitudes towards dating and HIV prevention. The significance of this study lies in its potential to inform targeted, culturally sensitive HIV prevention strategies for the youth in Chad.Methods A qualitative phenomenological approach was adopted, using 4 focus group discussions (n=12 each) with high school students in N’Djamena, Chad. Participants were divided into beneficiary and non-beneficiary groups based on their exposure to a peer education program about HIV. Data analysis was conducted using ATLAS.ti software and the descriptive Colaizzi method, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of participants’ perspectives.Results Findings revealed significant gender differences in dating motivations and partner selection criteria. While males primarily viewed dating as a means to fulfill sexual desires, females often sought emotional connection and companionship. There was a general lack of awareness about PrEP, with more emphasis on condom use for pregnancy prevention rather than HIV or STI protection. Gender roles played a substantial part in decisions regarding safe sex practices, with a notable discrepancy in shared versus individual responsibility. Additionally, risk behaviors like alcohol use and multiple partnerships were identified as prevalent among youth.Conclusions The study highlights the need for gender-sensitive educational interventions focusing on the realities of adolescent sexual behavior in Chad. It underscores the disparity in HIV knowledge and prevention awareness among adolescents, pointing out the absence of awareness about PrEP.

These individuals were subjected to RMS treatment targeting one or both eyes using the VIVEYE - Ocular Magnetic Neurostimulation System Ver 1.0 (Epitech-Mag LTD; NIH clinical trials registry #NCT03012698). A placebo-controlled group was also included for comparative analysis, with all subjects being monitored over a three-month period. The evaluation of safety encompassed monitoring changes in best corrected visual acuity, ocular pathology, and reporting of adverse events. Participant tolerance was gauged through questionnaires, measurements of intraocular pressure (IOP), Schirmer’s test, and vital signs. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed by comparing pre- and post-treatment scores on fluorescein staining (according to the National Eye Institute (NEI) grading) and patient-reported outcomes.Results The study found no significant changes in visual acuity, IOP, or Schirmer’s test results between the RMS-treated and control groups (p<0.05), indicating RMS does not adversely affect these ocular functions. However, RMS treatment was associated with improved tear film stability (p=0.198 vs. p=0.045) and corneal health (p=0.52 vs. p=0.004), with no improvements in the control group. Initial symptom improvement was observed in both RMS-treated and placebo groups (p=0.007 vs p=0.008), suggesting RMS’s potential for treating ocular surface conditions.Conclusion The findings of this study introduce repetitive magnetic stimulation (RMS) as a promising therapeutic option for dry eye syndrome, demonstrating its capability to promote corneal epithelium repair, enhance tear film stability, and improve subjective symptom evaluations without adversely affecting intraocular pressure, visual acuity, or tear production. This confirms the safety and suggests the efficacy of RMS therapy for dry eye conditions."

Though the clusters of severe birth defects resulting from this outbreak have subsided, ZIKV continues to be a concern throughout much of Latin America and the Caribbean. Travel and sexual intercourse remain the dominant transmission risk factors for women of reproductive age and their partners. This is particularly true for communities in Brooklyn, New York, that comprise large immigrant and foreign-born populations. Practitioners of public health understand little about how women at risk for ZIKV are most likely to receive information about the virus or who they trust most to provide that information. In the context of five focus group discussions, this study explored the knowledge and communication preferences of 20 women of reproductive age in Central Brooklyn. Results derived from a thematic analysis suggest that while most women are familiar with mosquitos as ZIKV vectors, knowledge of sexual transmission is considerably lower. Many respondents believe that only women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are at risk, and public health agencies, such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, remain the most trusted sources of information. These findings can support more effective communication about the risks of ZIKV infection and other vector-borne diseases to women in New York City and similar urban communities."

Disparities are observed in lung cancer rates, with African Americans (AAs) experiencing disproportionately higher incidence and mortality compared to other ethnic groups. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in lung tumorigenesis. Our objective was to identify ncRNA biomarkers associated with the racial disparity in lung cancer.Methods Using droplet digital PCR, we examined 93 lung-cancer-associated ncRNAs in the plasma and sputum samples from AA and White American (WA) participants, which included 118 patients and 92 cancer-free smokers. Subsequently, we validated our results with a separate cohort comprising 56 cases and 72 controls.Results In the AA population, plasma showed differential expression of ten ncRNAs, while sputum revealed four ncRNAs when comparing lung cancer patients to the control group. In the WA population, the plasma displayed eleven ncRNAs, and the sputum had five ncRNAs showing differential expression between the lung cancer patients and the control group. For AAs, we identified a three-ncRNA panel (plasma miRs-147b, 324-3p, 422a) diagnosing lung cancer in AAs with 86% sensitivity and 89% specificity. For WAs, a four-ncRNA panel was developed, comprising sputum miR-34a-5p and plasma miRs-103-3p, 126-3p, 205-5p, achieving 88% sensitivity and 87% specificity. These panels remained effective across different stages and histological types of lung tumors and were validated in the independent cohort.Conclusions The ethnicity-related ncRNA signatures have promise as biomarkers to address the racial disparity in lung cancer."

B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of MS via antigen presentation, T cell activation, and antibody production. In the chronic progressive cladribine trial, some patients treated with cladribine had a significant decline in oligoclonal band number. However, the mode of action of cladribine tablets (CladT) on peripheral immune cells and its biological activity within the CNS remains to be determined further.The CladB study is a longitudinal prospective investigation of CladT treatment in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Blood was sampled at Day 0, 1, 5, then once a week for 8 weeks, fortnightly up to 24 weeks, and once a month till 96 weeks for immune cells. This was compared to a historical cohort of alemtuzumab treated samples for one month. Paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood were also taken at Day 0, 48 and 96 weeks after initiating CladT for Kappa and Lambda-free light chain (кFLC, λFLC) index, oligoclonal bands (OCBs), immunoglobulin indices, inflammatory mediators and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Participants also underwent clinical and magnetic resonance imaging brain assessments.Ten participants (3 male, 7 female, mean age 35.9 ± 10.5 (SD) and Expanded disability Status Scale 2.5 (range 0-6) at baseline were enrolled. B cells, in particular memory B cells, were heavily depleted by CladT. Alemtuzumab, conversely rapidly depleted both T and B cells. Although still present, reduction in OCB numbers were observed in 4/10 participants and кFLC index reduced from mean 164.5 ± 227.1 (SD) at baseline to 71.3 ± 84.7 at 48 weeks (p=0.002) and 64.4 ± 67.3 at 96 weeks (p=0.01). This coincided with reduction in IgG index [1.1 ± 0.5 (SD) at baseline, 0.8 ± 0.4 (p=0.014) at 48 weeks and 0.8 ± 0.3 (P=0.02) at 96 weeks] and CSF CXCL-13 [88.6± 68.4 (SD) pg/mL, 39.4 ± 35.2 mg/mL (p=0.037) at 48 weeks and 19.1 ± 11.7pg/ml at 96 weeks (p=0.027)]. CSF NfL levels were reduced at 48 weeks only (p=0.01).In conclusion, our study supports the view that CladT treatment works primarily by depleting memory B-cells and antibody-secreting cell precursors in RRMS leading to sustained effects on intrathecal antibody production and total IgG associated with a reduction in the B-cell chemoattractant CXCL-13 in the CSF."

However, certain post-TAVR complications persist, with cardiac conduction abnormalities (CCA) being one of the major ones. The elevated pressure exerted by the TAVR stent onto the conduction fibers situated between the aortic annulus and the His bundle, in proximity to the atrioventricular (AV) node, may disrupt the cardiac conduction leading to the emergence of CCA. In his study, an in-silico framework was developed to assess the CCA risk, incorporating the effect of a dynamic beating heart and pre-procedural parameters such as implantation depth and preexisting cardiac asynchrony in the new onset of post-TAVR CCA. A self-expandable TAVR device deployment was simulated inside an electro-mechanically coupled beating heart model in five patient scenarios, including three implantation depths, and two preexisting cardiac asynchronies: (i) a right bundle branch block (RBBB) and (ii) a left bundle branch block (LBBB). Subsequently, several biomechanical parameters were analyzed to assess the post-TAVR CCA risk. The results manifested a lower cumulative contact pressure on the conduction fibers following TAVR for aortic deployment (0.018 MPa) compared to baseline (0.29 MPa) and ventricular deployment (0.52 MPa). Notably, the preexisting RBBB demonstrated a higher cumulative contact pressure (0.34 MPa) compared to the baseline and preexisting LBBB (0.25 MPa). Deeper implantation and preexisting RBBB cause higher stresses and contact pressure on the conduction fibers leading to an increased risk of post-TAVR CCA. Conversely, implantation above the MS landmark and preexisting LBBB reduces the risk."

The vaccine antigen, the viral spike protein hemagglutinin (HA), tends to elicit strain-specific neutralizing activity, predicting that sequential immunization with the same HA strain will boost antibodies with narrow coverage. However, repeated vaccination with homologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccine eventually elicits neutralizing activity against highly unmatched variants, questioning this immunological premise. We evaluated a longitudinal influenza vaccine cohort, where each year the subjects received the same, novel H1N1 2009 pandemic vaccine strain. Repeated vaccination gradually enhanced receptor-blocking antibodies (HAI) to highly unmatched H1N1 strains within individuals with no initial memory recall against these historical viruses. An in silico model of affinity maturation in germinal centers integrated with a model of differentiation and expansion of memory cells provides insight into the mechanisms underlying these results and shows how repeated exposure to the same immunogen can broaden the antibody response against diversified targets."

Widely used post-concussion balance tests focus primarily on static and dynamic balance, excluding the critical aspect of reactive balance. This study investigated the acute and longitudinal effects of concussion on reactive balance in collegiate athletes. The assessments were conducted at pre-season baseline and 4 post-concussion timepoints: acute, pre-return-to-play, post-return-to-play, and six months post-concussion. The instrumented-modified Push and Release test measured reactive balance. Longitudinal effects of concussions on time to stability and step latency metrics were investigated applying Generalized Estimating Equations. Acutely after concussion, athletes demonstrated impaired reactive balance, indicated by longer times to stability, in dual-task conditions (p= 0.004). These acute impairments were transient and recovered over time. Exploratory analyses revealed that athletes who sustained their first lifetime concussion exhibited both acute (p = 0.037) and longitudinal (p = 0.004 at post-return-to-play) impairments in single– and dual-task compared to controls with no lifetime concussion. This comprehensive evaluation provides insights into the multifaceted nature of post-concussion impairments and emphasizes the importance of considering cognitive demand and history of concussions in assessing athletes’ balance."

Workflows based on Illumina short-read sequencing are becoming established in diagnostic laboratories. However, barriers to broader take-up include the need for high sequencing depths, long turnaround times, and limited sensitivity. Newer metagenomics protocols based on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing allow acquisition and analysis of data in real time, potentially reducing the need for high-volume sequencing and enabling point-of-care testing. Furthermore, targeted approaches that selectively amplify known pathogens could improve sensitivity.Methods We evaluated detection of viruses with readily available untargeted metagenomic workflows using Illumina and ONT, and an Illumina-based enrichment approach using the Twist Biosciences Viral Research Panel (VRP), which targets 3153 viruses. We tested samples consisting of a dilution series of a six-virus mock community in a human DNA/RNA background, designed to resemble clinical specimens with low microbial abundance and high host content. Protocols were designed to retain the host transcriptome, since this could help confirm the absence of infectious agents. We further compared the performance of commonly used taxonomic classifiers.Results Capture with the Twist VRP increased sensitivity by at least 10-100-fold over untargeted sequencing, making it suitable for the detection of low viral loads (60 genome copies per ml (gc/ml)), but additional methods may be needed in a diagnostic setting to detect untargeted organisms. While untargeted ONT had good sensitivity at high viral loads (60,000 gc/ml), at lower viral loads (600-6,000 gc/ml), longer and more costly sequencing runs would be required to achieve sensitivities comparable to the untargeted Illumina protocol. Untargeted ONT provided better specificity than untargeted Illumina sequencing. However, the application of robust thresholds standardized results between taxonomic classifiers. Host gene expression analysis is optimal with untargeted Illumina sequencing but possible with both the VRP and ONT.Conclusions Metagenomics has the potential to become standard-of-care in diagnostics and is a powerful tool for the discovery of emerging pathogens. Untargeted Illumina and ONT metagenomics and capture with the Twist VRP have different advantages with respect to sensitivity, specificity, turnaround time and cost, and the optimal method will depend on the clinical context."

However, whether the racial differences in occult hypoxemia are mediated by other clinical differences is unknown.Methods We conducted a retrospective case-control study utilizing two large ICU databases (eICU and MIMIC-IV). We defined occult hypoxemia as oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry within 92-98% despite oxygen saturation on arterial blood gas below 90%. We assessed associations of commonly measured clinical factors with occult hypoxemia using multivariable logistic regression and conducted mediation analysis of the racial effect.Results Among 24,641 patients, there were 1,855 occult hypoxemia cases and 23,786 controls. In both datasets, Black patients were more likely to have occult hypoxemia (unadjusted odds ratio 1.66 [95%-CI: 1.41-1.95] in eICU and 2.00 [95%-CI: 1.22-3.14] in MIMIC-IV). In multivariable models, higher respiratory rate, PaCO2 and creatinine as well as lower hemoglobin were associated with increased odds of occult hypoxemia. Differences in the commonly measured clinical markers accounted for 9.2% and 44.4% of the racial effect on occult hypoxemia in eICU and MIMIC-IV, respectively.Conclusion Clinical differences, in addition to skin tone, might mediate some of the racial differences in occult hypoxemia."

Policies to effectively promote health require the decomposition of social change into its age-period-cohort components. As a first step, we provide a descriptive age-cohort analysis to identify patterns of generational change in key behavioural risk factors between and within post-war cohorts of working age in England.Data Cross-sectional Health Survey for England data for participants aged 25-60 years was pooled between 1994-2019 (n=153,172) to construct five decennial cohorts (1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s). Socioeconomic status was classified by neighbourhood deprivation quintiles using the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Five behavioural risk factors were analysed: cigarette smoking (current-and heavy-smoking); alcohol consumption (frequency and heavy drinking); obesity; meeting recommended levels of physical activity and fruit and vegetables consumption.Methods Sex-specific analyses were conducted. Log-binomial regression models quantified the magnitude and direction of change in (i) prevalence ratios (PRs) between cohorts adjusting for age and deprivation and (ii) deprivation-specific PRs within- and between-cohorts to examine changes in absolute and relative inequalities between generations.Results In more recent cohorts, decreases in prevalence, independent of age and deprivation, were observed for current smoking, frequency of alcohol consumption and heavy drinking, resulting in decreasing absolute inequalities. However, obesity levels, particularly among females, reached their highest levels in the youngest 1980s cohort.Relative inequalities in current smoking (most-versus least-deprived quintiles) peaked in the 1950s cohort (Males: PR 2.79 (95% CI: 2.57-3.04); Females: PR 2.81; 95% CI: 2.60-3.05)), decreased in the 1960s cohort (M: PR 2.00 (95% CI: 1.70-2.34); F: PR 2.58 (95% CI: 2.40-2.77)), and remained stable thereafter. Inequalities in heavy smoking persisted over time among current smokers.Higher obesity levels in the most-versus least-deprived quintiles were generally persistent across all five cohorts, albeit with some suggestion of widening inequalities in the younger-versus older-cohorts in females (1940s cohort: PR 1.55 (95% CI: 1.40-1.72); 1960s cohort: PR 1.87 (95% CI: 1.73-2.01)). This pattern was also observed for mean body mass index (BMI).For heavy drinking, relative inequality remained stable. Relative inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption were lower in more recent cohorts. Physical activity levels were similar across cohorts, with little evidence of inequalities.Conclusion Our analysis of generational change reveals credible signals of behavioural risk factor changes in levels and in inequalities over successive post-war cohorts of working age."

The Sepsis-3 consensus associates sepsis diagnosis with acute organ dysfunction. In these patients troponin elevation is a well-established phenomenon, but its clinical significance is not settled, as no systematic review has addressed the prognostic significance of the increasingly prevalent high-sensitivity troponin assays in acute organ dysfunction setting.This study aims to clarify the association between early serum troponin levels in high-sensitivity assays with short-term mortality risk in septic patients with acute organ dysfunction.Methods We will systematically search PubMed, Scopus and Embase for original articles; additionally, a manual search will be carried out through relevant literature. Generally, studies will be deemed eligible for inclusion if they evaluate the association between high-sensitivity troponin in the first 24 hours of admission and ICU, 30-days, or In-hospital mortality; in patients with septic shock or sepsis related to acute organ dysfunction. Two reviewers will independently select studies and extract the data. A meta-analysis for mortality outcome will be performed for comparative data regarding two effect measures: Odd ratios and Standardized Mean differences.Discussion This study will provide further evidence about the role of high-sensitivity troponin assays in predicting mortality in septic patients; potentially helping to guide further research and yielding valuable information for patient assessment.Conclusion about the certainty of evidence will be presented in a ‘Summary of finding’ table.PROSPERO registration: (CRD42024468883)"

In substance use disorders (SUDs), deployment of CM has been enriched by longstanding discussions around the cost-effectiveness of prized-based and voucher-based approaches. In prize-based CM, participants earn draws to win prizes, including small incentives to reduce costs, and the number of draws escalates depending on the duration of maintenance of abstinence. In voucher-based CM, participants receive a predetermined voucher amount based on specific substance test results. While both types have enhanced treatment outcomes, there is room for improvement in their cost-effectiveness: the voucher-based system requires enduring financial investment; the prize-based system might sacrifice efficacy. Previous work in computational psychiatry of SUDs typically employs frameworks wherein participants make decisions to maximize their expected compensation. In contrast, we developed new frameworks that clinical decision-makers choose actions, CM structures, to reinforce the substance abstinence behavior of participants. We consider the choice of the voucher or prize to be a sequential decision, where there are two pivotal parameters: the prize probability for each draw and the escalation rule determining the number of draws. Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning, more specifically, in off-policy evaluation, afforded techniques to estimate outcomes for different CM decision scenarios from observed clinical trial data. We searched CM schemas that maximized treatment outcomes with budget constraints. Using this framework, we analyzed data from the Clinical Trials Network to construct unbiased estimators on the effects of new CM schemas. Our results indicated that the optimal CM schema would be to strengthen reinforcement rapidly in the middle of the treatment course. Our estimated optimal CM policy improved treatment outcomes by 32% while maintaining costs. Our methods and results have broad applications in future clinical trial planning and translational investigations on the neurobiological basis of SUDs."

This study evaluates how outcomes of Phoneme Recognition in Quiet tests (PRQ) differ from those of more commonly used word recognition tests (CVC) and outlines how these tests may be useful for different purposes in clinical adult CI care.Methods As part of the AuDiET (Auditory Diagnostics and Error-based Treatment) study, 23 adult postlingually deafened unilateral CI users underwent a battery of tests, including both PRQ and CVC tests. Their results were compared at the phoneme level, including an evaluation of fitness and error dispersion.Results PRQ had a significantly lower accuracy and fitness than CVC. The error patterns also tended to be less random and more systematic. Fitness correlated strongly and positively with accuracy, while error dispersion negatively correlated with accuracy.Conclusion There are clear differences between PRQ and CVC outcomes in absolute accuracy and error distribution. Comparing these tests might provide clinicians with more granular insights into which areas/phonemes to target during mapping, to achieve optimal speech recognition."

Here, we applied a new technology that generates contiguous long reads via tagmentation and sequencing by synthesis to a small cohort of patients with undiagnosed disease from the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. We first compare sequencing from the HG002 benchmark sample from Genome In A Bottle using nanopore sequencing (R10.4.1, duplex reads, Oxford Nanopore), single molecule real time sequencing (Revio SMRT cell, Pacific Biosciences) and complete long read sequencing (S4 flowcell, Novaseq, Illumina). Coverage was 33-35x across platforms. Read length N50 was 6.5kb (ICLR), 16.9kb (SMRT), and 33.8kb (ONT). We noted small differences in single nucleotide variant F1 scores across long read technologies with single nucleotide variant F1 scores (0.985-0.999) exceeding indel scores (0.78-0.99) and structural variant scores (0.74-0.96). We applied CLR sequencing to seven undiagnosed patients. In one patient, we detected and prioritized a novel 16kb intragenic duplication encompassing exons 5 and 6 in EHMT1. Resolution of the breakpoints and examination of flanking sequences revealed that the duplication was present in tandem and was predicted to result in a frameshift of the amino acid sequence and an early termination codon. It resulted in a diagnosis of Kleefstra syndrome. The variant was confirmed with targeted EHMT1 clinical testing and detected via nanopore and SMRT sequencing. In summary, we report the early clinical application of complete long read sequencing to a small cohort of undiagnosed patients."

Despite their utility, a comprehensive PREM addressing PC has been lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed the preliminary version of the Experienced Patient-Centeredness Questionnaire (EPAT), a disease-generic tool based on the integrative model of PC comprising 16 dimensions. It demonstrated content validity. The aim of this study was to test its psychometric properties and to develop a final 64-items version (EPAT-64).Methods In this cross-sectional study, we included adult patients treated for cardiovascular diseases, cancer, musculoskeletal diseases, and mental disorders in inpatient or outpatient settings in Germany. For each dimension of PC, we selected four items based on item characteristics such as item difficulty and corrected item-total correlation. We tested structural validity using confirmatory factor analysis, examined reliability by McDondald’s Omega, and tested construct validity by examining correlations with general health status and satisfaction with care.Results Analysis of data from 2.024 patients showed excellent acceptance and acceptable item-total-correlations for all EPAT-64 items, with few items demonstrating ceiling effects. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated the best fit of a bifactor model, where each item loaded on both a general factor and a dimension-specific factor. Omega showed high reliability for the general factor while varying for specific dimensions. Construct validity was confirmed by absence of strong correlations with general health status and a strong correlation of the general factor with satisfaction with care.Conclusions The EPAT-64 demonstrated commendable psychometric properties. This tool allows comprehensive assessment of PC, offering flexibility to users who can measure each dimension with a 4-item module or choose modules based on their needs. The EPAT-64 serves multiple purposes, including quality improvement initiatives and evaluation of interventions aiming to enhance PC. Its versatility empowers users in diverse healthcare settings.What is already known on this topic Patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) can be used to assess patient-centeredness (PC) from the patients’ perspective. The “Experienced Patient-Centeredness Questionnaire” (EPAT) is the first PREM to comprehensively assess 16 dimensions of PC.What this study adds In this study, we tested the psychometric properties of all items developed for the EPAT and developed the 64-item version of the EPAT (EPAT-64), which demonstrated good psychometric properties.How this study might affect research, practice or policy The EPAT-64 can be used in research and routine care, e.g. to evaluate interventions, provide feedback to healthcare professionals, support quality improvement, set benchmarks, and, consequently improve PC."

However, previously-reported clinically-relevant variants and other predicted damaging missense (DM) variants have not been characterized in a newer release of the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP).Objective To characterize previously-reported clinically-relevant variants and DM variants in PSEN2, PSEN1, APP within the participants from the ADSP.Methods We identified rare variants (MAF <1%) previously-reported in PSEN2, PSEN1, and APP in the available ADSP sample of 14,641 individuals with whole genome sequencing and 16,849 individuals with whole exome sequencing available for research-use (Ntotal = 31,490). We additionally curated variants in these three genes from ClinVar, OMIM, and Alzforum and report carriers of variants in clinical databases as well as predicted DM variants in these genes.Results We detected 31 previously-reported clinically-relevant variants with alternate alleles observed within the ADSP: 4 variants in PSEN2, 25 in PSEN1, and 2 in APP. The overall variant carrier rate for the 31 clinically-relevant variants in the ADSP was 0.3%. We observed that 79.5% of the variant carriers were cases compared to 3.9% were controls. In those with AD, the mean age of onset of AD among carriers of these clinically-relevant variants was 19.6 ± 1.4 years earlier compared with non-carriers (p-value=7.8×10-57).Conclusion A small proportion of individuals in the ADSP are carriers of a previously-reported clinically-relevant variant allele for AD and these participants have significantly earlier age of AD onset compared to non-carriers."

Though definitive diagnosis requires post-mortem pathological analysis, clinical and radiographic criteria allow for noninvasive, in vivo diagnosis. We sought to validate the new ICD-10-CM diagnostic code for CAA with respect to the recently updated Boston criteria, version 2.0.Methods We conducted a retrospective study of inpatient and outpatient encounters at a single hospital center, Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), from 10/1/2015 to 12/31/2018. We randomly selected 25 encounters with the ICD-10-CM code I68.0 and 25 encounters with a primary diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage or ischemic stroke, without code I68.0. A single board-certified neurologist, blinded to ICD codes, reviewed detailed medical records and images from brain MRI and CT scans from all 50 selected encounters and identified subjects with possible or probable CAA by Boston criteria 2.0. Sensitivity and specificity of ICD-10-CM code I68.0 was calculated.Results Of the 50 selected encounters, 21 (42%) met criteria for possible or probable CAA: 18 (36%) met criteria for probable CAA, 2 (4%) met criteria for probable CAA with supporting pathology, and 1 (2%) met criteria for possible CAA. The ICD-10-CM code I68.0 was found to have a sensitivity of 81% (95% CI, 58-95%) and specificity of 72% (95% CI, 53-87%) for identifying possible or probable CAA.Conclusion The ICD-10-CM code I68.0 was found to have good sensitivity and moderate specificity for CAA as defined by current clinical and radiographic diagnostic criteria. Based on our results, this code may be useful for identifying patients with CAA in future research using administrative claims data."

Yet, major cardiovascular and nephrology guidelines offer contrasting recommendations on the use of iron. We evaluated the effects of iron versus usual care/placebo on clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials of intravenous or oral iron in CKD (PROSPERO CRD42023453468). We searched Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Register from database inception until February 1, 2024 to identify eligible trials. We determined results overall and stratified by dialysis- and non-dialysis-requiring CKD using random effects models, with certainty of evidence assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The primary composite endpoint was heart failure hospitalisation or cardiovascular death.Results We identified 45 trials that met our inclusion criteria. Compared to usual care/placebo, iron reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint (1659 events; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.94; moderate certainty) an effect consistent across dialysis and non-dialysis requiring CKD (P-heterogeneity=0.70). The effect on the primary endpoint appeared driven by both components of hospitalisation for heart failure (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.61-0.96; moderate certainty) and cardiovascular death (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.65-1.02; low certainty). The incidence of serious adverse events was lower for iron compared to usual care/placebo (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.98; moderate certainty; P-heterogeneity=0.09).Conclusion Iron therapies may reduce the risk of heart failure or cardiovascular death in patients with CKD. Randomised trials evaluating effects of iron on clinical outcomes are needed, especially in non-dialysis CKD, with or without anaemia."

Manual segmentation from CBCT scans is labor-intensive and error-prone.Methods We introduce SISTR (Sinus and IAN Segmentation with Targeted Refinement), a deep learning framework for automated, high-resolution instance segmentation of oral cavity anatomies. SISTR operates in two stages: first, it predicts coarse segmentation and offset maps to anatomical regions, followed by clustering to identify region centroids. Subvolumes of individual anatomical instances are then extracted and processed by the model for fine structure segmentation. Our model was developed on the most diverse dataset to date for sinus and IAN segmentation, sourced from 11 dental clinics and 10 manufacturers (358 CBCTs for sinus, 499 for IAN).Results SISTR shows robust generalizability. It achieves strong segmentation performance on an external test set (98 sinus, 91 IAN CBCTs), reaching average DICE scores of 96.64% (95.38-97.60) for sinus and 83.43% (80.96-85.63) for IAN, representing a significant 10 percentage point improvement in Dice score for IAN compared to single-stage methods. Chamfer distances of 0.38 (0.24-0.60) mm for sinus and 0.88 (0.58-1.27) mm for IAN confirm its accuracy. Its inference time of 4 seconds per scan reduces time required for manual segmentation, which can take up to 28 minutes.Conclusions SISTR offers a fast, accurate, and efficient solution for the segmentation of critical anatomies in dental implantology, making it a valuable tool in digital dentistry.Plain text summary Accurately determining the locations of important structures such as the maxillary sinus and inferior alveolar nerve is crucial in dental implant surgery to avoid complications. The conventional method of manually mapping these areas from CBCT scans is time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we have developed SISTR, an AI-based framework that efficiently and accurately automates this process, trained on extensive datasets, sourced from 11 dental clinics and 10 manufacturers. It surpasses conventional methods by identifying anatomical regions within seconds. SISTR provides a rapid and accurate solution for high-resolution segmentation of critical anatomies in dental implantology, making it a valuable tool in digital dentistry."

The brain can learn to predict pain in a more fundamental way, simply by experiencing fluctuating, non-random streams of noxious inputs, and extracting their temporal regularities. This process is called statistical learning. Here we address a key open question: does statistical learning modulate pain perception? We asked 27 participants to both rate and predict pain intensity levels in sequences of fluctuating heat pain. Using a computational approach, we show that probabilistic expectations and confidence were used to weight pain perception and prediction. As such, this study goes beyond well-established conditioning paradigms associating non-pain cues with pain outcomes, and shows that statistical learning itself shapes pain experience. This finding opens a new path of research into the brain mechanisms of pain regulation, with relevance to chronic pain where it may be dysfunctional."

A sleep study, also known as polysomnography (PSG), is typically used to compute the Apnea–Hypopnea Index (AHI), the number of times a person has apnea or certain types of hypopnea per hour of sleep. AHI is then used to diagnose the severity of the sleep disorder. Early detection and treatment of apnea can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. However, continuous PSG monitoring is unfeasible as it is costly and uncomfortable for patients. To circumvent these issues, we propose a method, named DRIVEN, to estimate AHI at home from wearable devices and assist physicians in diagnosing the severity of apneas. DRIVEN also detects when apnea, hypopnea, periods of wakefulness occur throughout the night, facilitating easy inspection by physicians. Patients can wear a single sensor or a combination of sensors that can be easily measured at home: abdominal movement, thoracic movement, or pulse oximetry. For example, using only two sensors, DRIVEN correctly classifies 72.4% of all test patients into one of the four AHI classes, with 99.3% either correctly classified or placed one class away from the true one. This is a reasonable trade-off between the model’s performance and patient’s comfort. We use data from three sleep studies from the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), the largest public repository, consisting of 14,370 recordings. DRIVEN is based on a combination of deep convolutional neural networks and a light-gradient-boost machine for classification. Since DRIVEN is simple and computationally efficient, it can be implemented for automatic estimation of AHI in unsupervised long-term home monitoring systems, reducing costs to healthcare systems and improving patient care."

This study develops and analyzes a model to understand the interplay between malaria dynamics, economic growth, and transient events. It uncovers varied effects of malaria and economic parameters on model outcomes, highlighting the interdependence of the reproduction number (R0) on both malaria and economic factors, and a reciprocal relationship where malaria diminishes economic productivity, while higher economic output is associated with reduced malaria prevalence. This emphasizes the intricate interplay between malaria dynamics and socio-economic factors. The study offers insights into malaria control and underscores the significance of optimizing external aid allocation, especially favoring an even distribution strategy, with the most significant reduction observed in an equal monthly distribution strategy compared to longer distribution intervals. Furthermore, the study shows that controlling malaria in high mosquito biting areas with limited aid, low technology, inadequate treatment, or low economic investment is challenging. The model exhibits a backward bifurcation implying that sustainability of control and mitigation measures is essential even when R0 is slightly less than one. Additionally, there is a parameter regime for which long transients are feasible. Long transients are critical for predicting the behavior of dynamic systems and identifying factors influencing transitions; they reveal reservoirs of infection, vital for disease control. Policy recommendations for effective malaria control from the study include prioritizing sustained control measures, optimizing external aid allocation, and reducing mosquito biting."

Previous evidence has shown that migrants and refugees are particularly vulnerable to exclusion and discrimination, and low COVID-19 vaccine intention and uptake were observed among refugees globally. This study aimed to develop and internally validate prediction models of COVID-19 vaccine uptake by nationality.Methods This is a nested prognostic population-based cross-sectional analysis. Data was collected between June and October 2022 in Sin-El-Fil, a district of Beirut, Lebanon. All Syrian adults and a random sample of adults from low-socioeconomic status neighborhoods were invited to participate in a telephone survey. The main outcome was uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake were assessed using LASSO regression for Lebanese and Syrian nationalities, respectively.Results Of 2,045 participants, 79% were Lebanese, 18% Syrians and 3% of other nationalities. COVID-19 vaccination uptake was higher among Lebanese (85% (95%CI:82-86) compared to Syrians (47% (95% CI:43-51)) (P<0.001); adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 6.8 (95%CI:5.5-8.4). Predictors of uptake of one or more vaccine dose for Lebanese were older age, presence of an older adult in the household, higher education, greater asset-based wealth index, private healthcare coverage, feeling susceptible to COVID-19, belief in the safety and efficacy of vaccines and previous receipt of flu vaccine. For Syrians they were older age, male, completing school or higher education, receipt of cash assistance, presence of comorbidities, belief in the safety and efficacy of vaccines, previous receipt of flu vaccine, and legal residency status in Lebanon.Conclusions These findings indicate barriers for vaccine uptake in Syrian migrants and refugees, including legal residency status. They call for urgent action to enable equitable access to vaccines by raising awareness about the importance of vaccination and the targeting of migrant and refugee populations through vaccination campaigns.What is already known on this topic Vaccines are essential to prevent infection and reduce morbidity of infectious diseases, and vulnerable populations may lack access to vaccination campaigns.What this study adds To the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined compared predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake and measured the rate of vaccination among between Syrian migrants and refugees and their Lebanese host communities. This study illustrates a clear difference in vaccine uptake between nationalities and developed prediction models among the Syrian and Lebanese that identified differential predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake for each population.How this study might affect research, practice or policy These findings indicate barriers for vaccine uptake in Syrian migrants and refugees, including legal status, and calls for urgent action to enable access to vaccines by raising awareness about the importance of vaccination against COVID-19 in vulnerable groups and targeting migrant and refugee populations through vaccination campaigns."

We detected the presence of P. aeruginosa in 22% (53 out of 238) of the test samples collected from patients with infections including secondary wound infections, abscesses and urinary tract infections admitted to two academic hospitals in Bangladesh. Resistance to carbapenems (imipenem, and meropenem) was present among 30% (16 out of 53) of these clinical P. aeruginosa isolates, which is more than 2-fold higher compared to that of previous studies. Such a rapid increase in carbapenem resistance was mediated by metallo-β-lactamase (MBL). Expression of MBL was detected in 90% (14 out of 16) of these resistant isolates. Molecular analyses revealed that the carbapenem-resistant isolates carried at least one of the MBL variants, either bla-VIM or bla-NDM-1. All the bla-NDM-1 positives carried a 0.5 MDa plasmid. ERIC-PCR revealed the highly heterogeneous nature of the P. aeruginosa isolates indicating multiple sources of infection within the hospital. However, the majority of XDR isolates belonged to a single cluster of drug-resistant bacterial infections. These findings indicate that Metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) mediated resistance to carbapenem in P. aeruginosa poses a serious threat to the spread of infections among hospitalized patients."

In this study, we asked if seizure freedom would be achieved using virtual resections of fast ripple (FR) networks. We compared these virtual resections to the individual patient’s actual resection and clinical outcome. We conclude that the SOZ is the minimum territory of cortex that must be resected to achieve seizure freedom. By utilizing support vector machines (SVMs) with an accuracy of 0.78 for labeling seizure freedom using factors from FR networks we could predict whether resection of the SOZ corresponded with a seizure free outcome. Furthermore, this approach could identify regions that generate FR autonomously and at high rates outside the SOZ. In the patients who experienced seizures after resection of the SOZ, virtual resections that included the SOZ and other FR generating regions rendered the patient virtually seizure free. We examined responsive neurostimulator system (RNS) patients and virtually targeted the RNS stimulation contacts proximal to sites generating FR. We used the simulations to investigate if the likelihood of a RNS super responder (>90% seizure reduction) outcome would be increased."

Current grading systems for OED may not be reliable for prediction of malignant transformation and suffer from considerable inter- and intra-rater variability, potentially leading to suboptimal treatment decisions. Recent studies have highlighted the potential prognostic significance of peri-epithelial lymphocytes (PELs) in malignant transformation, with suggestions that intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) may also play a role. In this study, we propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI) based IEL score from Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of OED tissue slides. We further determine the prognostic value of our IEL score on a large digital dataset of 219 OED WSIs (acquired using three different scanners), compared to pathologist-led clinical grading. Notably, despite IELs not being incorporated into the current WHO grading system for OED, our findings suggest that IEL scores carry significant prognostic value that were shown to further improve both the Binary/WHO grading systems in multivariate analyses. This underscores the potential importance of IELs, and by extension our IEL score, as prognostic indicators in OED. Further validation through prospective multi-centric studies is warranted to confirm the clinical utility of the proposed IEL score and its integration into existing grading systems for OED.Conflict of Interest StatementsNMR is the co-founder, CEO and CSO of Histofy Ltd., UK.

Regional genetic profiling is essential for distinguishing common benign variants from disease-causing ones. To this end, we conducted a comprehensive characterization of exonic variants in the population of Navarre (Spain).Methods Genome sequencing data from 358 unrelated individuals of Spanish origin from the Navarrese population were used.Results Our analysis revealed 61,410 biallelic exonic single nucleotide variants (SNV) within the Navarrese cohort, with 35% classified as common (MAF > 1%). By comparing allele frequency data from 1000 Genome Project (excluding the Iberian cohort of Spain, IBS), Genome Aggregation Database, and a Spanish cohort (including IBS individuals and data from Medical Genome Project), we identified 1,069 SNVs common in Navarre but rare (MAF ≤ 1%) in all other populations. We further corroborated this observation with a second regional cohort of 239 unrelated exomes, which confirmed 676 of the 1,069 SNVs as common in Navarre.Conclusion This study highlights the importance of population-specific characterization of genetic variation to improve allele frequency filtering in sequencing data analysis to identify disease-causing variants."

In experiment 1, foveal and peripheral CS were assessed in suspected POAG patients and age-matched healthy control subjects. In experiment 2, foveal CS was assessed in early POAG patients age-matched with suspected POAG group. Analysis was done considering two age ranges (Under and Over 50 years of age). Correlations between CS and clinical parameters were evaluated.Results Peripheral CS was decreased only for older POAG suspect patients from the control group (Over 50: p = 0.008. Under 50: p = 0.566). Foveal CS was reduced in POAG suspect participants for both age ranges (Over 50: p = 0.028. Under 50: p < 0.001) and in early POAG patients (Under 50: p = 0.001; Over 50: p < 0.001), both compared to the control group. Foveal CS was lower in early POAG compared to POAG suspect for older patients (Over 50: p = 0.019. Under 50: p = 0.824). Foveal CS was correlated with cup-disc ratio in early POAG patients (Early: p < 0.001. Suspect: p = 0.766) and with age in both patient groups (Early: p = 0.001. Suspect: p = 0.002).Conclusion CS is affected in patients with a high risk of developing POAG and recently diagnosed. Our results suggest that CS could serve as a screening tool, detecting early damage even before structural changes occur."

Nirsevimab, an extended half-life monoclonal antibody, was recently approved in Canada as a passive immunization intervention for the prevention of RSV LRTI. A static decision tree model was utilized to determine the cost-effectiveness of nirsevimab in Canadian infants compared to current standard of care (palivizumab for infants born preterm, and with specific chronic conditions) and generate an optimal price per dose (PPD) at accepted willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. Various health outcomes (including hospitalization, ICU, and mechanical ventilation) and healthcare costs were calculated over one RSV season, with any necessary follow-up prophylaxis in the second season for three infant categories (palivizumab-eligible, preterm, and term). All health-related parameters and costs were tailored to the Canadian environment. Compared to scenarios where only at-risk segments of the infant population received nirsevimab, the base case (administering nirsevimab to all infants in their first RSV season) was the most cost-effective versus standard care: the PPD was $692 at a $40,000/QALY WTP threshold, using average costing data assumptions across all scenarios. Compared to standard care, the base case scenario could avoid 18,249 RSV-related health outcomes (reduction of 9.96%). Variations in discount rate, distribution of monthly RSV infections, nirsevimab coverage rate for infants born at term, and palivizumab cost had the most significant model impact. Passive immunization of all infants with nirsevimab can significantly reduce RSV-related health and economic burden across Canada."

In the same period, a pairwise comparison of subjects (n=13) undergoing both minimal COS for IVM and conventional COS for oocyte cryopreservation was conducted.Intervention/Exposure Minimal and conventional controlled ovarian stimulation.Main Outcome Measures The most common side effects suffered during ovarian stimulation and after OPU, satisfaction level, and the likelihood of recommending or repeating minimal or conventional COS. Statistical analysis included Mann Whitney, Wilcoxon, Chi-square, and McNemar tests, with a significance level set at p<0.05.Results During minimal COS, most subjects did not experience breast swelling (86%), pelvic or abdominal pain (76%), nausea or vomiting (96%), and bleeding (96%). After oocyte pick-up, the majority (75%) reported no pelvic or abdominal pain. The most common side effect was abdominal swelling (52%). Compared to conventional COS cycles, minimal COS subjects reported significantly less post-retrieval pain, with 33% experiencing no pain (vs. 6%; p=0.0011) and with a reduced severe level of pain (5% vs.19%; p=0.0097), leading to fewer subjects requiring pain medication (25% vs. 54%; p=0.0003). Additionally, 85% of women were very satisfied with minimal stimulation and would recommend or repeat the treatment. In the comparison in which each donor underwent both minimal and conventional COS treatments, women indicated more side effects with the conventional stimulation, presenting a significantly overall higher level of pain (p=0.0078).Conclusion Reducing the hormonal dose for ovarian stimulation has a beneficial effect on subjects, suggesting the combination of minimal COS with IVM techniques is a well-tolerated alternative for women who cannot or do not wish to undergo conventional controlled ovarian hyperstimulation."

Since 2000 this gap has narrowed. We examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these long-term mortality trends and differences.Methods Nationally reported mortality data were used to estimate East-West differences in excess mortality and life expectancy losses. Regression and decomposition methods were employed to examine the contribution of vaccination, trust in government, regulatory enforcement, and air connectivity between populations to these differences.Results During the pandemic, the East-West life expectancy gap widened to its highest level in more than two decades. Moreover, the trajectory of excess mortality during the pandemic differed between East and West, with levels of excess mortality in the East being minimal until autumn 2020. Cumulative excess mortality in weeks 10-18 of 2020 was correlated with an index of air connectivity, which was appreciably lower in Eastern compared to Western European countries in the immediate pre-pandemic period. From October 2020 onwards, the East suffered greater losses in life expectancy, especially in 2021. This could not be explained by greater frailty of the Eastern European populations, as indicated by higher pre-pandemic mortality levels. Half of the difference between East and West in 2021 was jointly explained by COVID-19 vaccination levels and trust in government.Conclusions East-West contrasts in the timing and magnitude of life expectancy losses during the COVID-19 pandemic appear to have their ultimate origins in differences between societies that were established during the Cold War. These include differences in the connectivity of populations, levels of trust in science and authorities and the related capacity of Eastern countries to mount effective vaccination campaigns."

However, analysis of sulfated glycans poses challenges, making the investigation of sulfated glycan profiles a topic of significant interest in the search for novel biomarkers for early BC detection. We used a glycoblotting-based sulphoglycomics workflow to examine sulfated N-glycans present in the serum of Ethiopian patients with BC. Seven mono-sulfated glycans were significantly upregulated in the sera of BC patients compared to the control group. Each identified glycan showed significant abundance with AUC ≥ 0.8 and demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in predicting early stage BC patients. Importantly, the sulfated glycans were analyzed without removing the sialic group, allowing for comprehensive evaluation of the sialylation status of the identified sulfated glycans. This study represents the first quantitative analysis of sulfated N-glycans in patients with BC and identifies novel biomarkers with discriminatory potential in the early stages of BC.Statement of significance This study presents a quantitative analysis of sulfated N-glycans in BC, aiming to identify novel glyco-biomarkers that demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy for early stage BC. Analyzing sulfated glycans without removing sialic acids offers comprehensive insights. These findings advance the understanding of BC, potentially enhance early detection, and improve patient outcomes."

Patients discharged with GBS as main diagnosis and admitted during 2018-2021 were included. Data on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccinations were obtained from the National Epidemiology Centre.RESULTS In total, 3147 cases were included, 832 in 2018, 861 in 2019, 670 in 2020 and 784 in 2021. Nationwide hospital incidence was 1.78 in 2018, 1.71 in 2019, 1.41 in 2020 and 1.66 in 2021, with an increased frequency in males, elderly population, and in the winter season. Eleven percent of GBS patients needed ventilatory support. GBS and SARS-CoV-2 incidences did not correlate with one another (r=-0.29, p=0.36). GBS incidence decreased during 2020 and during COVID-19 lockdown period in comparison to the same months of 2018-2019. No relationship was found between vaccines and GBS cases during vaccination roll-out in 2021.INTERPRETATION Incidence of GBS in Spain is similar to that of other countries. Despite prior reports describing a significant increase in COVID-19-associated GBS in Spain, we detected a significant drop of GBS incidence during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, probably due to prevention measures. No relationship was found between SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinations and GBS incidences at the population level but data on relationship of vaccinations and GBS at the individual level were not available."

The Open Targets Platform (OT) integrates biomedical, genetic, and biochemical datasets to empower disease ontologies, classifications, and potential gene targets. Nevertheless, many disease annotations are incomplete, requiring laborious expert medical input. This challenge is especially pronounced for rare and orphan diseases, where resources are scarce.Methods We present a machine learning approach to identifying diseases with potential subtypes, using the approximately 23,000 diseases documented in OT. We derive novel features for predicting diseases with subtypes using direct evidence. Machine learning models were applied to analyze feature importance and evaluate predictive performance for discovering both known and novel disease subtypes.Results Our model achieves a high (89.4%) ROC AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) in identifying known disease subtypes. We integrated pre-trained deep-learning language models and showed their benefits. Moreover, we identify 515 disease candidates predicted to possess previously unannotated subtypes.Conclusions Our models can partition diseases into distinct subtypes. This methodology enables a robust, scalable approach for improving knowledge-based annotations and a comprehensive assessment of disease ontology tiers. Our candidates are attractive targets for further study and personalized medicine, potentially aiding in the unveiling of new therapeutic indications for sought-after targets."

Cough is often perceived as difficult to quantify, frequently self-limiting, and non-specific. However, cough has a central role in the clinical detection of many lung diseases including tuberculosis (TB), which remains the leading infectious disease killer worldwide. TB screening currently relies on self-reported cough which fails to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) accuracy targets for a TB triage test. Artificial intelligence (AI) models based on cough sound have been developed for several respiratory conditions, with limited work being done in TB. To support the development of an accurate, point-of-care cough-based triage tool for TB, we have compiled a large multi-country database of cough sounds from individuals being evaluated for TB. The dataset includes more than 700,000 cough sounds from 2,143 individuals with detailed demographic, clinical and microbiologic diagnostic information. We aim to empower researchers in the development of cough sound analysis models to improve TB diagnosis, where innovative approaches are critically needed to end this long-standing pandemic."

We control for socio-demographic characteristics, working time and self-reported measures of health. The initial sample includes 7,082 respondents. We use mixed effects modified Poisson regression for binary outcomes for sleep quality and linear mixed effects for sleep duration and multiple imputations to correct for sample attrition.Results No major difference is observed between employment status and poor sleep quality except for housekeepers (0.123 [ 95%CI: 0.041; 0.205]) in comparison with full-time employed workers. All categories of workers tend to report sleeping longer than full-time employees with higher hours among those who retired (0.339 [95%CI: 0.218; 0.460]). Poor job satisfaction is associated with higher risks of self-reported poor sleep quality (0.230 [95%CI: 0.040, 0.421]) and waking up at night (0.362 [95%CI: 0.025, 0.699]) but the associations fade away when controlling for other health measurements (respectively, −0.137 [95%CI: −0.328, 0.054] and 0.092 [95%CI: −0.248; 0.432]).Conclusion Retirement increases sleep duration without improving sleep quality and housekeepers sleep longer but with poorer sleep quality. Job satisfaction is a major cofounder of sleep quality among the workforce but the effect is mediated by physical and mental health levels."

Currently, no effective preventative strategies exist to mitigate CSA-AKI. Sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduced acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence in large, randomized placebo-controlled, cardiovascular and kidney outcome trials conducted in patients with chronic kidney disease. We hypothesized that perioperative SGLT2 inhibition could also reduce CSA-AKI.Methods In this open-label phase IV, randomized, parallel-group, pilot study, adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to receive the SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin (10 mg; oral), once daily three days prior to surgery and continued to two days after surgery compared with standard-of-care. Biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI), including serum and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), serum and urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and serum hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) were measured. Additional outcomes included AKI incidence according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria as well as metabolic parameters, including ketone body concentrations and glycemic control.Results Between March 2022 and April 2023, 55 patients were included (sex: 73% male, age: 66 ± 10 years, BMI: 28 ± 4 kg/m2, empagliflozin n = 25, control n = 30) in the intention-to-treat analysis. Empagliflozin significantly reduced the incidence of AKI (20% vs 66.7%; absolute difference 46.7%, 95% CI, –69.7 – –23.6; P=.001). Following surgery, urinary NGAL, and KIM-1 were found to increase in both arms, whereas a significant increment in serum HIF-1α after surgery was solely observed in the control group. We observed no between-group differences in the incidence of (euglycemic) ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic events.Conclusions Perioperative SGLT2 inhibition, compared with standard of care, significantly reduced the incidence of CSA-AKI. These findings warrant validation in large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials.Trial Registry https://onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/26563 Identifier: NL9561In this open-label, randomized, controlled, pilot trial perioperative use of sodium glucose transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition with empagliflozin significantly reduced the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) by 46.7% (95% CI, –69.7 – –23.6; P=.001) compared to the control group.The level of ketone bodies increased significantly during cardiac surgery, however, there was no additional effect of empagliflozin treatment.These results suggest that perioperative treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors might decrease the risk of cardiac surgery-associated (CSA)-AKI.These findings warrant validation in large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, which is currently ongoing."

This paper examined and compared strategies implemented by six Canadian provinces to increase access and promote the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among selected priority populations. We also explored the factors that impacted the implementation of these strategies.Methods In six provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec), we conducted an environmental scan of provincial rollout documents and media sources reporting vaccine distribution among selected priority populations: First Nations, Inuit, and Metis; Black communities; essential workers; people experiencing homelessness; and people with disabilities. We subsequently interviewed 39 key informants to validate the environmental scan results, identify additional strategies to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake, and uncover perceptions of the facilitators and challenges that influenced the strategies’ implementation.Results Through the environmental scans and key informant interviews, we identified that provincial health authorities employed a panoply of strategies to overcome geographic, financial, and attitudinal barriers to COVID-19 vaccines experienced by the priority populations. Most provinces implemented walk-in, mobile, and pop-up vaccination clinics, mobilized public and private health workforce, and designed multilingual communication materials. Facilitators in implementing COVID-19 vaccination strategies included fostering inter-governmental cooperation, harmonizing communication efforts, leveraging existing relationships and networks, and ensuring representation and leadership of community partners. Challenges to implementing COVID-19 vaccination strategies included uncoordinated communication efforts, inadequate distribution of vaccines to areas with the greatest need, mistrust in the government and healthcare system, vaccine hesitancy, and lack of cultural competence by vaccine providers.Conclusions This study highlights the divide between well-intentioned strategies and interventions and the reality of on-the-ground implementation. The findings offer valuable insights and can inform the implementation of strategies to distribute vaccines equitably in future large-scale vaccination efforts in Canada and globally."

There is growing evidence of the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms for stroke risk prediction models.Aims A systematic review was conducted to identify and comprehensively evaluate the available evidence.Summary of review Relevant studies were identified from the three electronic databases (i) MEDLINE via Pubmed, (ii) Scopus, and (iii) IEEE Xplore from inception to 1st December 2020. Out of 12,626 studies identified, 40 used machine learning for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke risk prediction models. Synthesis without meta-analysis identified that a boosting algorithm (median C-statistics = 0.9 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.88-0.92)), and neural network (median C-statistic = 0.80 (IQR: 0.77-0.92)) performed best among ML models in the low risk of bias studies. Moreover, a boosting algorithm also performed best in overall (both low and high risk of bias) studies (median C-statistic = 0.92 (IQR: 0.90-0.95)).Conclusions The systematic review found promising results of the ML algorithm model performances compare with the gold standard conventional models, such as FSRP (C-statistic 0.653) and revised FSRP (C-statistic 0.716). In term of the algorithm, boosting and neural networks are robust, but are considered as black-box models, since they are composed of non-linearity and complex algorithms. It remains questionable whether a physician would adapt these algorithms to use in a real clinical setting. Moreover, less than half of the studies (16 out of 40) were at low risk of bias in our systematic review. More researches with good methodology and study design, alongside explainable and good performance models, may become available in the future.Trial Registration Information The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (ID: CRD42021234081)."

Conformal prediction as a robust uncertainty quantification framework has been receiving increasing attention as a valuable tool in improving model trustability. An area of active research is the method of non-conformity score calculation for conformal prediction.Method We propose deep conformal supervision (DCS) which leverages the intermediate outputs of deep supervision for non-conformity score calculation, via weighted averaging based on the inverse of mean calibration error for each stage. We benchmarked our method on two publicly available datasets focused on medical image classification; a pneumonia chest radiography dataset and a preprocessed version of the 2019 RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage dataset.Results Our method achieved mean coverage errors of 16e-4 (CI: le-4, 41e-4) and 5e-4 (CI: le-4, 10e-4) compared to baseline mean coverage errors of 28e-4 (CI: 2e-4, 64e-4) and 21e-4 (CI: 8e-4, 3e-4) on the two datasets, respectively.Conclusion In this non-inferiority study, we observed that the baseline results of conformal prediction already exhibit small coverage errors. Our method shows a relative enhancement, particularly noticeable in scenarios involving smaller datasets or when considering smaller acceptable error levels, although this improvement is not statistically significant."

Data gathered from hospital networks globally by pharmaceutical industries to monitor antibiotic efficacy in different bacteria represent an additional source to track the temporal evolution of AMR. Here, we analysed available industry monitoring systems to assess to which extent combining them could help fill the gaps in our current understanding of AMR levels and trends.Methods We analysed six industry monitoring systems (ATLAS, GEARS, SIDERO-WT, KEYSTONE, DREAM, and SOAR) obtained from the Vivli platform and reviewed their respective isolates collection and analysis protocols. Using the R software, we designed a pipeline to harmonise and combine these into a single dataset. We assessed the reliability of resistance estimates from these sources by comparing the combined dataset to the publicly available subset of WHO GLASS for shared bacteria-antibiotic-country-year combinations.Results Combined, the industry monitoring systems cover 18 years (4 years for GLASS), 85 countries (71), 412 bacterial species (8), and 75 antibiotics (25). Although all industry systems followed a similar centralised testing approach, the criteria for isolate collection were unclear (patients selection, associated sampling periods…). For E.coli, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus, at least 65% of comparable resistance proportions were within 0.1 of the corresponding estimate in GLASS. We did not identify systemic bias towards resistance in industry systems compared to GLASS.Conclusions Combining industry monitoring systems can substantially strengthen our knowledge of global AMR burden across bacterial species and countries. High agreement values for available comparisons with GLASS suggest that data for other bacteria-antibiotic-country-year combinations only present in industry systems could complement GLASS, particularly for Priority Pathogens currently not covered. This valuable information on resistance levels could help clinicians and stakeholders prioritize testing and select appropriate antibiotics in settings with limited surveillance data.Plain language summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing problem worldwide, but we don’t always have enough information to fully understand its extent and how it’s changing over time. In this study, we looked at data collected by pharmaceutical companies from hospitals around the world to see how well antibiotics are working against different bacteria. We wanted to see if combining these data sources could help us fill in gaps in global AMR surveillance. We reviewed the methods of six different systems that collect this data and developed an approach to combine them. Then, we compared this combined data to publicly available GLASS data from the WHO to check if it was reliable. We found that the data from the pharmaceutical companies covered more years, countries, bacterial species, and antibiotics than GLASS. Even though the way the data was collected by the companies wasn’t always clear, we saw that the resistance estimates were similar to those from GLASS for some common bacteria like E.coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Overall, combining data from these different sources could improve our understanding of AMR worldwide, especially in places where surveillance is currently limited, and for Priority Pathogens not covered by GLASS."

Prognosis factors and survival in very long-term follow-up have not been reported in HF. HF disease management programs(DMP) results are contradictory. DMP efficacy in very long-term follow-up is unknown. We studied the very long-term follow-up of up to 23.6 years and prognostic factors of HF in 412 patients under GDMT included in the REMADHE trial.Methods The REMADHE trial was a prospective, single-center, randomized trial comparing DMP versus usual care(C). The first patient was randomized on October 5, 1999. The primary outcome of this extended REMADHE was all-cause mortality.Results The all-cause mortality rate was 88.3%. HF was the first cause of death followed by death at home. Mortality was higher in the first 6-year follow-up. The predictive variables in multivariate analysis associated with mortality were age ≥52 years (P=0.015), Chagas etiology (P=0.010), LVEF <45% (P=0.008), use of digoxin (P=0.002), functional class IV (P=0.01), increase in urea (P=0.03), and reduction of lymphocytes (P=0.005). In very long-term follow-up, DMP did not affect mortality in patients under GDMT. HF as a cause of death was more frequent in the C group. Chagas disease, LVEF <45%, and renal function were associated with different modes of death.Conclusion DMP was not effective in reducing very-long term mortality; however, the causes of death had changed. Our findings that age, LVEF, Chagas’ disease, functional class, renal function, lymphocytes, and digoxin use were associated with poor prognosis could influence future strategies to improve HF management."

Protocol for a mixed method systematic review on patient-relevant benefits and harms of algorithmic decision-making,"AbstractBackground Algorithmic decision making (ADM) utilizes algorithms to collect and process data and develop models to make or support decisions. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of support systems that can be superior to medical professionals without AI support in certain tasks. However, whether patients can benefit from this remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the current evidence on patient-relevant benefits and harms when healthcare professionals use ADM systems (developed using or working with AI) compared to healthcare professionals without AI-related ADM (standard care) - regardless of the clinical issues. Furthermore, for interpreting collected evidence and analysing preconditions for the implementation of AI-related ADM in healthcare, experts from research, practice, and regulation will be interviewed.Methods Following the PRISMA statement and the MECIR standards for reporting systematic reviews, MEDLINE and PubMed (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Elsevier), IEEE Xplore, CENTRAL will be searched using English free text terms in title/abstract, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and Embase Subject Headings (Emtree) fields. Additional studies will be identified by contacting authors of included studies and through reference lists of included studies. Grey literature searches will be conducted in Google Scholar. Risk of bias will be assessed by using Cochrane’s RoB 2 for randomised trials and ROBINS-I for non-randomised trials. Transparent reporting of the included studies will be assessed using the CONSORT-AI extension statement. Following the SRQR statement, semi-structured interviews will be conducted and analysed with the help of a qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. Based on the research questions and the findings of the systematic review, the study and interview guide will be developed a priori.Discussion It is expected that there will be a substantial shortage of suitable studies that compare healthcare professionals with and without ADM systems concerning patient-relevant endpoints. This can be attributed to the prioritization of technical quality criteria and, in some cases, clinical parameters over patient-relevant endpoints in the development of study designs. Furthermore, it is anticipated that a significant portion of the identified studies will exhibit relatively poor methodological quality and provide only limited generalizable results.Systematic review registration This study is registered within Prospero (CRD42023412156)."

The intervention was weekly oral doses of 14,000 IU vitamin D3 (n=4418) or placebo (n=4433) for 3 years. Outcome measures were grip strength, standing long jump distance and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations (determined in all participants), peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak, determined in a subset of 632 participants using 20-metre multi-stage shuttle run tests) and spirometric outcomes (determined in a subset of 1,343 participants).Results 99.8% of participants had serum 25(OH)D concentrations <75 nmol/L at baseline, and mean end-study 25(OH)D concentrations in children randomised to vitamin D vs. placebo were 77.4 vs. 26.7 nmol/L (mean difference 50.7 nmol/L, 95% CI, 49.7 to 51.4). However, vitamin D supplementation did not influence mean grip strength, standing long jump distance, VO2peak, spirometric lung volumes or peak expiratory flow rate, either overall or within sub-groups defined by sex, baseline 25(OH)D concentration <25 vs. ≥25 nmol/L or calcium intake <500 vs. ≥500 mg/day.Conclusion A 3-year course of weekly oral supplementation with 14,000 IU vitamin D3 elevated serum 25(OH)D concentrations in Mongolian schoolchildren with a high baseline prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. However, this intervention did not influence grip strength, explosive leg power, peak oxygen uptake or spirometric lung volumes, either overall or in sub-group analyses.KEY MESSAGES What is already known on this topic?Observational studies have reported that vitamin D deficiency associates with reduced muscle strength and peak oxygen uptake in children, but randomised controlled trials (RCT) of vitamin D supplementation to improve grip strength and cardiorespiratory fitness in this age-group have yielded conflicting results.What this study addsThis Phase 3 multicentre RCT of vitamin D supplementation, conducted in Mongolian schoolchildren with a high baseline prevalence of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency, found that a 3-year course of weekly oral supplementation with 14,000 IU vitamin D3 was effective in elevating serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. However this intervention did not influence participants’ grip strength, long jump distance, peak oxygen uptake, spirometric lung volumes or peak expiratory flow rate, either overall or in sub-group analyses.How this study might affect research, practice or policyTaken together with results from another Phase 3 randomised controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation conducted in South African children, our findings do not suggest a role for weekly oral vitamin D supplementation to enhance muscle strength, peak oxygen uptake or respiratory function in schoolchildren in whom rickets has been excluded."

Features were manually annotated by six graders in a subset of patients based on a defined grading protocol to produce segmentation masks to train an AI model, AIRDetect, which was then applied to the entire imaging dataset.Main Outcome Measures Quantitative FAF imaging features including area in mm2 and vessel metrics, were analysed cross-sectionally by gene and age, and longitudinally to determine rate of progression. AIRDetect feature segmentation and detection were validated with Dice score and precision/recall, respectively.Results A total of 45,749 FAF images from 3,606 IRD patients from MEH covering 170 genes were automatically segmented using AIRDetect. Model-grader Dice scores for disc, hypo-AF, hyper-AF, ring and vessels were respectively 0.86, 0.72, 0.69, 0.68 and 0.65. The five genes with the largest hypo-AF areas were CHM, ABCC6, ABCA4, RDH12, and RPE65, with mean per-patient areas of 41.5, 30.0, 21.9, 21.4, and 15.1 mm2. The five genes with the largest hyper-AF areas were BEST1, CDH23, RDH12, MYO7A, and NR2E3, with mean areas of 0.49, 0.45, 0.44, 0.39, and 0.34 mm2 respectively. The five genes with largest ring areas were CDH23, NR2E3, CRX, EYS and MYO7A, with mean areas of 3.63, 3.32, 2.84, 2.39, and 2.16 mm2. Vessel density was found to be highest in EFEMP1, BEST1, TIMP3, RS1, and PRPH2 (10.6%, 10.3%, 9.8%, 9.7%, 8.9%) and was lower in Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) and Leber Congenital Amaurosis genes. Longitudinal analysis of decreasing ring area in four RP genes (RPGR, USH2A, RHO, EYS) found EYS to be the fastest progressor at -0.18 mm2/year.Conclusions We have conducted the first large-scale cross-sectional and longitudinal quantitative analysis of FAF features across a diverse range of IRDs using a novel AI approach."

Cytokine concentrations were analyzed in serial blood samples collected before and after (up to two weeks) surgery, using Luminex bead arrays. After data preparation, relationships between pre- and post-surgical cytokine concentrations with acute (% time in moderate-severe pain over POD0-2) and chronic (pain score>3/10 beyond 3 months post-surgery) pain were analyzed. After adjusting for covariates, univariate/multivariate regression analyses were conducted to associate baseline cytokine concentrations with postoperative pain, and mixed effects models were used to associate longitudinal cytokine concentrations with pain outcomes.Main Results Analyses included 3,164 measures of 16 cytokines from 112 subjects (median age 15.3, IQR 13.5-17.0, 54.5% female, 59.8% pectus). Acute postsurgical pain was associated with higher baseline concentrations of GM-CSF (β=0.95, SE 0.31; p=.003), IL-1β (β=0.84, SE 0.36; p=.02), IL-2 (β=0.78, SE 0.34; p=.03), and IL-12 p70 (β=0.88, SE 0.40; p=.03) and longitudinal postoperative elevations in GM-CSF (β=1.38, SE 0.57; p=.03), IFNγ (β=1.36, SE 0.6; p=.03), IL-1β (β=1.25, SE 0.59; p=.03), IL-7 (β=1.65, SE 0.7, p=.02), and IL-12 p70 (β=1.17, SE 0.58; p=.04). In contrast, CPSP was associated with lower baseline concentration of IL-8 (β= -0.39, SE 0.17; p=.02), and the risk of developing CPSP was elevated in patients with lower longitudinal postoperative concentrations of IL-6 (β= -0.57, SE 0.26; p=.03), IL-8 (β= - 0.68, SE 0.24; p=.006), and IL-13 (β= -0.48, SE 0.22; p=.03). Furthermore, higher odds for CPSP were found for females (vs. males) for IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFα, and for pectus (vs. spine) surgery for IL-8 and IL-10.Conclusion We identified pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with increased acute postoperative pain and anti-inflammatory cytokines associated with lower CPSP risk, with potential to serve as predictive and prognostic biomarkers."

They also increase susceptibility to bacterial infections driving antibiotic use. Post-market clinical studies have questioned the efficacy of most over the counter (OTC) cough and cold ingredients against placebo in treating various symptoms. To our knowledge, only aspirin significantly improved overall illness severity compared to placebo and that was by about 25-30%. In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial involving 157 participants, we sought to determine whether a throat spray containing a mucosal immune complex (MIC) (comprised of lysozyme, lactoferrin, and aloe) can increase the hereto reported efficacy of aspirin at reducing common cold symptoms. Previously published reports showed that the MIC can protect respiratory epithelia and lower inflammatory cytokines. Participants self-administered treatments (throat sprays every hour and tablets every four hours) and completed surveys at home over two days. Treatments included MIC spray mixed with 6mg aspirin + placebo tablet (Treatment 1), MIC spray + placebo tablet (Treatment 2), MIC spray + 325 mg aspirin tablet (Treatment 3). Participants included adult volunteers ages 21-66 (average 44), 54% female, 46% male, 46% African American, 8% Asian, 39% Caucasian, and 7% Hispanic, having common cold symptoms lasting less than two days. The main outcome measures included Sore Throat Pain Intensity (STPIS) 0-100 at 36 hours (primary endpoint) and Modified Jackson Score (MJS), a combination of eight cold symptoms (secondary endpoint).Both primary and secondary endpoints were met. Sore throat pain as measured by STPIS decreased 68-75% by 36 hours depending on treatment. Other symptoms such as nasal discharge, congestion, sneezing, cough, sore throat, and malaise as measured by MJS decreased 38-68% depending on treatment. In repeated measure within group analysis observing the same participants over multiple time points; STPIS mean change from baseline to 36 hours was as follows: Placebo (-7.84 (-14%) [95% CI -14.20 to -1.47]; p<0.0001), Treatment 1 (-42.41 (-75%)[95% CI -48.30 to -36.52]; p<0.0001), Treatment 2 (-38.60 (-68%)[95% CI -46.64 to -31.56]; p<0.0001), and Treatment 3 (-44.19 (-79%) [95% CI -52.11to -36.27]; p<0.0001). In repeated measure within group analysis all treatments significantly reduced cold symptom severity (MJS) from Days 1-2. Results were as follows: Treatment 1 (-2.26 (-38%) [95% CI -3.04 --1.47] p<0.0001), Treatment 2 (-3.81 (-53%) [95% CI -4.82 - -2.80] p<0.0001), Treatment 3 (-4.49 (-69%) [95% CI -5.62- -3.57]; p<0.0001).As a result of this study, we conclude that supporting upper respiratory epithelia and reducing COX-mediated inflammation may be used to effectively treat common cold symptoms.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06106880Posted 30/10/2023"

One promising method is strategic scoring (Oetting et al., 2016), which has good clinical utility for identifying language impairment in nonautistic school-age children across dialects of English. This report applies strategic scoring to analyze sentence repetition and sentence production in autistic adolescents and adults.Method Thirty-one diverse autistic adolescents and adults with language impairment (ALI; n=15) and without language impairment (ASD; n=16) completed the Formulated Sentences and Recalling Sentences subtests of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-5th Ed (Wiig et al., 2013). Descriptive analyses and regression evaluated effects of scoring condition, group, and scoring condition by group on outcomes, as well as group differences in finiteness-marking across utterances and morphosyntactic structures.Results Strategic and unmodified item-level scores were essentially constant on both subtests and significantly lower in the ALI than the ASD group. Only group predicted item-level scores. Group differences were limited to: percent grammatical utterances on Formulated Sentences and percent production of overt structures combined on Sentence Repetition (ALI < ASD).Discussion Findings support the feasibility of strategic scoring for sentence production and sentence repetition to identify language impairment and indicate that potential dialectal variation in finiteness-marking did not confound outcomes in this sample. To better understand the clinical utility of strategic scoring, replication with a larger sample varying in age and comparisons with dialect-sensitive measures are needed."

Generalized additive models for location, scale and shape were used to estimate anthropometric-related, i.e. body mass and height, TD percentile curves and to convert outcomes of individual patients with CP and DMD into z-scores.Results Muscle size and strength, as well as their inter-subject variation, increased with increasing anthropometric values. Individual patients exhibited negative z-scores, indicating muscle size and strength deficits in reference to TD peers.Interpretation The established anthropometric-related percentile curves for muscle size and strength in a cohort of TD children can successfully be used to express patient outcomes in reference to TD. This facilitates the interpretation of muscle size and weakness in children with a motor disability and allows for the evaluation of the disease progression and treatment impact during growth."

Deep learning can improve identification of these patients.Methods This retrospective study examined adult heart failure patients admitted to a tertiary care institution between January 2009 and December 2018. A deep learning model was constructed with a dense input layer, three long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, and a dense hidden layer to cohesively extract features from time-series and non-time-series EHR data. Primary outcomes were all-cause hospital readmission or death within 30 days after hospital discharge.Results Among a final subset of 49,675 heart failure patients, we identified 171,563 hospital admissions described by 330 million EHR data points. There were 22,111 (13%) admissions followed by adverse 30-day outcomes, including 19,122 readmissions (87%) and mortality in 3,330 patients (15%). Our final deep learning model achieved an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.613 and precision-recall (PR) AUC of 0.38.Conclusions This EHR-based deep learning model developed from a decade of heart failure care achieved marginal clinical accuracy in predicting very early hospital readmission or death despite previous accurate prediction of 1-year mortality in this large study cohort. These findings suggest that factors unavailable in standard EHR data play pivotal roles in influencing early hospital readmission.What is new?We developed an EHR-based deep learning model trained by 330 million data points from one of the largest cohorts of heart failure patients to date. Despite this model’s highly accurate prediction of long-term outcomes, such as mortality and disease progression, our findings suggest that EHR data alone offers limited predictive power for predicting the short-term outcomes of 30-day hospital readmission or death.What are the clinical implications?Our study supports the notion that hospital readmission, in contrast to other health outcomes, is uniquely driven by additional factors beyond traditional EHR variables. Once identified, incorporation of these determinants into future deep learning models could allow for accurate heart failure risk-stratification at hospital discharge to facilitate more efficient allocation of limited resources to the most vulnerable patients."

However, the precise impact of dynamic DNA methylation alterations on immunological responses after BCG vaccination remains inadequately elucidated. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive study by integrating longitudinal analysis and systems biology approaches. We established a cohort of 284 healthy Dutch individuals, capturing data on genetics, cytokine responses to ex vivo stimulation and genome-wide DNA methylation at baseline, as well as at 14 days and 90 days after BCG vaccination. Our findings revealed distinct patterns of DNA methylation alternations in the short- and long-term following BCG vaccination. Moreover, we established that baseline DNA methylation profiles exert influence on the change in interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production upon heterologous (Staphylococcus aureus) stimulation before and after BCG vaccination. Specifically, we identified the regulation of kisspeptin as a novel pathway implicated in the modulation of IFN-γ production, and this finding has been substantiated through experiment validation. We also observed associations between BCG-induced DNA methylation changes and increased IFN-γ and Interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) production upon S. aureus stimulation. Interestingly, by integrating with genetic, epigenetic, and cytokine response data from the same individuals, mediation analysis demonstrated that most of the identified DNA methylation changes played a mediating role between genetic variants and cytokine responses, for example, the changes of cg21375332 near SLC12A3 gene mediated the regulation of genetic variants on IFN-γ changes after BCG vaccination. Sex-specific effects consistently manifested in DNA methylation changes after BCG vaccination and in the association between baseline methylation and cytokine responses. Together, our findings provide deeper insights into immune response mechanisms, crucial for developing effective epigenetic-based medical interventions for personalized medicine."

We monitored wastewater and clinic patients for the presence of respiratory viruses on a large, public university campus. Campus sewer systems were monitored in 16 locations for the presence of viruses using next generation sequencing over 22 weeks in 2023. During this period, we detected a surge in human adenovirus (HAdV) levels in wastewater. Hence, we initiated clinical surveillance at an on-campus clinic from patients presenting with acute respiratory infection. From whole genome sequencing of 123 throat and/or nasal swabs collected, we identified an outbreak of HAdV, specifically of HAdV-E4 and HAdV-B7 genotypes overlapping in time. The temporal dynamics and proportions of HAdV genotypes found in wastewater were corroborated in clinical infections. We tracked specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in clinical virus sequences and showed that they arose in wastewater signals concordant with the time of clinical presentation, linking community transmission of HAdV to the outbreak. This study demonstrates how wastewater-based epidemiology can be integrated with surveillance at ambulatory healthcare settings to monitor areas prone to respiratory virus outbreaks and provide public health guidance.Download figureOpen in new tab"

Traditional paper-based questionnaires, while widely used, present challenges in terms of cost, accuracy, and completeness of data entry into Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This study investigates the application of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically document understanding models and large language models (LLMs), to automate the transformation of paper-based SDoH questionnaires into structured, machine-readable formats suitable for EHR integration. Utilizing a test dataset derived from the Cambridge Health Alliance SDoH questionnaire, available in eight languages, this study explored the feasibility of using Microsoft Azure Document Intelligence and OpenAI’s GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, which were selected for their advanced capabilities in document understanding and language processing, respectively, for this purpose. The findings show that GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 Turbo across various metrics, including accuracy and consistency, albeit at a higher cost. This feasibility study highlights the potential of using AI as a relatively accurate and potentially cost-effective alternative to manual data entry of SDoH data collected using paper-based questionnaires. It also suggests there will be challenges such as data privacy and security considerations as well as the integration of AI-generated data into EHR systems that merit further research."

We therefore sought to understand the health and economic impacts of the molecular diagnostic programme in South Africa, to deepen the understanding on the broad value of diagnostics and guide future healthcare investments. We calculated the 10-year (where data were available) total cost and DALYs averted associated with molecular diagnosis of molecular TB testing (2013-2022), HIV viral load monitoring (2013-2022), early infant diagnosis of HIV infection (2013-2022), and SARS-CoV-2 testing (2020-2022). We then calculated the economic value associated with those health gains and subsequent return on investment. Since the inception of the molecular diagnostics programme in South Africa, 3,035,782 DALYs have been averted as a direct consequence of this programme. This has generated an estimated $20.5 billion in economic value due to these health gains. The return on investment varied by specific diagnostic test (19.0 for tuberculosis, 1.4 for HIV viral load testing, 64.8 for early infant diagnosis of HIV, and 2.5 for SARS-CoV-2), for an average of 9.9 for the entire molecular diagnostics programme between 2013 and 2022- or $9.9 of value for each $1 invested. The molecular diagnostics programme in South Africa generated a significant amount of health gains and economic value associated with these health gains, and the return-on-investment rivals other high-impact public health interventions such as childhood vaccination. Consequently, the molecular diagnostics programme in South Africa is highly impactful, and will continue to be an excellent investment of South African public health expenditure."

Literature shows that depression is associated with abnormal brain structure, and that socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with depression and brain structure. However, limited research considers the interaction between each of these factors.Methods Multivariate regression analysis was conducted using UK Biobank data on 39,995 participants to examine the relationship between depression and brain volume in 23 cortical regions for the whole sample and then separated by sex. It then examined whether SES affected this relationship.Results Eight out of 23 brain areas had significant negative associations with depression in the whole population. However, these relationships were diminished in seven areas when SES was included in the analysis. For females, three regions had significant negative associations with depression when SES was not included, but only one when it was. For males, lower volume in six regions was significantly associated with higher depression without SES, but this relationship was abolished in four regions when SES was included. The precentral gyrus was robustly associated with depression across all analyses.Limitations Participants with conditions that could affect the brain were not excluded. UK Biobank is not representative of the general population which may limit generalisability. SES was made up of education and income which were not considered separately.Conclusions SES affects the relationship between depression and cortical brain volume. Health practitioners and researchers should consider this when working with imaging data in these populations."

Genome-wide association studies investigating lithium response have identified several relevant loci, though the precise mechanisms driving these associations are poorly understood. We aimed to prioritise the most likely effector gene and determine the mechanisms underlying an intergenic lithium response locus on chromosome 21 identified by the International Consortium of Lithium Genetics (ConLi+Gen).Methods We conducted in-silico functional analyses by integrating and synthesising information from several publicly available functional genetic datasets and databases including the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and HaploReg.Results The findings from this study highlighted TMPRSS15 as the most likely effector gene at the ConLi+Gen lithium response locus. TMPRSS15 encodes enterokinase, a gastrointestinal enzyme responsible for converting trypsinogen into trypsin and thus aiding digestion. Convergent findings from gene-based lookups in human and mouse databases as well as co-expression network analyses of small intestinal RNA-seq data (GTEx) implicated TMPRSS15 in the regulation of intestinal nutrient absorption, including ions like sodium and potassium, which may extend to lithium.Limitations Although the findings from this study indicated that TMPRSS15 was the most likely effector gene at the ConLi+Gen lithium response locus, the evidence was circumstantial. Thus, the conclusions from this study need to be validated in appropriately designed wet-lab studies.Conclusions The findings from this study are consistent with a model whereby TMPRSS15 impacts the efficacy of lithium treatment in patients with bipolar disorder by modulating intestinal lithium absorption."

We selected a sub-cohort that followed a vegan and an omnivore diet (N=36) to validate the effect of diet on adipose tissue. In the wider imaging cohort, we examined the relationship between adipose tissue FA composition and various traits related to disease and body size.Results We measured adipose tissue FA composition for over 33,000 participants, revealing higher fSFA and fPUFA and lower fMUFA in VAT (p < 0.00016). fMUFA and fPUFA were higher in ASAT and lower in VAT for women (p<0.00016). Vegans exhibited lower fSFA in both ASAT and VAT (p < 0.00016). VAT fSFA and fMUFA showed significant associations with disease as well as anthropometric variables.Discussion This extensive analysis revealed the relationships between adipose tissue FA composition and a range of factors in a diverse population, highlighting the importance of studying body adipose tissue beyond its quantity.What is already known?The fatty acid (FA) composition of adipose tissue is an independent risk factor for hypertension, type-2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease.There has yet to be a large-scale population study of adipose tissue FA composition, principally due to the invasive nature of available methods.What does the study add?We show that MRI-based methods can be readily applied across a large population (n=33,823) while confirming and expanding on the associations between dietary patterns and FA composition in both abdominal subcutaneous (ASAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue.Models involving saturated and monounsaturated FA composition in VAT demonstrate significant association with disease outcomes, anthropometric variables, dietary macronutrient intake and physical activity.How might these results change the direction of research or the focus of clinical practice?Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating adipose tissue composition and its relationship with dietary and disease traits.These insights will contribute to formulating more informed lifestyle recommendations to alleviate or even reverse metabolic conditions associated with obesity."

Upon ART cessation, virus rapidly rebounds from latently-infected cells (“the HIV reservoir”). The reservoir is largely stabilized at the time of ART initiation and then decays slowly. Here, leveraging >500 longitudinal samples from 67 people with HIV (PWH) treated during acute infection, we developed a novel mathematical model to predict reservoir decay using the intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) from peripheral CD4+ T cells. Nonlinear generalized additive models adjusted for initial CD4+ T count, pre-ART viral load, and timing of ART initiation demonstrated rapid biphasic decay of intact DNA (week 0-5: t1/2 ∼0.71 months; week 5-24: t1/2 ∼3.9 months) that extended out to 1 year of ART, with similar trends for defective DNA. Predicted reservoir decay were faster for participants individuals with earlier timing of ART initiation, higher initial CD4+ T cell count, and lower pre-ART viral load. These estimates are ∼5-fold faster than prior reservoir decay estimates among chronic-treated PWH. Thus, these data add to our limited understanding of host viral control at the earliest stages of HIV reservoir stabilization, potentially informing future HIV cure efforts aimed at diverse, global population of PWH initiating ART at varying stages of disease."

To overcome this challenge, we develop a diverse set of statistical, machine learning and deep learning approaches to forecast influenza activity in Hong Kong 0-to 8- week ahead, leveraging a unique multi-year surveillance record spanning 34 winter and summer epidemics from 1998-2019. We develop a simple average ensemble (SAE), which is the average of individual forecasts from the top three individual models. We also consider an adaptive weight blending ensemble (AWBE) that allows for dynamic updates of each model contribution based on LASSO regression and uses decaying weights in historical data to capture rapid change in influenza activity. Overall, across all 9 weeks of horizon, all models outperform the baseline constant incidence model, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 23%-29% and weighted interval score (WIS) by 25%-31%. The SAE ensemble only slightly better than individual models, reducing RMSE and WIS by 29%. The AWBE ensemble reduce RMSE by 45% and WIS by 46%, and outperform individual models for forecasts of epidemic trends (growing, flat, descending), and during both winter and summer seasons. Using the post-COVID surveillance data in 2023-2024 as another test period, the AWBE ensemble still reduces RMSE by 32% and WIS by 36%. Our framework contributes to the ensemble forecasting of infectious diseases with irregular seasonality.Significance statement In subtropical and tropical regions, irregular influenza seasonality makes accurate forecasting challenging. We test ensemble approaches using diverse statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models based on a unique multi-year surveillance record in Hong Kong. Performance of individual models varies by season and epidemic trend, but simple averaging ensemble cannot improve accuracy. Here we develop an adaptive weight ensemble approach, which updated individual model contributions dynamically. This approach halves the RMSE, outperforms all individual models in different settings and reducing RMSE by one-third even in post-COVID periods. Our method contributes to comparison and benchmarking of models in ensemble forecasts, enhancing the evidence base for synthesizing multiple models in disease forecasting in geographies with irregular influenza seasonality."

In this study, we propose an innovative interpretable population graph network framework for identifying rapid progressors of AD by utilizing patient information from electronic health-related records in the UK Biobank. To achieve this, we first created a patient similarity graph, in which each AD patient is represented as a node; and an edge is established by patient clinical characteristics distance. We used graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict rapid progressors of AD and created a GNN Explainer with SHAP analysis for interpretability. The proposed model demonstrates superior predictive performance over the existing benchmark approaches. We also revealed several clinical features significantly associated with the prediction, which can be used to aid in effective interventions for the progression of AD patients."

The emergence of clonal hypervirulent strains often resistant to last-resort antimicrobial agents has become a global burden as treatment options are limited. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has a dynamic and diverse population and serves as a major global tourist hub facilitating the dissemination of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of K. pneumoniae. To examine the spread of clinically relevant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, we characterized the population structure and dynamics of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae across the KSA hospitals.Methods We conducted a large genomic survey on a Saudi Arabian collection of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from bloodstream and urinary tract infections. The isolates were collected from 32 hospitals located in 15 major cities across the country in 2022 and 2023. We subjected 352 K. pneumoniae isolates to whole-genome sequencing and employed a broad range of genomic epidemiological and phylodynamic methods to analyse population structure and dynamics at high resolution. We employed an integrated short- and long-read sequencing approach to fully characterize multiple plasmids carrying resistance and virulence genes.Results Our results indicate that, despite a diverse K. pneumoniae population underlying hospital infections, the population is characterized by the rapid expansion of a few dominant clones, including ST096 (n=115), ST147 (n=75), ST231 (n=35), ST101 (n=30), ST11 (n=18), ST16 (n=15) and ST14 (n=12). ST2096, ST231, and ST147 clones were estimated to have formed within the past two decades and spread between hospitals across the country on an epidemiological time scale. All STs were genetically linked with globally circulating clones, particularly strains from the Middle East and South Asia. All of the major clones harboured plasmid-borne ESBLs and a range of carbapenemase genes. Plasmidome analysis revealed multiple mosaic plasmids with resistance and virulence gene cassettes, some of which were shared between the major clades and account for multidrug resistant hypervirulent (MDR/hv) phenotype, especially in the ST2096 strains. Integration of phylodynamic data and resistance plasmid profiles showed that the acquisition of plasmids occurred on the same time scales as did the expansion of major clones across the country.Conclusion Taken together, these results indicate the dissemination of MDR and MDR-hv K. pneumoniae strains across the kingdom and provide evidence for pervasive plasmid sharing and horizontal gene transfer of resistance genes. The results demonstrate the independent introduction of endemic ST147, ST231, and ST101 clones into the country and highlight the clinical significance of ST2096 as an emerging clone with dual resistance and virulence risks. These results highlight the need for continuous surveillance of circulating and newly emergent strains (STs) and of their plasmidome footprints carrying MDR determinants."

We sought to improve stakeholder engagement in MDA planning and improve subsequent MDA coverage through a series of microplanning workshops.Methodology/Principal Findings Prior to the 2018 MDA, Haiti’s Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) and partners conducted 10 stakeholder microplanning workshops in metropolitan Port-au-Prince. The objectives of the workshops were to identify and address gaps in geographic coverage of supervision areas (SAs); review past MDA performance and propose strategies to improve access to MDA; and review roles and responsibilities of MDA personnel, through increased stakeholder engagement. Retrospective pre-testing was used to assess the effectiveness of the workshops. Participants used a 5-point scale to rank their understanding of past performance, SA boundaries, roles and responsibilities, and their perceived engagement by MSPP. Participants simultaneously ranked their previous year’s attitudes and their attitudes following the 2-day microplanning workshop. Changes in pre- and post-scores were analyzed using Wilcoxon-signed rank tests. A total of 356 stakeholders across five communes participated in the workshops. Participants conducted various planning activities including revising SA boundaries to ensure full geographic reach of MDA, proposing or validating social mobilization strategies, and proposing other MDA improvements. Compared with previous year rankings, the workshops increased participant understanding of past performance by 1.34 points (standard deviation [SD]=1.05, p<0.001); SA boundaries by 1.14 points (SD=1.30; p<0.001); their roles and responsibilities by 0.71 points (SD=0.95, p-<0.001); and sense of engagement by 1.03 points (SD=1.08, p<0.001). Additionally, drug coverage increased in all five communes during the 2018 MDA.Conclusions/Significance Participatory stakeholder workshops during MDA planning can increase self-reported engagement of key personnel and may improve personnel performance and contribute to achievement of drug coverage targets. Microplanning success was supported by MDA results, with all communes achieving preset MDA coverage targets.Author summary Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease that can be eliminated by treating entire at-risk communities with safe and efficacious medicines, a strategy known as mass drug administration (MDA). MDA campaigns require intense planning to ensure that every eligible person within the community can receive the medicines if they desire. We aimed to improve the campaign by better involving key MDA stakeholders such as volunteers and other important community members in the planning process, through microplanning. The participants suggested many strategies to help the campaign reach more community members, including better ways to prepare and inform that community that the campaign is happening. We invited the microplanning participants to give feedback on how this new strategy worked compared with their experiences during past campaigns. Participants reported that they felt better engaged by health authorities, and in particular, that they had more information about the results of past campaigns, where they should be distributing medicines, and their specific tasks and responsibilities during the campaign. We found that more people received medicines during the campaign that followed the microplanning workshops compared with the previous campaigns. We conclude that microplanning helped to increase the number of people who received MDA medicines."

Exposure to various hairstyling practices ranges but is often insufficient in current dermatologic textbooks and training curricula. We therefore conducted a survey to establish dermatologists understanding of hairstyling practices, particularly those that have been implicated in alopecia.Methods A 34-item anonymous, electronic survey was distributed by email to 291 board-certified dermatologists and dermatology residents across the US between August 2020 and February 2021. Responses were rated on a 10-point scale to identify physician confidence in various styling practicesResults Black providers were more confident in both the knowledge and counseling of all hair practices (chemical straightening, heat styling, braiding, weaving, and wigs) compared to non-Black providers (p <0.001), with the exception of counseling patients on hair dyes for which no significant difference was found (p=0.337). Female providers were only more likely to indicate confidence in knowledge regarding different heat styling methods and hair dyes, and counseling of heat styling methods compared to male providers (OR 15.72, p<0.001; OR 2.47, p=0.022; OR 3.78, p=0.001 respectively) across all hair practices surveyed. Overall, 63.8% of providers reported that the majority of their knowledge on hair practices was from personal experience as opposed to formal training.Limitations This survey is limited by its response rate and the inability to characterize non-responders due to anonymity.Conclusion Our study highlights educational gaps in dermatologic training on hair practices, especially those more common among Black patients. Interestingly, the majority of provider knowledge came from personal experience rather than dermatologic training emphasizing the need for formalized curricula to enhance understanding among all dermatology providers."

In this study, we assessed nationwide trends in mortality related to HF among women and focused on women 15-55 years of age in the United States from 1999 to 2020.Methods Trends in mortality related to HF were assessed through a cross-sectional analysis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiological Research database. Age-adjusted mortality rates per 1,000,000 people and associated annual percent changes with 95% Confidence Intervals(CI) were determined. Joinpoint regression was used to assess the trends in the overall, demographic (sex, race and ethnicity, age), and regional groups.Results Between 1999 and 2020, 1,035,383 women died of heart failure. The age-adjusted mortality rate remained stable from 1999-2005, saw a reduction till 2012 and then an increase till 2020. Higher mortality rates were observed for Black patients, and patients ≥55 years of age. Large metropolitan counties had lesser mortality burden compared to rural counterparts. In 15-55 age group,18,875 women died due to heart failure.The discrepancy in mortality rates was even more pronounced between races in 15-55 age group.Conclusions Following an initial period of stability, HF-related mortality in women worsened from 2012 to 2020 in the United States. Black women had higher AAMR compared with White women, with a significant geographic variation. In the premenopausal group, black women had 4 times worse AAMR compared to their white counterparts. Focus towards preventative medicine, early diagnosis, and bridging the disparities, including socioeconomic, to promote healthcare equality should be upheld."

This is because it gives an indication of the effort required to control the disease. Beyond the well-known basic reproduction number, there are two natural versions, namely the control and effective reproduction numbers. As behaviour, population immunity and viral characteristics can change with time, these reproduction numbers can vary over time and in different regions.Real world data can be complex, for example with daily variation in numbers due to weekend surveillance biases as well as natural stochastic noise. As such, in this work we consider a Generalised Additive Model to smooth real data through the explicit incorporation of day-of-the-week effects, to provide a simple measure of the time-varying growth rate associated with the data.Converting the resulting spline into an estimator for both the control and effective reproduction numbers requires assumptions on a model structure, which we here assume to be a compartmental model. The reproduction numbers calculated are based on both simulated and real world data, and are compared with estimates from an already existing tool.The derived method for estimating the time-varying reproduction number is effective, efficient and comparable to other methods. It provides a useful alternative approach, which can be included as part of a toolbox of models, that is particularly apt at smoothing out day-of-the-week effects in surveillance."

We propose an alternative distortion correction approach (multi-b RPG; mRPG) that eliminates the JIC factor by normalizing opposite-polarity EPI images across multiple b-values.Study type Retrospective.Population 163 prostate cancer patients without metallic implants.Fieldstrength/Sequence 3T diffusion-weighted sequence with EPI readout, using multiple b-values.Assessment Maps of spatial shift (distortion) were estimated from opposite-polarity EPI volumes using RPG, topup, and mRPG. The estimated spatial shifts from each method were then applied to correct the b=0s/mm2 images (both with and without JIC) and ADC maps (for which JIC is meaningless).Distortion was quantified by the Pearson correlation between opposite-polarity volumes. The distribution of correlation coefficients across all patients was examined for b=0s/mm2 images and ADC maps, before and after distortion correction by each method. The mean, median, and 10th percentile were reported for each distribution.Statistical tests Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (α=0.05) were used to assess whether correlation increased significantly after distortion correction by each method, and whether mRPG yielded a larger increase versus RPG or topup.Results Median improvement in the correlation between b=0s/mm2 volumes was significantly smaller without JIC (p<0.001): 0.04 vs 0.16 (RPG), 0.06 vs 0.18 (topup). mRPG yielded significantly larger improvements compared to RPG or topup (p<0.001). b=0s/mm2: 0.09 vs 0.04 (RPG) and 0.06 (topup). ADC: 0.09 vs 0.02 (RPG) and 0.03 (topup).Data conclusion Disparity in the distortion-correction performance of conventional methods with and without JIC suggests underestimation of tissue displacement. mRPG shows improved correction of distortion artifacts compared to conventional methods."

For some time-varying phenotypes, it has been shown that genetic effects may have differential importance in the development of an exposure at different periods in the lifecourse. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a technique that uses genetic variation to address causal questions about how modifiable exposures influence health. MR studies often employ conventional instrumental variable (IV) methods designed to estimate lifelong effects. Recently, several extensions of MR have been used to investigate time-varying effects, including structural mean models (SMMs). SMMs exploit IVs through g-estimation and circumvent some of the parametric assumptions of other MR methods.In this study, we apply g-estimation of SMMs to MR. We aim to estimate the period effects of adiposity measured at two different life stages on cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and breast cancer in later life. We found persistent period effects of higher adulthood adiposity on increased risk of CVD and T2D. Higher childhood adiposity had a protective period effect on breast cancer. We compare this method to an inverse variance weighted multivariable MR approach: a technique also using multiple IVs to assess time-varying effects, however, relying on a different set of assumptions and subsequent interpretations. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach and emphasise the importance of underlying methodological assumptions in the application of MR to lifecourse research questions."

We evaluated whether nucleic acid dyes [propidium monoazide (PMA), PEMAX] and DNaseI could reduce this. PCR [16S Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (Mtb) qPCR, Xpert MTB/RIF] was done on dilution series of untreated and treated (PMA, PEMAX, DNaseI) Mtb. Separately, 16S rRNA gene qPCR and sequencing were done on untreated and treated patients’ sputa before (Cohort A: 11 TB-negatives, 9 TB-positives; Cohort B: 19 TB-positives, PEMAX only) and after 24 weeks of chemotherapy (only Cohort B). PMA and PEMAX reduced PCR-detected Mtb DNA for both the dilution series and Cohort A sputum versus untreated controls, suggesting non-intact Mtb is present before treatment start. PEMAX enabled sequencing Mycobacterium-detection in 5/9 (59%; Cohort A) and 2/3 (67%; Cohort B week 0) TB-positive sputa where no reads otherwise occurred. In Cohort A, PMA- and PEMAX-treated versus untreated sputa had decreased α- and increased β-diversities. In Cohort B, α-diversity differences between untreated and PEMAX-treated sputa occurred only at 24-weeks and β-diversity differences between timepoints were only detected after PEMAX. DNaseI had negligible effects. PMA and PEMAX (but not DNaseI) reduced extracellular DNA, improving the proportion of Mycobacterium reads and PCR detection. PEMAX detected chemotherapy-associated changes in the microbiome otherwise missed. Our findings suggest these dyes improve characterization of the microbiome, especially chemotherapy-associated changes, and should be included in respiratory microbiome research in TB."

Evidence from cell-phone data,"AbstractBackground There is growing evidence that weather alters SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but it remains unclear what drives the phenomenon. One prevailing hypothesis is that people spend more time indoors in cooler weather, leading to increased spread of SARS-CoV-2 related to time spent in confined spaces and close contact with others. However, the evidence in support of that hypothesis is limited and, at times, conflicting.Objectives We aim to evaluate the extent to which weather impacts COVID-19 via time spent away-from-home in indoor spaces, as compared to a direct effect of weather on COVID-19 hospitalization, independent of mobility.Methods We use a mediation framework, and combine daily weather, COVID-19 hospital surveillance, cellphone-based mobility data and building footprints to estimate the relationship between daily indoor and outdoor weather conditions, mobility, and COVID-19 hospitalizations. We quantify the direct health impacts of weather on COVID-19 hospitalizations and the indirect effects of weather via time spent indoors away-from-home on COVID-19 hospitalizations within five Colorado counties between March 4th 2020 and January 31st 2021.Results We found evidence that changes in 12-day lagged hospital admissions were primarily via the direct effects of weather conditions, rather than via indirect effects by which weather changes time spent indoors away-from-home. Sensitivity analyses evaluating time at home as a mediator were consistent with these conclusions.Discussion Our findings do not support the hypothesis that weather impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission via changes in mobility patterns during the first year of the pandemic. Rather, weather appears to have impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission primarily via mechanisms other than human movement. We recommend further analysis of this phenomenon to determine whether these findings generalize to current SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and other seasonal respiratory pathogens."

This research explores the statistical relationship between Bitcoin market fluctuations and synthetic opioid mortalities, against the backdrop of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) enforcement actions.Methods Utilizing data from 2009 to 2022, this study employs Pearson correlation and linear regression models to investigate the relationship between annual Bitcoin price fluctuations and synthetic opioid-related death rates, alongside DEA domestic arrest trends.Results A pronounced positive correlation (r = 0.92) was found between Bitcoin price changes and synthetic opioid mortality rates, with the Bitcoin price accounting for approximately 84.78% of the variance in opioid-related deaths (R² = 0.8478). The analysis also notes a disparity between increasing synthetic opioid fatalities and decreasing DEA domestic arrests.Conclusions The findings reveal significant correlations between Bitcoin price fluctuations and synthetic opioid-related fatalities, highlighting potential gaps in current drug enforcement strategies. This study underscores the need for an interdisciplinary approach to address the complexities introduced by cryptocurrency in the opioid crisis and suggests the necessity of integrating financial and public health strategies to combat emerging drug abuse trends."

A Qualitative Study,"AbstractBackground Rising burnout in General Practitioners has been noted as a major issue worldwide that is contributing to many leaving the profession earlier than anticipated or reducing their hours of clinical work. Educational interventions as part of continuing professional development (CPD) have been shown to be effective in reducing burnout and improving overall wellbeing amongst GPs. There is no published evidence available describing attitudes of GPs toward such CPD-based burnout interventions. The objective of this study is to assess GPs’ perspectives and opinions towards educational CPD-based interventions aimed at improving burnout in the GP population.Methods A qualitative research approach using grounded theory methods was used. Participants were interviewed 1 to 1 via video call. Video files of the interviews were recorded and auto-transcription software used to generate a text file which was checked for accuracy of transcription. Transcripts underwent grounded thematic analysis with emergent themes synthesised and combined to develop a targeted analysis concordant with the objectives of the study. The study received ethical approval from the Swansea University Medicine, Health and Life Science Ethics Approval Board.Results 5 participants were interviewed – all were GPs listed on the GMC GP register and currently engaged in the Wales GP appraisal process. Two participants had prior experience of CPD resources focused on burnout. Participants universally noted positive sentiment towards an educational-based CPD intervention focused at reducing burnout and noted their preferences in how such an intervention might be designed. Several important perceived barriers were highlighted that would need to be considered in the design of any future interventions.Discussion Attitudes of participants suggest an educational-based CPD intervention would be well received, and further research is needed to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of such an intervention in this population."

Data included EHR (encounters, prescriptions, conditions, BMI) and medication dispensing for a collective of US healthcare systems. Eligibility required an outpatient office encounter between June 2021 and January 2024 with a BMI ≥ 27, a negative history of GLP-1 RA use, and a follow-up ≥60 days later. Patients were stratified by Medicare age eligibility (60-64 vs. 65-69) and the proportions prescribed and subsequently dispensed AOM GLP-1 RA were compared.Results In total, 413,833 AOM eligible older adults were included in our cohort, with 208,067 (50.3%) Medicare-aged adults and 205,766 (49.7%) adults aged 60-64. Among eligible patients, 0.2% of Medicare-aged patients and 0.4% of patients aged 60-64 were prescribed AOM GLP-1 RA, a significant difference (p < 0.01). Among those prescribed AOM GLP-1 RA, 15.2% of Medicare-aged patients and 22.7% of patients aged 60-64 were dispensed AOM GLP-1 RA within 60 days, a significant difference (p<0.01). In both age groups, prescribing and dispensing were more common for females and those with higher BMI.Conclusions Fewer than 1% of older adults with overweight or obesity and without T2D were prescribed an AOM GLP-1 RA. New use of GLP-1 RA was significantly lower for Medicare-aged adults, compared to 60-64-year-olds, with differences occurring at both medication prescribing and dispensing stages. While coverage of AOMs is limited by many insurers, Medicare’s unique prohibition on AOM coverage may contribute to differentially lower use among Medicare-aged adults."

We consulted with stakeholders using online workshops (one for adults with FASD [and their supporters] N=5; one for caregivers of people with FASD N=7), 1:1/small-team video calls/email communication twith clinicians, policymakers, data-governance experts, third-sector representatives, and researchers [N=35]), and one hybrid clinical workshop (N=17). Discussions covered data availability, benefits, challenges, and design preferences for a national pseudonymised linked database for FASD. We derived key themes from the notes and recordings collected across all involvement activities.Results Our tailored, multi-method approach generated high levels of stakeholder engagement. Stakeholders expressed strong support for a pseudonymised national linked database for FASD. Key anticipated benefits were the potential for: increased awareness and understanding of FASD, leading to better support; new insights into clinical profiles, leading to greater diagnostic efficiency; facilitating international collaboration; and increased knowledge of the long-term impacts of FASD on health, social care, education, economic and criminal justice outcomes. Policymakers noted clear alignment with contemporary FASD and digital transformation priorities. Given the rich data infrastructure established in the UK, stakeholders expressed that a national linked FASD database could be world-leading. Common stakeholder concerns were around privacy and data-sharing and the importance of retaining space for clinical judgement alongside insights gained from quantitative analyses.Conclusions Multi-method and multidisciplinary public and professional involvement activities demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of establishing a national linked database for FASD in the UK. Perceived benefits and challenges varied by stakeholder group, demonstrating that flexible, diverse, embedded stakeholder collaboration will be essential as we establish this database."

Frailty, a syndrome impacting the body’s ability to withstand stress, affects outcomes of alloHCT across all ages.This study examines the relationship between frailty and peri-transplant activity and sleep patterns using Fitbit® devices. In this pilot study, adults scheduled for their first myeloablative alloHCT at the University of Minnesota from June 2022 to January 2023 were included if they had a compatible device for the Fitbit® app. Participants were monitored for activity and sleep from admission to day +30 post-transplant. Frailty was assessed pre-transplant using Fried Phenotype criteria. Data were analyzed for activity and sleep patterns differences among not frail, pre-frail, and frail groups. Nine patients provided sufficient data for analysis, showing significant variances in activity levels and sleep patterns across frailty categories. Not frail patients exhibited significantly higher daily steps and active minutes than pre-frail and frail patients. Not frail patients also had the highest amount of restorative deep and rapid eye movement sleep. Due to Fitbit methodology and likely frequent interruptions, 28% of the days in the first month post-transplant had a recorded sleep time of 0 minutes. Although our sample size was small, our findings underscore the importance of frailty in influencing activity and sleep patterns among alloHCT recipients."

Although the VITAL trial did not demonstrate an overall benefit of n-3 HUFA supplementation on composite cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer outcomes, the substantial enrollment of African Americans (AfAm) afforded a unique opportunity for a post-hoc analysis of racial differences in the supplementation response. We employed propensity score matching to address potential covariate imbalances between AfAm and European American (EuAm) participants in VITAL (N=3,766 participants). Using Kaplan-Meier curves and two machine learning methodologies, we found that n-3 HUFA supplementation was significantly associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction (MI) exclusively in the AfAm subgroup, as evidenced by an odds ratio of 0.17 (95% CI [0.048, 0.59]). These findings indicate a potential cardioprotective benefit of n-3 supplementation in AfAm, specifically in reducing MI risks; a risk not identified in EuAm. Further investigation of n-3 HUFA effects through a hypothesis-driven randomized clinical trial among AfAm is needed to test a race-specific response that may inform recommendations for n-3 HUFA supplementation."

As a field that relies heavily on visual perception, many physicians consider clinical intuition to be advantageous in diagnosing skin diseases and consider it to be a rapid and unconscious phenomenon7. Therefore, too much contemplation may lead to more incorrect diagnoses4. However, while clinical intuition is a valuable clinical tool, it is widely considered to be developed throughout medical training and only successfully employed by experienced attending physicians, perhaps due to experiential knowledge and associated confidence1,2,5. One may expect that self-reported confidence in diagnosis would correlate with diagnostic accuracy, but this is not supported in the literature9. The focus of our study is to examine the development and reliability of clinical intuition as well as associated self-reported confidence levels in diagnoses at different levels of medical training among dermatologists.Methods Approximately 20 dermatologists who are PGY-2 or higher will be recruited for study participation via email. Participants will be sent a Qualtrics survey at two separate time points with a month waiting period in between. The survey will contain demographics questions, photos of 10 different dermatologic conditions for dermatologists to diagnose, and a self-reported confidence level for each diagnosis. The first survey will allow 5 seconds to evaluate a clinical photo prior to diagnosis, and this timeframe will be extended to 15 seconds in the second survey. The second survey will contain the same diagnoses, but with different pictures to avoid recall of specific photos. Following completion of all surveys, descriptive statistics will be completed with goal of publication.Discussion This study has the potential to provide invaluable information regarding the development of clinical intuition among dermatologic physicians while also examining their confidence levels and likelihood of changing correct diagnoses when given more time to ruminate. It is possible that physicians are more likely to second guess original diagnoses based off of certain demographic factors, as one systematic review found that women in medicine perceive their clinical performance as deficient more often than men10. Therefore, this study may give insight to the ways that complicated societal factors contribute to clinical decision making. Data from this study may be used to aid dermatologists in understanding their thought processes when diagnosing patients, and may be useful in developing education curriculum. The protocol will hopefully serve as a blueprint for creation of studies in a multitude of fields, ultimately leading to better understanding of clinical decision making and, thus, improved patient care."

However, EHR data sampled from different population groups can easily introduce unwanted biases, rarely permit individual-level data sharing, and make the data and fitted model hardly transferable across different population groups. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages unbalanced optimal transport to facilitate the unsupervised transfer learning of EHRs between different population groups using a model trained in an embedded feature space. Upon deriving a theoretical bound, we find that the generalization error of our method is governed by the Wasserstein distance and unbalancedness between the source and target domains, as well as their labeling divergence, which can be used as a guide for binary classification and regression tasks. Our experiments, conducted on experimental datasets from MIMIC-III database, show that our transfer learning strategy significantly outperforms standard and machine learning transfer learning methods, with respect to accuracy and computational efficiency. Upon applying our framework to predict hospital duration for populations with different insurance plans, we finally find significant disparities across groups, suggesting our method as a potential tool to assess fairness in healthcare treatment."

This article reviews the study protocol, design, methodology, ongoing data collection, analysis procedures, and demographic characteristics of the cohort enrolled.Participants Between March 2021 and May 2022, 400 participants were enrolled with a 12-month follow-up, concluding in May 2023. Two main groups of participants: (1) serologically SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals receiving the BNT162b2 primary series vaccination (referred to as VAC) and (2) those who recently recovered from COVID-19 infection within 30 days, regardless of vaccination history (referred to as COV). Additionally, a subset of 45 participants with selected COVID-19 exposure histories provided peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for cross-sectional analysis six months after enrollment.Findings to date Out of 400 participants, 66.8% (n=267) completed the follow-up. Among them, 52.8% (n=141) were in VAC, and 47.2% (n=126) were in COV. As the study progressed, we acknowledged cross-over between initial groups, leading to restructuring into five revised groups based on sequential exposure events. Sociodemographic factors revealed statistically significant age distribution differences (p=0.001) in both initial and revised groups, with no significant differences observed for sex.Future plans LONGTONG-SARS2 assesses the host-pathogen interactions central to the development of COVID-19 immunity. With enrollment spanning two years of the pandemic, most participants exhibited mixed SARS-CoV-2 exposures—via vaccination and infection—resulting in diverse subgroups of interest. Notably, the inclusion of SARS-CoV-2-naïve, pre-exposure serum samples allowed for robust comparator and reduced potential biases. Ongoing analyses will include serology kinetics, memory cells ELISpots, B cells repertoire analysis, cytokine/chemokine profiling, and proteomic pathway to comprehensively examine the immune response against the SARS-CoV-2, thus informing and potentially predicting dynamic longitudinal responses against new more transmissible, immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants.STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY- LONGTONG-SARS2 is a prospective longitudinal study that comprehensively evaluates the SARS-CoV-2 immune response among a diverse group of individuals, stratified based on the sequential order of SARS-CoV-2 exposure events, whether from COVID-19 vaccination or infection.- Pre-vaccination serum samples were collected from serologically SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals scheduled to receive the BNT162b2 primary series vaccination during the initial mass COVID-19 vaccination phase in Malaysia in early 2021.- The longitudinal serum sample collection spanned two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 2021 to May 2023. This extended duration allows for robust monitoring of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 variants in comparison to the ancestral strain.- There is a risk of misclassification of some individuals’ SARS-CoV-2 exposure status through serology, as certain sampling timepoints had intervals of three months. Additionally, our study relies on self-reported data through the MySejahtera application (Malaysia’s electronic medical record by the Ministry of Health) for second confirmation, potentially leading to underdiagnosed and underreported cases of asymptomatic infection."

To optimize trial implementation, we investigated contextual fit with key local stakeholders. We used scenario-based interviews with 17 health workers and four district managers to explore perceived feasibility. Eighteen policymakers were also surveyed to explore policy coherence, demand, acceptability, evidence needs, opportunities and risks. The Bowen feasibility framework and an access to healthcare framework were adapted and applied. Health workers perceived the MAMI Care Pathway as feasible to implement with support to access services and provide care. The approach is acceptable, given consistency with national policies, local protocols and potential to improve routine care quality. Demand for more comprehensive, preventive and person-centred outpatient care was driven by concerns about unmet, hidden and costly care burden for health services and families. Inpatient care for all severe wasting treatment is inaccessible and unacceptable. Support for routine and expanded components, especially maternal mental health, is needed for successful implementation. Wider contextual factors may affect implementation fidelity and strength. Policymakers cautiously welcomed the approach, which resonates with national commitments, policies and plans but need evidence on how it can work within varied, complex contexts without further system overstretch. A responsive, pragmatic RCT will generate the most useful evidence for policymakers. Findings have informed trial preparation and implementation, including a realist evaluation to contextualise outcomes."

The current study addressed the need for a large prospective study comparing a low-contact control group to high-contact group. Importantly, the study also expanded the scope of neurophysiological changes related to repetitive head impacts to include female athletes in addition to male athletes. In total, 89 high school student athletes underwent 231 brain vital sign scans over a full calendar year. The results replicated prior subconcussive cognitive impairments (N400 delays) and sensory impairments (N100 amplitude reductions) in male athletes and demonstrated similar subconcussive impairments for the first time in female athletes. While there was no significant subconcussive difference between female and male athletes, female athletes show overall larger responses in general. The findings demonstrated that subconcussive impairments are detectable in a controlled experimental comparison for both female and male high school athletes. The study highlights the opportunity to monitor subconcussive changes in cognitive processing for both female and male athletes to help advance prevention, mitigation and management efforts aimed at reducing athletes’ risk of potential long-term negative health outcomes related to cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts."

We aimed to assess the efficacy of 527 automated 12-lead ECG features for estimating LVEF among patients with AHF.Method Medical records of patients >18 years old and AHF-related ICD codes, demographics, LVEF %, comorbidities, and medication were analyzed. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) identified important ECG features and evaluated performance.Results Among 851 patients, the mean age was 74 years (IQR:11), male 56% (n=478), and the median body mass index was 29 kg/m2 (IQR:1.8). A total of 914 echocardiograms and ECGs were matched; the time between ECG-Echocardiogram was 9 hours (IQR of 9 hours); <30% LVEF (16.45%, n=140). Lasso demonstrated 42 ECG features important for estimating LVEF <30%. The predictive model of LVEF <30% demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86, a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.83 to 0.89, a specificity of 54% (50% to 57%), and a sensitivity of 91 (95% CI: 88% to 96%), accuracy 60% (95% CI:60 % to 63%) and, negative predictive value of 95%.Conclusions An explainable machine learning model with physiologically feasible predictors may be useful in screening patients with low LVEF in AHF.What is new?Among 527 ECG features, 42 were important in estimating <30% reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), showing the model’s high diagnostic accuracy (AUC of 0.86).The model exhibits exceptional sensitivity (91%) in predicting <30% LVEFECG-derived metrics offer the potential for early detection of reduced LVEF, especially in settings with limited advanced diagnostic tools.What are the clinical implications?Enhanced diagnostic accuracy allows for the earlier detection of reduced LVEF through ECG analysis, which is critical in an environment where an echocardiogram is unavailable.ECG features enable patient risk stratification for reduced LVEF, facilitating targeted management and optimization of healthcare resources.The findings underscore the importance of integrating ECG features into AI-based diagnostic models for rapid, accurate LVEF estimation, supporting more informed clinical decisions and enabling effective remote patient monitoring."

The study aims were to determine the suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with AEDs and potential mechanistic hypotheses.Methods Suspected ADR profiles for 8 AEDs were data-mined from the MHRA Yellow Card scheme (January 2018-August 2022) together with prescribing data from OpenPrescribing (August 2017-July 2022). The physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacology of the AEDs were data-mined from public databases.Results The suspected ADRs per 1,000,000 Rx identified across all AEDs are statistically significant (χ2 test, P < .05). Pregnancy, puerperium & perinatal conditions associated with lamotrigine (1.51 per 1,000,000 Rx, χ2 test, P < .05, d = 2.720, 95% CI [1.656, 4.469]) had a larger size effect than valproic acid (2.28 per 1,000,000 Rx, χ2 test, P < .05, d = 1.846, 95% CI [1.150, 2.964]). The large size effect associated with valproic acid for congenital and hereditary disorders (d = 9.069, 95% CI [5.807, 14.163]) and foetal exposure during pregnancy (d = 6.632, 95% CI [4.894, 8.988]) were notable amongst the AEDs. Valproic acid, a known teratogen, had the unique and clinically achievable targeting of histone deacetylase (HDAC 1 IC50 = 54.4, HDAC2 IC50 = 82.4 micromolar, HDAC3 IC50 = 148 micromolar, HDAC8 IC50 = 144 micromolar, Cmax = 184.3 micromolar) associated with teratogenicity.Significance There is renewed discussion about the management of epilepsy in pregnancy, and the risks of different AEDs. Whilst 1 in 250 women have epilepsy, they account for 1 in 10 of women who die in childbirth or postpartum. Fears about ADRs impact on adherence to medication, whilst pregnancy itself reduces the serum level of AEDs. As a result of this women are at increased risk of seizures during pregnancy and childbirth. There has been a doubling of Sudden and Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) in mothers between 2013-2015 and 2019-2021 in the UK and Ireland. The AEDs studied have diverse modes of action, and the unique polypharmacology of AEDs influences their ADR profiles. Lamotrigine had a larger size effect than valproic acid (d =2.720 vs 1.846) for suspected pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal ADRs. As noted in other studies, there is a suspected association between valproic acid exposure and 1) congenital and hereditary disorders (d = 9.069), and 2) foetal exposure during pregnancy (d = 6.632) compared to other studied AEDs. Pregnancy-related ADRs with levetiracetam and topiramate did not reach statistical significance, however neurological ADRs in children who were exposed to lamotrigine and levetiracetam continue to be the subject of scrutiny.There are ongoing concerns regarding exposure to all anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy. Poor seizure control in pregnancy is a cause of maternal death, valproic acid continues to be used by women despite it being a known teratogen, and other AEDs also carry risks of significant ADRs.AEDs have diverse modes of action, and the unique polypharmacology of AEDs influences their ADR profiles.Lamotrigine had a larger size effect than valproic acid (d =2.720 vs 1.846) for suspected pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal ADRs.There is a strong association between valproic acid exposure and congenital and hereditary disorders including foetal valproate spectrum disorder (FVSD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), spina bifida, polydactyly and cleft palate (d = 9.069).There is an association between valproic acid and foetal exposure during pregnancy (d = 6.632)."

We compared the phenotypic characteristics of Black Africans and White Europeans with recently diagnosed T2D to understand the ethnic differences in the manifestation of T2D.Methods We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, African Index Medicus, and Global Health for studies reporting information on phenotypic characteristics in Black Africans and White Europeans with recently diagnosed T2D.Results A total of 26 studies were included in this systematic review. Of these, 12 studies and 14 studies were conducted on 2,586 Black Africans in eight countries and 279,621 White Europeans in nine countries, respectively. Compared with White Europeans, Black Africans had a lower pooled mean age (49.4±4.4 years vs. 61.3±2.7 years), body mass index (26.1±2.6 kg/m2 vs. 31.4±1.1 kg/m2), and a higher pooled median glycated haemoglobin (9.0 [8.0-10.3]% vs. 7.1 [6.7-7.7]%). Ugandan and Tanzanian participants had lower markers of beta-cell function and insulin resistance when compared with four White European populations.Conclusion These findings provide evidence of the ethnic differences in the manifestation of T2D, underscoring the importance of understanding the underlying genetic and environmental factors influencing these phenotypic differences and formulating ethnic-specific approaches for managing and preventing T2D.HIGHLIGHTSEmerging evidence suggests differences in the presentation of type 2 diabetes in Black Africans and White Europeans.In this systematic review, we reported that compared with White Europeans, Black Africans presented with a lower mean age and body mass index, less co-existing hypertension, and more hyperglycaemia at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.Compared with some White European populations, Ugandan and Tanzanian participants presented with features of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and less insulin resistance."

Understanding adverse physical health outcomes including heart failure (HF) in persons exposed to sexual and physical abuse is of particular importance to help improve multidisciplinary approaches to mental and physical wellbeing, including cardiovascular management, among vulnerable populations.Methods This case-control study was performed at a tertiary hospital in metropolitan South Australia. At index HF admission 12 consecutive female patients with exposure to sexual and physical abuse or assault were identified from the trauma module of a structured psychiatric interview. Index admission data were classified into HF phenotype and aetiology using the criteria and definitions of the European Society of Cardiology. The presentation profile at index HF admission was compared to 12 gender and age-matched comparators.Results The clinical characteristics at index admission showed that most patients presented with pulmonary rales, peripheral oedema, and pulmonary congestion (67-75%), with diuretics the most common intervention (75%). By comparison to the non-exposed group, we observed differences between groups in HF severity determined by New York Heart Association class, diastolic blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) but not systolic BP, saturation of peripheral oxygen (Sp02) or HF phenotypes. There were no differences in troponin, creatinine, sodium, admission use of inotropes, vasodilators or diuretics, post-traumatic stress disorder or comorbidities between the exposed patients and age-matched female controls.Conclusion Women with a history of experiencing sexual and physical abuse or assault presented with a unique HF admission profile characterised by lower BP and HR. The findings support previous work suggesting that persons experiencing sexual and physical abuse or assault have blunted cardiovascular reactivity to stressors such as hospital admission."

However, the untargeted nature of these methods precludes conventional PCR approaches, and the metagenomic content of each sample increases the challenge of bioinformatic analysis. Here, we evaluate a previously described novel workflow for unbiased RNA virus sequence identification in a series of contrived and real-world samples. The novel multiplex library preparation workflow was developed for the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinIONTM sequencer using reverse transcription, whole genome amplification, and ONT’s Ligation Sequencing Kit with Native Barcode Expansion. The workflow includes spiked MS2 Phage as an internal positive control and generates an 8-plex library with 6 samples, a negative control and a gfp transcript positive control. Targeted and untargeted data analysis was performed using the EPI2ME Labs framework and open access tools that are readily accessible to most clinical laboratories. Contrived samples composed of common respiratory pathogens (Influenza A, Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Human Coronavirus 229E) in viral transport media (VTM) and bloodborne pathogens (Zika Virus, Hepatitis A Virus, Yellow Fever Virus and Chikungunya Virus) in human plasma were used to establish the limits of detection for this assay. We also evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the assay using remnant clinical samples and found that it showed 100% specificity and 62.9% clinical sensitivity. More studies are needed to further evaluate pathogen detection and better position thresholds for detection and non-detection in various clinical sample metagenomic mixtures."

They result in coercive and sometimes traumatic experiences for service users and carers. Legal and service reforms in various countries are intended to reduce rates of detention and improve service user experience. We aimed to inform policy and service delivery by providing an up-to-date synthesis of qualitative evidence on service users’ and carers’ experiences of assessment and detention under mental health legislation, updating previous reviews in which we searched for literature published up to 2018.Methods We searched five bibliographic databases for studies published between January 2018 and March 2023. We identified 24 additional studies reporting qualitative investigations of service users’ or carers’ experiences of assessment or detention under mental health legislation. A team including researchers with relevant personal experience analysed and synthesised data using a thematic synthesis approach.Results Findings suggest that views on compulsory admissions and assessment varied: many reports highlighted its often negative, traumatic impacts on emotional well-being and self-worth, with fewer accounts of it as an opportunity to access help and support, accompanied by feelings of relief. Experiences of racial discrimination, inequality of access, and dissatisfaction with support before and after hospital stay were more prominent than in our previous reviews.Conclusions Increasing service user and carer involvement in treatment decisions, provision of timely information at key stages of the admission process, training of key personnel, addressing the issue of discrimination, and investing in community alternatives of inpatient care may contribute to and lead to better overall treatment experiences."

Their development depends on multiscale morphogenetic processes and, while highly conserved across vertebrate evolution, their role in the pathophysiology of the mature heart is not fully understood. We report variant associations across the allele frequency spectrum for trabecular morphology in 47,803 participants of the UK Biobank using fractal dimension analysis of cardiac imaging. We identified an association between trabeculation and rare variants in 56 genes that regulate myocardial contractility and ventricular development. Genome-wide association studies identified 68 novel loci in pathways that regulate sarcomeric function, differentiation of the conduction system, and cell fate determination. We found that trabeculation-associated variants were modifiers of cardiomyopathy phenotypes with opposing effects in hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. Together, these data provide insights into mechanisms that regulate trabecular development and plasticity, and identify a potential role in modifying monogenic disease expression."

While its narrow definition as a hedonic or consummatory deficit evolved to encompass anticipatory and motivational reward facets, it remains unclear where reward deficits manifest. Since evidence that metabolic hormones influence reward processing accumulates, investigating their role in alleviating reward deficits may provide crucial insights. To address these gaps, we conducted a study with 103 participants, including 52 patients with MDD and 51 healthy control participants (HCPs). After overnight fasting, blood samples were collected to determine the concentration of ghrelin, glucose, insulin, and triglycerides in serum/plasma. Participants then completed a taste test with repeated ratings of wanting and liking for snacks before and after tasting, allowing to gradually move from reward anticipation to consummation. Patients with MDD showed decreased wanting (p = .046) but not liking for food rewards during visual anticipation. However, these group differences disappeared once patients inspected and tasted the food as patients increased wanting relative to HCPs (p = .004), providing strong evidence against the hypothesis of a consummatory deficit (Bayes Factors > 9). In contrast to a narrow definition of anhedonia, higher scores on the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) were more strongly associated with reduced anticipatory food wanting (p = .010), not liking, and more pronounced increases in wanting with reward proximity (p = .037). Across groups and phases, acyl ghrelin was associated with higher wanting and liking ratings, while poor glycemic control was associated with anhedonia. Overall, our study demonstrates that MDD and its cardinal symptom, anhedonia, are associated with a reduced anticipation of rewards rather than an impaired ability to experience pleasure. Since ghrelin was associated with elevated reward ratings, targeting the gut-brain axis could be a promising avenue for treating reward deficits.Download figureOpen in new tab"

Many low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) have gaps in their existing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) surveillance systems that negatively impact global efforts geared towards achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper explains the contribution of collaborative surveillance systems to health systems strengthening (HSS) learning from integrating NG surveillance into existing Ministries of Health’s (MoH) antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance services in Malawi and Zimbabwe.Methods We used the WHO Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (EGASP) implementation experiences in Malawi and Zimbabwe to demonstrate the collaboration in AMR and STI surveillance. We conducted qualitative interviews with purposively selected health managers directly participating in the AMR and STI programs using a standardized key informant guide to describe how to plan for a collaborative surveillance system. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted to delineate stakeholders’ recommendations using the health systems’ building blocks.Results Stakeholder engagement, prioritization of needs, and power to negotiate were key drivers to a successful collaborative surveillance system. Weak governance, policies, lack of accountability, and different priorities, coupled with weak collaborations, workforce, and health information systems, were challenges faced in having effective collaborative surveillance systems. Data availability, use, and negotiation power were key drivers for the prioritization of collaborative surveillance. Including collaborative surveillance in primary health services and increasing government budget allocation for surveillance were recommended.Conclusions Strengthening collaborative surveillance systems in LMICs using a people-centered approach increases transparency and accountability and empowers national institutions, communities, and stakeholders to engage in sustainable activities that potentially strengthen health systems. EGASP implementations in Zimbabwe and Malawi serve as models for other countries planning to implement or improve collaborative surveillance systems in their context."

This study aims to describe a series of cases harboring a rare LoF variant in the PMS2CL pseudogene that has been incorrectly assigned to PMS2 with different nomenclatures. We reviewed data from 647 Brazilian patients who underwent multigene genetic testing at a single center to identify those harboring the PMS2 V1:c.2186_2187delTC or V2:c.2182_2184delACTinsG variants, allegedly located at PMS2 exon 13. Gene-specific PCR and transcript sequencing was performed. Among the 647 individuals, 1.8% (12) carried the investigated variants, with variant allele frequencies ranging from 15 to 34%. By visually inspecting the alignments, we confirmed that both V1 and V2 represented the same variant and through gene-specific PCR and PMS2 transcript analysis, we demonstrated that V1/V2 is actually located in the PMS2CL pseudogene. Genomic databases (ExAC and gnomAD) report an incidence of 2.5% - 5.3% of this variant in the African population. Currently, V1 is classified as “uncertain significance” and V2 as “conflicting” in ClinVar, with several laboratories classifying them as “pathogenic”. We identified a frequent African PMS2CL LoF variant in the Brazilian population that is misclassified as a PMS2 variant. It is likely that V1/V2 have been erroneously assigned to PMS2 in several manuscripts and by clinical laboratories, underscoring a disparity-induced matter. Considering the limitations of short-read NGS differentiating between certain regions of PMS2 and PMS2CL, using complementary methodologies is imperative to provide an accurate diagnosis."

A total of 839,344 adults aged 18 and above with continuous enrollment in the health plan were included in the analyses. Participants were grouped into four categories based on their COVID-19 diagnosis and whether they had at least one of the three common metabolic disorders at baseline (diabetes, obesity, or hypertension).Measures and methods ICD-10-CM codes were used to determine new symptoms and conditions after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as ending 21 days after initial diagnosis date, or index period for those who did not have a COVID-19 diagnosis. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to create comparable reference groups. Cox proportional hazard models were conducted to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals.Results Among the 772,377 individuals included in the analyses, 36,742 (4.8%) without and 20,912 (2.7%) with a baseline metabolic disorder were diagnosed with COVID-19. On average, COVID-19 patients with baseline metabolic disorders had more 2.4 more baseline comorbidities compared to those without baseline metabolic disorders. Compared to adults with no baseline metabolic condition, the risks of developing new clinical sequelae were highest among COVID-19 patients with a baseline metabolic condition (HRs ranging from 1.51 to 3.33), followed by those who had a baseline metabolic condition but with no COVID-19 infection (HRs ranging from 1.33 to 2.35), and those who had COVID-19 but no baseline metabolic condition (HRs ranging from 1.34 to 2.85).Conclusions In a large national cohort of commercially insured adults, COVID-19 patients with a baseline metabolic condition had the highest risk of developing new clinical sequelae post-acute infection phase, followed by those who had baseline metabolic condition but no COVID-19 infection and those who had COVID-19 but no baseline metabolic disorder."

Investigating this issue has been difficult due to the lack of representative longitudinal data on child mTBI that includes adequate measures of subsequent mental health symptoms and service use in young people.Methods We used data from the ABCD longitudinal cohort study to examine the association between mTBI and psychiatric diagnoses, symptoms, and psychiatric service use in over 11,000 children aged 9-10 at i) baseline, and ii) with new cases of mTBI since baseline and psychiatric outcomes and service use at two-year follow-up. We also compared mTBI cases to a comparison group of participants with orthopaedic injury but without mTBI. Mixed-effects models were used and adjusted for demographic and social covariates, with missing data imputed using random forest multiple imputation. To account for baseline mental health outcomes, we used propensity-score matching to identify a comparison sample matched on potential confounding variables and baseline outcome measures.Results When examined without adjustment for baseline mental health, both lifetime mTBI at baseline, and new occurrence of mTBI at two-year follow-up, were reliably associated with an increased risk of DSM-5 anxiety and behavioural disorders, mental health symptom scores measured psychometrically, and increased psychiatric service use. These associations were not present, or occasionally only minimally present, in the orthopaedic injury comparison group. However, controlling for baseline mental health using propensity-score matching resulted in no association between new incidence mTBI and psychiatric symptoms, diagnoses and service use, with the exception of parent-reported anxiety and conduct symptom scores in supplementary analyses.Conclusion The association between childhood mTBI and subsequent psychiatric problems and service use may be largely explained by pre-existing mental health problems."

Patterns of (in)equalities in referrals in a representative cohort of older adults in England,"AbstractImportance Social prescribing (SP) is a mechanism of care referring people to non-clinical forms of support and services in local communities to improve health and wellbeing. But there is much contention over whether SP is in fact provided disproportionately more to individuals who are less disadvantaged. However, a comprehensive analysis of who is receiving SP from both medical and non-medical referral routes has never been undertaken.Objective To incorporate bespoke novel questions on SP into a nationally-representative cohort study to assess whether SP is truly reaching individuals most in need.Design We used data from Wave 10 (2021/23) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) involving richly-phenotyped adults aged 50+ living in England. We explored how SP was patterned according to social and health inequalities, all measured in Wave 9 (2018/19; prior to the reported engagement in SP). Multiple ordinal regression models were used to explore predictors of receiving a SP referral.Setting Community-dwelling older adults living in EnglandParticipants 7,283 adults aged 50+ answered the self-completion questionnaire at wave 10 so were included in analyses.Main outcomes and measures Participants were asked if they had received a referral to a wide range of community-based activities by a doctor, social worker or other health professionalResults 495 adults (6.8%) reported receiving a SP referral, and 435 (88%) accepted. Age was a significant predictor of referrals (OR 1.02, CI 1.01-1.03), but being female was not (OR 1.05, CI 0.84-1.30). Receiving benefits increased referral odds two-fold (OR 2.03, CI 1.53-2.70) and being in the lowest wealth tertile (relative to middle tertile) by 55% (CI 1.13-2.13). Education and employment status did not predict referrals. Referrals were most common for individuals with depression (OR=1.60, CI 1.20-2.12), diabetes (OR=1.52, CI 1.11-2.10), chronic pain (OR=1.57, CI 1.22-2.02), multiple long-term conditions (4+ conditions, OR=2.8, CI 1.41-5.51), and who were physically inactive (OR=1.63, CI 1.10-2.41).Conclusions and relevance There is some initial evidence of SP referrals occurring amongst older adults in England, with high uptake amongst those referred. Promisingly, those with highest socio-economic need and most long-term health conditions particularly appear to be receiving support.Question Who is receiving referrals to social prescribing programmes?Findings In this analysis of a nationally representative cohort study of 7,283 richly-phenotyped adults aged 50+ living in England, SP was offered most to individuals experiencing socio-economic adversity with health needs including depression, diabetes, chronic pain, multiple long-term conditions, and those who were physically inactive.Meaning Promisingly, older adults with highest socio-economic need and most long-term health conditions particularly appear to be receiving support through social prescribing."

We aim to compare the effects of two common glucose lowering medications; sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2I) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4I), on the incidence of diabetic retinopathy and cataracts in T2DM patients in Hong Kong.Methods Retrospective population-based cohort study of T2DM patients treated with SGLT2I or DPP4I between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2020. Propensity score matching (1:1 ratio) between SGLT2I and DPP4I users was performed on demographics, past co-morbidities, number of prior hospitalizations, duration from T2DM diagnosis to intial drug exposure, non-SGLT2I/DPP4I medications (including other anti-diabetes drugs), abbreviated modification of diet in renal disease, HbA1c, fasting glucose, and their time-weighted means. Sensitivity analysis using a one-year lag time and competing risk analyses using cause-specific and sub-distribution hazard models were conducted.Results This study cohort included 26 165 SGLT2I and 42 796 DPP4I users (total: N=68 961 patients; 56.43% males, median age: 62.0 years old (standard deviation (SD): 12.8)). Over a median follow-up of 5.56 years (IQR: 5.24-5.80) and after propensity score matching (SGLT2I: N=26 165; DPP4I: N=26 165), SGLT2I users had lower incidences of cataract (4.54% vs. 6.64%%, standardised mean difference [SMD]=0.09) and diabetic retinopathy (3.65 vs. 6.19, SMD=0.12) compared to DPP4I users. SGLT2I use was associated with lower risks of new onset cataract (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: [0.62– 0.72] P<0.0001) and diabetic retinopathy (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.53–0.62], P<0.0001). These associations remained significant on multivariable Cox regression ;cataract: HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.64–0.75 (P<0.0001); diabetic retinopathy: HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.63–0.75 (P<0.0001).Conclusions Amongst T2DM patients in Hong Kong, SGLT2I use was associated with lower risks of new onset cataract or diabetic retinopathy compared to DPP4I use.Synopsis/Precis Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2I) use was associated with lower rates of new onset diabetic retinopathy and cataracts compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4I) use in patients with type 2 diabetes melllitus (T2DM) from Hong Kong.What is already known on this topic Various glucose lowering medications may have additional beneficial or aggravating properties for/against diabetic retinopathy and cataract formation in diabetic populations beyond their glucose lowering capabilities.What this study adds This study showed that SGLT2I use was associated with significantly lower rates of new onset cataracts and diabetic retinopathy when compared to DPP4I use in a T2DM population in Hong Kong. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based study on the effects of SGLT2I and DPP4I use on the development of cataracts in individuals with T2DM.How this study might affect research, practice or policy This study provides preliminary data for further evaluation of SGLT2I and DPP4I use in preventing the incidence and progression of cataracts and diabetic retinopathy in a T2DM individuals. This study may also aid clinicians in deciding between SGLT2 and DPP4I if microvascular retinal complications and cataracts are a concern in individual cases."

At present, due to cost and technical limitations, profiling cell types is not practical in large epidemiology cohorts (n>1000). Here, we used computational deconvolution to identify cell types in COPD and IPF lungs whose abundances and cell type-specific gene expression are associated with disease diagnosis and severity.Methods We analyzed lung tissue RNA-seq data from 1026 subjects (COPD, n=465; IPF, n=213; control, n=348) from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium. We performed RNA-seq deconvolution, querying thirty-eight discrete cell-type varieties in the lungs. We tested whether deconvoluted cell-type abundance and cell type-specific gene expression were associated with disease severity.Results The abundance score of twenty cell types significantly differed between IPF and control lungs. In IPF subjects, eleven and nine cell types were significantly associated with forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), respectively. Aberrant basaloid cells, a rare cells found in fibrotic lungs, were associated with worse FVC and DLCO in IPF subjects, indicating that this aberrant epithelial population increased with disease severity. Alveolar type 1 and vascular endothelial (VE) capillary A were decreased in COPD lungs compared to controls. An increase in macrophages and classical monocytes was associated with lower DLCO in IPF and COPD subjects. In both diseases, lower non-classical monocytes and VE capillary A cells were associated with increased disease severity. Alveolar type 2 cells and alveolar macrophages had the highest number of genes with cell type-specific differential expression by disease severity in COPD and IPF. In IPF, genes implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF, such as matrix metallopeptidase 7, growth differentiation factor 15, and eph receptor B2, were associated with disease severity in a cell type-specific manner.Conclusion Utilization of RNA-seq deconvolution enabled us to pinpoint cell types present in the lungs that are associated with the severity of COPD and IPF. This knowledge offers valuable insight into the alterations within tissues in more advanced illness, ultimately providing a better understanding of the underlying pathological processes that drive disease progression."

The intervention was weekly oral doses of 10,000 IU vitamin D3 (n=228) or placebo (n=222) for 3 years. Outcome measures were serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25[OH]D3) concentrations, grip strength, standing long jump distance, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak, determined using 20-metre multi-stage shuttle run tests) and the proportion of children with EIB, all measured at end-study.Results 64.7% of participants had serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations <75 nmol/L at baseline. At 3-year follow-up, children randomised to vitamin D vs. placebo had higher mean serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations (97.6 vs. 58.8 nmol/L respectively; adjusted mean difference [aMD] 39.9 nmol/L, 95% CI 36.1 to 43.6) and long jump distance (128.3 vs. 122.1 cm; aMD 3.6 cm, 95% CI 0.0 to 7.2). No end-study differences in grip strength, VO2peak, or spirometric lung volumes were seen, but administration of vitamin D vs. placebo was associated with a borderline-significant increased risk of EIB (14.5% vs. 8.6%; adjusted odds ratio 1.92, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.73).Conclusion A 3-year course of weekly oral supplementation with 10,000 IU vitamin D3 elevated serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations in South African schoolchildren and induced a small increase in long jump distance, but had no effect on grip strength or VO2 peak. Potential effects of vitamin D on risk of EIB require further research.What is already known on this topic?Observational studies have reported that vitamin D deficiency associates with reduced muscle strength and peak oxygen uptake and increased risk of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in children. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) of vitamin D supplementation to improve children’s muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness have yielded conflicting results.What this study adds This RCT, conducted in South African schoolchildren aged 8-11 years at baseline, found that a 3-year course of weekly oral supplementation with 10,000 IU vitamin D3 improved vitamin D status and resulted in a small (3.6 cm), borderline-significant increase in long jump distance, but had no effect on grip strength or peak oxygen uptake. Administration of vitamin D was associated with a borderline-significant increased risk of EIB.How this study might affect research, practice or policy Taken together with null results from another Phase 3 randomised controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation conducted in Mongolian children, our findings do not suggest that weekly oral vitamin D supplementation exerts clinically significant effects on muscle strength or peak oxygen uptake in schoolchildren in whom rickets has been excluded. Further research into potential effects of vitamin D supplementation on risk of EIB is needed."

Patterns and predictors of social prescribing referrals in 160,128 UK patients","AbstractBackground Social prescribing (SP) is growing rapidly across the world as a way to tackle social determinants of health. However, whom it is reaching and how effectively it is being implemented remains unclear.Methods This study undertook the first analyses of a large database of administrative data from over 160,000 individuals referred to SP across the UK. Data were analysed using descriptive analyses and regression modelling, including logistic regression for binary outcomes and negative binomial regression for count variables.Findings 72-85% of referrals for SP were from medical routes (primary or secondary health care). While these referrals demonstrate equality in reaching across socio-demographic groups, individuals from more deprived areas, younger adults, men, and ethnic minority groups were reached more equitably via non-medical referral routes. Despite 90% of referrals leading to contact with a link worker, only 38% resulted in any intervention being received. A shortage of provision of community activities - especially ones relevant to mental health, practical support, and social relationships - was evident. There was also substantial heterogeneity in how SP is being implemented across UK nations.Interpretation Non-medical referral routes could play an important role in addressing inequality in accessing social prescribing, therefore should be prioritised. Additionally, more financial and infrastructural resource and strategic planning are needed to address low intervention rates. Further investment into large-scale data platforms and staff training are needed to continue monitoring the development and distribution of social prescribing.Significance statement Social prescribing - linking patients with non-medical forms of support in local communities - has been proposed as a way to address social determinants of health and improve health and wellbeing outcomes, leading to increasing implementation of programmes globally. But reviews into the use of SP suggest that referrals are not equitable and could even be disproportionately reaching individuals who are less disadvantaged. Analysing data from the most widely adopted digital SP platform in the UK, we show that medical referral routes (e.g. via GPs) reach people across all demographic groups equally, even though some demographic groups have greater health needs. But non-medical referral routes (e.g. through social care or communities) are helping to address inequalities and provide more equitable access."

Application of NLP in the clinical domain is important due to the rich unstructured information implanted in clinical documents, which often remains inaccessible in structured data. Empowered by the recent advance of language models (LMs), there is a growing interest in their application within the clinical domain. When applying NLP methods to a certain domain, the role of benchmark datasets are crucial as benchmark datasets not only guide the selection of best-performing models but also enable assessing of the reliability of the generated outputs. Despite the recent availability of LMs capable of longer context, benchmark datasets targeting long clinical document classification tasks are absent. To address this issue, we propose LCD benchmark, a benchmark for the task of predicting 30-day out-of-hospital mortality using discharge notes of MIMIC-IV and statewide death data. Our notes have a median word count of 1687 and an interquartile range of 1308 to 2169. We evaluated this benchmark dataset using baseline models, from bag-of-words and CNN to Hierarchical Transformer and an open-source instruction-tuned large language model. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the model outputs, including manual review and visualization of model weights, to offer insights into their predictive capabilities and limitations. We expect LCD benchmarks to become a resource for the development of advanced supervised models, prompting methods, or the foundation models themselves, tailored for clinical text.The benchmark dataset is available at https://github.com/Machine-Learning-for-Medical-Language/long-clinical-doc"

However, the rapid rate of development in nanopore sequencing and library preparation methods complicates the process of selecting a standardized method for unbiased RNA virus detection. Here, we evaluate multiple sequencing approaches to identify a workflow with sufficient sensitivity, limits of detection, and throughput for potential utilization in a clinical laboratory setting. Four separate library preparation methods for the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer are compared, including direct RNA, direct cDNA, rapid cDNA, and double stranded cDNA. We also establish that depletion of host RNA is not required and can be deleterious for viral RNA detection in some instances when using samples in viral transport media (VTM) or plasma. Using unbiased whole genome amplification following reverse transcription, we achieve limits of detection on the order of 1.95E03 GE/mL of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) spiked in human plasma. We also report initial detection of 5.43E06 GE/mL of coronavirus 229E spiked into VTM samples containing human background RNA which are expected to decrease significantly during upcoming testing. These metrics were achieved within a 6-plex multiplex reaction, illustrating the potential to increase throughput and decrease costs for relevant sample analysis. Data analysis was performed using EPI2ME Labs framework and open access tools that are readily accessible to most clinical laboratories. Taken together, this work describes an optimized method for unbiased nanopore sequencing and analysis of RNA viruses present in two common clinical matrices."

Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) functions as a part of complex opioid system and supports both homeostatic and hedonic control of eating behavior. Thirteen patients with AN and thirteen healthy controls (HC) were included in this study. We measured 1) MOR availability with [11C]carfentanil positron emission tomography (PET), 2) brain glucose uptake (BGU) with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) PET during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and 3) blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal with functional magnetic resonance imaging. All subjects underwent a screening visit consisting of physical examination, anthropometric measurements, fasting blood samples, an oral glucose tolerance test, psychiatric assessment, and an inquiry regarding medical history. Body fat mass (%) was measured and M value was calculated. MOR availability from caudate and putamen was higher in patients with AN and those from nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and thalamus showed the higher trend in patients with AN. There was no area where MOR availability was lower in patients with AN. BGU was not different between AN and HC. MOR availability and BGU were negatively correlated in caudate, NAcc and thalamus and showed the trend of negative association in putamen. In conclusion, AN is associated with higher MOR availability in the brain regions implicated in reward processing, while BGU remains unaltered. Therefore, the endogenous opioid system might be one of the key components underlying AN. This better understanding of AN could support the development of new treatments for AN."

Brain vital sign scans were acquired from 9 MMA athletes and 15 age- and sex-matched controls. Our analysis specifically compared differences in brain vital signs between MMA athletes and controls at baseline. We predicted that MMA athletes would show significant differences relative to controls due to their ongoing exposure to repetitive head impacts. Participants were scanned to extract three well-established ERPs: N100 for auditory sensation; P300 for basic attention; and N400 for cognitive processing. Scans were verified using automated reports, with N100, P300, and N400 amplitudes and latencies manually identified by a blinded reviewer. Groups were evaluated at the waveform level with a mass-univariate analysis using non-parametric resampling. Brain vital signs were compared across groups with a Kruskal-Wallis H-test for independent samples, with FDR correction for multiple comparisons. We identified significant differences between MMA athletes and controls. Specifically, there were significant N400 amplitude reductions, indicating that exposure to repetitive head impacts in MMA may be associated with changes in brain function."

This study utilizes cardiac ultrasound radiomics (i.e., ultrasomics) to risk stratify AMI patients when predicting all-cause mortality.Methods The study included 197 patients: a) retrospective internal cohort (n=155) of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (n=63) and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (n=92) patients, and b) external cohort from the multicenter Door-To-Unload in ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction [DTU-STEMI] Pilot Trial (n=42). Echocardiography images of apical 2, 3, and 4-chamber were processed through an automated deep-learning pipeline to extract ultrasomic features. Unsupervised machine learning (topological data analysis) generated AMI clusters followed by a supervised classifier to generate individual predicted probabilities. Validation included assessing the incremental value of predicted probabilities over the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score 2.0 to predict 1-year all-cause mortality in the internal cohort and infarct size in the external cohort.Results Three phenogroups were identified: Cluster A (high-risk), Cluster B (intermediate-risk), and Cluster C (low-risk). Cluster A patients had decreased LV ejection fraction (P=0.004) and global longitudinal strain (P=0.027) and increased mortality at 1-year (log rank P=0.049). Ultrasomics features alone (C-Index: 0.74 vs. 0.70, P=0.039) and combined with global longitudinal strain (C-Index: 0.81 vs. 0.70, P<0.001) increased prediction of mortality beyond the GRACE 2.0 score. In the DTU-STEMI clinical trial, Cluster A was associated with larger infarcts size (>10% LV mass, P=0.003), compared to remaining clusters.Conclusions Ultrasomics-based phenogroup clustering, augmented by TDA and supervised machine learning, provides a novel approach for AMI risk stratification."

Therefore, we will perform scoping reviews of the literature to inform available semi-quantitative and quantitative MRI scoring systems and protocols for the assessment and monitoring of skeletal muscle involvement in patients with IIMs with the final goal of providing evidence-based information for the future development of a universal standardized MRI scoring system in specific research and clinical settings in this population.Methods Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane) will be searched to select relevant articles published from January 2000 to October 2023. Data will be synthesized narratively.Discussion This scoping review will extensively map evidence on the indications, utility for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity and damage using skeletal muscle MRI in IIMs. The results will allow the development of consensus recommendations for clinical practice and enable the standardization of research methods for MRI assessment of skeletal muscle changes in patients with IIMs."

In this study, YouTube was mined to collect audio data from individuals with self-declared positive COVID-19 tests as well as those with other upper respiratory infections (URI) and healthy subjects discussing a diverse range of topics. The resulting dataset was transcribed with the Whisper model and used to assess the capacity of LLMs for detecting self-reported COVID-19 cases and performing variant classification. Following prompt optimization, LLMs achieved accuracies of 0.89, 0.97, respectively, in the tasks of identifying self-reported COVID-19 cases and other respiratory illnesses. The model also obtained a mean accuracy of 0.77 at identifying the variant of self-reported COVID-19 cases using only symptoms and other health-related factors described in the YouTube videos. In comparison with past studies, which used scripted, standardized voice samples to capture biomarkers, this study focused on extracting meaningful information from public online audio data.

We evaluated performance under laboratory conditions of the new Q Filariasis Antigen Test (QFAT) against the Filariasis Test Strip (FTS) for detecting antigen of Wuchereria bancrofti, a causative agent of lymphatic filariasis (LF).Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared test performance using available panels of serum (n=195) and plasma (n=189) from LF endemic areas in the Asia-Pacific region (Samoa, American Samoa and Myanmar) together with Australian negative controls (n=46). Prior antigen and antibody positivity status of endemic samples had been determined by rapid test or ELISA. The proportion of all samples testing positive at 10 minutes was higher with QFAT (44.8%) than FTS (41.3%).Concordance between tests was 93.5% (kappa 0.87, N=417) at 10 minutes, and increased over time to 98.8% (kappa 0.98) at 24 hours. Sensitivity of QFAT and FTS at 10 minutes compared to prior antigen results were 92% (95% CI 88.0-96.0) and 86% (95% CI 80.0-90.0), respectively. Specificity was 98% for QFAT and 99% for FTS at 10 minutes. Sensitivity increased over time for both tests, rising to 99% for QFAT and 97% for FTS at 24 hours. QFAT positively identified all microfilaria (Mf)-positive samples, whereas FTS was negative for 3 of 66 Mf-positives. For both QFAT and FTS, there was evidence of cross-reaction with Dirofilaria repens and Onchocerca lupi but not with Acanthochilonema reconditum, Cercopithifilaria bainae or Strongyloides. Disadvantages noted for QFAT were inconvenient packaging and an additional buffer step. Advantages of QFAT include ease-of-use, smaller sample (10-20 µL vs 75 µL for FTS), clearer control line, and higher sensitivity for Mf-positive samples.Conclusions/Significance. Under lab conditions, QFAT is a suitable rapid Ag test for use in filariasis elimination programmes and has advantages over FTS.Author summary Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating and stigmatizing disease that affects populations in tropical areas usually in developing social environments. It is caused by a parasite worm transmitted by mosquitoes. The WHO programme to eliminate LF aims to improve the lives of their residents through a global mass drug administration campaign, and provide the tools to monitor prevalence within the countries’ public health contexts. It is imperative to utilize the most effective and practical diagnostic tests to monitor progress to elimination of this disease, while ensuring a cost-effective and rapid implementation under potentially vulnerable settings. In this study we investigated the performance of a new rapid antigen diagnostic test for LF compared to the existing recommended test, in samples of known infection status from the Asia-Pacific region. The results showed the new test to be a suitable rapid antigen test, with advantages over the current test, for use in filariasis elimination programmes in the region."

Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is an antimicrobial agent and alternative treatment option that can be used to arrest dental decay. While there is optimism with SDF with regard to caries management, there is no true consensus on the number and frequency of applications for children. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of 38% SDF to arrest ECC at three different application regimen intervals.Methods Children with ECC were recruited from community dental clinics into an open-label, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized to one of three groups: visits one month, four months, or six months apart. Participants received applications of 38% SDF, along with 5% sodium fluoride varnish (NaFV), at the first two visits to treat cavitated carious lesions. Lesions were followed and arrest rates were calculated. Lesions were considered arrested if they were hard on probing and black in colour. Statistics included descriptive and bivariate analyses. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.Results Eighty-four children participated in the study (49 males and 35 females, mean age: 44.4 ± 14.2 months). Treatment groups were well matched with 28 participants per group. A total of 374 teeth and 505 lesions were followed. Posterior lesions represented only 29.1% of affected surfaces. Almost all SDF treated lesions were arrested for the one-month (98%) and four-month (95.8%) interval groups at the final visit. The six-month group experienced the lowest arrest rates; only 72% of lesions were arrested (p < 0.001). The duration of application intervals was inversely associated with improvements in arrest rates for all lesions.Conclusions Two applications of 38% SDF and 5% NaFV in one-month and four-month intervals were comparable and very effective in arresting ECC. Applications six months apart were less effective and could be considered inferior treatment.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04054635 (first registered 13/08/2019)."

Patients were considered exposed to antipsychotics if prescribed at least one antipsychotic in primary care between 2000-2019. We compared characteristics of patients prescribed and not prescribed antipsychotics; calculated annual prevalence rates for antipsychotic prescribing; and computed average daily antipsychotic doses stratified by patient characteristics.Results Of 309,378 patients first diagnosed with an SMI in primary care between 2000-2017, 212,618 (68.7%) were prescribed an antipsychotic between 2000-2019. Antipsychotic prescribing prevalence was 426 (95% CI, 420-433) per 1,000 patients in the year 2000, reaching a peak of 550 (547-553) in 2016, decreasing to 470 (468-473) in 2019. The proportion prescribed antipsychotics was higher amongst patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (81.0%) than with bipolar disorder (64.6%) and other non-organic psychoses (65.7%). Olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole accounted for 78.8% of all prescriptions. Higher mean olanzapine equivalent total daily doses were prescribed to patients with the following characteristics: schizophrenia diagnosis, ethnic minority status, male sex, younger age, and greater deprivation.Conclusions Antipsychotic prescribing is dominated by olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole. Two thirds of patients with diagnosed SMI were prescribed antipsychotics in primary care, but this proportion varied according to SMI diagnosis. There were disparities in both receipt and dose of antipsychotics across subgroups - further efforts are needed to understand why certain groups are prescribed higher doses and whether they require dose optimisation to minimise side effects."

We collected data from the electronic medical record. The primary outcome was duration from intubation to first documentation of light sedation, defined as a Sedation Agitation Scale score (SAS) of 3-4.Results The study included 264 patients, with 95 (36%) intubated in the ED and 169 (64%) in the ICU. Regarding anesthetic agents used for intubation, ketamine was the most commonly used drug in the ED and was used more frequently than in the ICU (61% vs 40%, p=0.001). Propofol was the predominant sedative used in the ICU, with a higher prevalence compared to the ED (50% vs 33%, p=0.01). Additionally, benzodiazepines and fentanyl were more frequently used in the ICU (39% vs 6%, p<0.001 and 68% vs 9.5%, p<0.001, respectively). Within 24 hours after intubation, 68% (65/95) ED patients and 82% (138/169) patients intubated in ICU achieved light sedation, with median durations of 13.5 hours and 10.5 hours. Patient location in the ED at intubation was associated with decreased probability of achieving light sedation at 24 hours (adjusted odds ratio 0.64, p=0.04).Conclusion Critically ill patients intubated in the ED are at risk of deeper sedation and a longer time to achieve light sedation compared to patients intubated in the ICU."

We report a rare variant in the cardiac troponin T gene, TNNT2; NM_001001430.3: c.571-1G>A (rs483352835) identified via research-based whole exome sequencing in two unrelated probands of Oceanian ancestry with cardiac phenotypes.The variant disrupts the canonical splice acceptor site, activating a cryptic acceptor and resulting in an in-frame deletion (p.Gln191del). The variant is rare in gnomAD v4.0.0 (13/780,762; 0.002%), with the highest frequency in South Asians (5/74,486; 0.007%) and has 16 ClinVar assertions (13 diagnostic clinical laboratories classify as variant of uncertain significance). There are at least 28 reported cases, many with Oceanian ancestry and diverse cardiac phenotypes. Indeed, among Oceanian-ancestry-matched datasets, the allele frequency ranges from 2.9-8.8% and is present in 2/4 (50%) Indigenous Australian alleles in Genome Asia 100K, with one participant being homozygous. With Oceanians deriving greater than 3% of their DNA from archaic genomes, we found c.571-1G>A in Vindija and Altai Neanderthal, but not the Altai Denisovan, suggesting an origin post Neanderthal divergence from modern humans 130-145 thousand years ago. Based on these data, we classify this variant as benign, and conclude it is not a monogenic cause of disease. Even with ongoing efforts to increase representation in genomics, we highlight the need for caution in assuming rarity of genetic variants in largely European datasets. Efforts to enhance diversity in genomic databases remain crucial."

Currently, there is no cure for the disease which is in part due to the heterogeneity in patient symptoms, trajectories and manifestations. There is a known genetic component of PD and genomic datasets have helped to uncover some aspects of the disease. Understanding the longitudinal variability of PD is essential as it has been theorised that there are different triggers and underlying disease mechanisms at different points during disease progression. In this paper, we perform longitudinal and cross-sectional experiments to identify which data modalities or combinations of modalities are informative at different time points. We use clinical, genomic, and proteomic data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. We validate the importance of flexible data integration by highlighting the varying combinations of data modalities for optimal stratification at different disease stages in idiopathic PD. We show there is a shared signal in the DNAm signatures of participants with a mutation in a causal gene of PD and participants with idiopathic PD. We also show that integration of SNPs and DNAm data modalities has potential for use as an early diagnostic tool for individuals with a genetic cause of PD."

It is hypothesized that the microbiome in obese subjects is more efficient than that in lean subjects in absorbing energy from food, thus predisposing to weight gain. A transformation in gut microbiota has been demonstrated in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery which has been positively associated with post-surgical weight loss. However, there is lack of studies investigating the impact of probiotics on weight loss in post-bariatric surgery patients. The objectives of our study were to investigate the impact of a probiotic, Lactobacillus GG (LGG), on weight loss and quality of life in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery.Methods The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01870544. Subjects were randomized to receive either LGG or placebo capsules. Percent total weight loss at their post-operative visits was calculated and differences between the two groups were tested using a t-test with unequal variances. The effect of LGG on Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) scores was estimated using a mixed model repeated measures model.Results The mean rate of change in percent total weight loss at the ‘30-day’ post-operative visit for the placebo and treatment groups was 0.098 and 0.079 (p = 0.41), respectively, whereas that at the ‘90-day’ post-operative visit was 0.148 and 0.126 (p = 0.18), respectively. The difference in GIQLI scores on ‘30-day’ and ‘90-day’ visits were 0.5 (−7.1, 8.0), p=0.91 and 3.7 (−4.9, 12.3), p=0.42, respectively. LGG was recovered from the stools of 3 out of 5 subjects in the treatment group.Conclusion We did not appreciate a significant difference in the mean rate of weight loss or GIQLI scores between the groups who received LGG versus placebo. This study demonstrated survival of lactobacillus during transit through the gastrointestinal tract."

While genome-wide association studies reporting on HF abound, its genetic etiology is not well understood due to its inherent polygenic nature. Moreover, these genetic insights have not been completely translated into effective strategies for the primary treatment of HF. In this study, we conducted a large-scale integrated multi-trait analysis using European-ancestry GWAS summary statistics of coronary artery disease and HF, involving near 2 million samples to identify novel risk loci associated with HF. 72 loci were newly identified with HF, of which 44 were validated in the replication phase. Transcriptome association analysis revealed 215 HF risk genes, including EDNRA and FURIN. Pathway enrichment analysis of risk genes revealed their enrichment in pathways closely related to HF, such as response to endogenous stimulus (adjusted P = 8.83×10-3), phosphate-containing compound metabolic process (adjusted P = 1.91×10-2). Single-cell analysis indicated significant enrichments of these genes in smooth muscle cells, fibroblast of cardiac tissue, and cardiac endothelial cells. Additionally, our analysis of HF risk genes identified 74 potential drugs for further pharmacological evaluation. These findings provide novel insights into the genetic determinants of HF, highlighting new genetic loci as potential interventional targets to HF treatment, with significant implications for public health and clinical practice."

Although data on harmful alcohol use have been collected by population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA), there is a dearth of analysis on the effect of HIV/ART status on harmful alcohol use in the SSA countries with PHIA surveys. This study uses data from the national representative PHIA to predict the harmful alcohol use prevalence.Methods A secondary analysis of the PHIA surveys: Namibia (n=27,382), Tanzania (n=1807), Zambia (n=2268), Zimbabwe (n=3418), Malawi (n=2098), Namibia (n=27,382), and Eswatini (n=2762). Using R version 4.2, the outcome variable and the descriptive variables were tested for association using chi square. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used identify significant variables associated with harmful alcohol use. We employed to test and apply machine learning (ML) methods through Super Learner, Decision Tree, Random Forest (RF), Lasso Regression, Sample mean and Gradient boosting. Evaluation metrics methods specifically confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) were used to evaluate the performance of predictive models. The cutoff point for statistically significant was P<0.05.Results Of the 12,460 persons, 15% used alcohol harmfully. Harmful alcohol use varied by countries and ranged from 8.7% in Malawi to 26.1% in Namibia (P<0.001). Females were less likely to use alcohol in a harmful way (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.29-0.35, P< 0.001). Compared to those HIV negative, persons that were with HIV-positive and on ART were less likely to use alcohol in a harmful way (AOR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.57-0.73, P<0.001) however persons that were HIV-positive and not on ART were more likely to use alcohol in a harmful way (OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.32-1.69, P<0.001). Being married or formally married was protective to harmful use of alcohol. The best performing models were Lasso or Super Learner or Random Forest were the best performing models while gradient boosting models or sample mean did not perform well.Conclusion The findings highlight concerning variations in harmful alcohol use prevalence across surveyed countries, with Namibia reporting the highest rate. Males, older individuals, those HIV positive and not yet on ART, and unmarried persons demonstrated a higher likelihood of engaging in harmful alcohol use. These findings collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the multiple factors influencing harmful alcohol use within the surveyed populations, the importance of targeted interventions at country and individual levels."

Here, we present an AI model that harnesses a broad array of data, including demographics, individual and family medical history, medication use, neuropsychological assessments, functional evaluations, and multimodal neuroimaging, to identify the etiologies contributing to dementia in individuals. The study, drawing on 51, 269 participants across 9 independent, geographically diverse datasets, facilitated the identification of 10 distinct dementia etiologies. It aligns diagnoses with similar management strategies, ensuring robust predictions even with incomplete data. Our model achieved a micro-averaged area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 in classifying individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Also, the micro-averaged AUROC was 0.96 in differentiating the dementia etiologies. Our model demonstrated proficiency in addressing mixed dementia cases, with a mean AUROC of 0.78 for two cooccurring pathologies. In a randomly selected subset of 100 cases, the AUROC of neurologist assessments augmented by our AI model exceeded neurologist-only evaluations by 26.25%. Furthermore, our model predictions aligned with biomarker evidence and its associations with different proteinopathies were substantiated through postmortem findings. Our framework has the potential to be integrated as a screening tool for dementia in various clinical settings and drug trials, with promising implications for person-level management."

We consider this problem in the context of search game modelling, and suggest that both demographic and behaviour data are used to configure certain model parameters. We show this integration in practice by using a combined dataset of over 150,000 individuals to configure a specific search game model that captures the environment, population, interventions and individual behaviours relating to winter health service pressures. The presence of this data enables us to more accurately explore the potential impact of service pressure interventions, which we do across 33,000 simulations using a computational version of the model. We find government advice to be the best-performing intervention in simulation, in respect of improved health, reduced health inequalities, and thus reduced pressure on health service utilisation."

We aimed to investigate changes in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke and CVST in South Korea before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the factors associated with these changes.Materials and Methods We conducted a nationwide time-series study using population-based databases between 2007 and 2022. The real-world and forecasted incidences of acute non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and CVST during the pandemic period (2020–2022) were estimated and compared with the pre-pandemic period (2007–2019). The prevalence of conventional risk factors was measured using time-series data. Finally, a time-series correlation analysis was performed to examine the temporal association between conventional risk factors, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.Results The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (SAH and ICH) was lower during the pandemic than during the pre-pandemic period. This observed decrease was associated with a reduction in the prevalence of conventional risk factors but not with SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. The incidence of CVST was higher during the pandemic than during the pre-pandemic period, which may be temporally related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = 0.349, P = 0.031).Conclusion We report reassuring evidence of hemorrhagic stroke associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. However, awareness of CVST may be required for future vaccine rollouts and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks."

In this study, we used cfDNA from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients to study various correlation factors that could improve the disease early-stage diagnostics and/or prognosis. We found that OSCC patient cfDNA concentration can serve as an indicator of tumor stage, malignancy, and survival prognosis. Deep genome sequencing of cfDNA revealed genomic alterations, such as copy number variations, fusion gene identification, and viral integrations. Copy number variation analysis suggested correlation with amplification and deletion in chromosome 1 at loci 1q, 2q, 3p, 3q and 8q22. Moreover, at these loci, amplification of TP53, PIK3CA and other genes related to keratinization in OSCC patients were observed. In addition, we identified the novel fusion gene, TRMO-TRNT1 ‘chimera’, in seven high-grade tumor samples. The parental genes of this chimera, TRMO and TRNT1, are known to play roles in tRNA modification and DNA repair, respectively. Therefore, our study indicates that liquid biopsy may thus serve as a sensitive tool to study OSCC patient genomic alterations by exploring cfDNA circulating in the plasma, by means of an easy-to-use blood test. Finally, we detected integrations of human papilloma virus, simian virus, and enterovirus in the OSCC samples, that may point to the origins of OSCC."

However, significant outbreaks have occurred in recent years. Data on infection rates and seroprevalence is often sparse, requiring robust mathematical models to estimate the burden of yellow fever. In particular, modelling is required to estimate the risk of outbreaks and inform policy decisions regarding the targeting of vaccination.Methods We present a dynamic, stochastic model of YF transmission which uses environ-mental covariates to estimate the force of infection due to spillover from the sylvatic (non-human primate) reservoir and the basic reproduction number for human-to-human transmission. We examine the potential for targets identified by the World Health Organization EYE Strategy (50%, 60% or 80% vaccination coverage in 1-60 year olds) to achieve different threshold values for the effective reproduction number. Threshold values are chosen to reflect the potential for seasonal and/or climatic variation in YF transmission even in a scenario where vaccination lowers the median reproduction number below 1.Results Based on parameter estimates derived from epidemiological data, it is found that the 2022 EYE Strategy target coverage is sufficient to reduce the static averaged annual effective reproduction number R below 1 across most or all regions in Africa depending on the effectiveness of reported vaccinations, but insufficient to reduce it below 0.5 and thereby eliminate outbreaks in areas with high seasonal range. Coverage levels aligned with the 2026 targets are found to significantly decrease the proportion of regions where R is greater than 0.5."

Yet the same effort has not been put forward to investigate additive moderate phenotypic effects of genetic variants in genes driving ALS risk, despite case-level evidence suggesting a potential oligogenic risk model. Considering its direct clinical and therapeutic implications, a large-scale robust investigation of oligogenicity in ALS is greatly needed.Here, we leveraged the Project MinE ALS Sequencing Consortium genome sequencing datasets of individuals with ALS (n = 6711) and controls (n = 2391) to identify signals of association between oligogenicity in known ALS genes (n=26) and disease risk, as well as clinical outcomes.Applying regression models to a discovery and replication cohort, we observed that the risk imparted from carrying rare variants in multiple known ALS genes was significant and was greater than the risk associated with carrying only a single rare variant, both in the presence and absence of variants in the most well-established ALS genes, such as C9orf72. However, in contrast to risk, the relationships between oligogenicity and ALS clinical outcomes, such as age of onset and survival, might not follow the same pattern as we did not observe any associations.Our findings represent the first large-scale, case-control assessment of oligogenic associations in ALS to date and confirm that oligogenic events involving known ALS risk genes are indeed relevant for the risk of disease in approximately 6% of ALS but not necessarily for disease onset and survival. This must be considered in genetic counselling and testing by ensuring the use of comprehensive gene panels even when a potential pathogenic variant has already been identified. Moreover, in the age of stratified medication and gene therapy, it supports the need of a complete genetic profile for the correct choice of therapy in all ALS patients."

We hypothesised that distinct endotypes of RAAS activation before noncardiac surgery are associated with increased risk of myocardial injury.Methods This was a pre-specified analysis of a multicentre randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN17251494) which randomised patients ≥60 years undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery to either continue, or stop, RAAS inhibitors (determined by pharmacokinetic profiles). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis identified distinct groups of patients with similar RAAS activation from samples obtained before induction of anesthesia, quantified by enzyme-linked immunoassays for plasma renin, aldosterone, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-3 (DPP3). The primary outcome, masked to investigators and participants, was myocardial injury (plasma high-sensitivity troponin-T).Results We identified three clusters, with similar proportions of RAAS inhibitors randomised to stop/continue. Cluster 1 (n=52; mean age (SD), 75±8 years; 54% female) and cluster 3 (n=25; 75±6 years; 44% female) had higher rates of myocardial injury (23/52 (44%) and 13/25 (52%), respectively), compared with 51/164 (31.1%) in cluster 2 (n=153; 70±6 years; 46% female; odds ratio:1.95, 95% CI:1.12-3.39, p=0.018). Cluster 2 was characterized by lower NT-proBNP (mean difference, 698pg.ml-1, 95% CI, 576-820) and higher renin (mean difference:350pg.ml-1, 95% CI:123-577), compared with clusters 1 and 3 with the higher rate of myocardial injury.Conclusion Effective preoperative RAAS inhibition is associated with lower risk of myocardial injury before non-cardiac surgery, independent of stopping/continuing RAAS inhibitors before surgery."

The diverse clinical presentation and poor knowledge of clinical factors that determine the course of disease are amongst the main challenges that hinder effective and personalised treatment for OLP patients.This study aimed to systematically identify clinical predictors of disease severity in OLP patients. A cohort of patients with histologically confirmed OLP (n=89) was recruited in a cross-sectional and single site study. A comprehensive assessment of clinical characteristics, medical and social history, haematological parameters, vitamin D levels, and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was carried out. Hierarchical linear regression identified the predictive value of clinical factors to OLP disease severity measured by the Oral Disease Severity Score (ODSS) and the Reticular/hyperkeratotic, Erosive/erythematous, Ulcerative (REU) scoring system.Findings revealed that extraoral lichen planus and insufficient vitamin D levels were significant predictors of both overall and gingival disease severity of OLP. Specifically, patients with lichen planus affecting the skin or other mucosal sites had a 5.766-unit higher OLP severity score (β=5.766, 95% CI=.744-10.788, p=.025) than those without extraoral involvement as measured by ODSS. Patients with insufficient vitamin D levels exhibited 5.490-unit increase in OLP severity (β=5.490, 95% CI=1.136-9.844, p=.014) compared to those with adequate vitamin D levels. The presence of dental plaque-induced gingivitis (β=4.833, 95% CI=.974-8.692, p=.015), was found to be a significant factor affecting gingival disease severity.This study revealed the importance of adequate vitamin D levels in OLP patients and suggests embedding vitamin D pre-treatment screening to optimise management of OLP. Future research should focus on elucidating the biological mechanisms underlying the protective effects of vitamin D in OLP."

Although various treatments have been developed, the limited efficacy calls for more and further exploration of its characteristics.Methods Datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were used for identifying the tumor purity of DLBCL. Survival analysis was employed for analyzing the prognosis of DLBCL patients. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to detect the important factor that influenced the prognosis. Drug sensitive prediction was performed to evaluate the value of the constructed model.Results VCAN, CD3G and C1QB were identified as three key genes that impacted the outcome of DLBCL patients both in GEO datasets and samples from our center. Among them, VCAN and CD3G+ T cells were correlated with favorable prognosis, and C1QB was correlated with worse prognosis. The ratio of CD68+ macrophages and CD8+ T cells was associated with better prognosis. In addition, CD3G+ T cells ratio was significantly correlated with CD68+ macrophages, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells ratio, indicating it could play an important role in the anti-tumor immunity in DLBCL. The riskScore model constructed based on the RNASeq data of VCAN, C1QB and CD3G work well in predicting the prognosis and drug sensitivity.Conclusion VCAN, CD3G and C1QB were three key genes that influenced the tumor purity of DLBCL, and could also exert certain impact on drug sensitivity and prognosis of DLBCL patients."

We conducted a longitudinal analysis of the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative cohort to investigate the involvement of DNA damage in PD. Our findings revealed that PD patients exhibit disrupted DNA repair pathways and biased suppression of longer transcripts, indicating the presence of age-related, transcription-stalling DNA damage. Notably, this DNA damage signature was only detected in patients with more severe motor symptom progression over a three-year period, suggesting its potential as a predictor of disease severity. We further validated this signature in independent PD cohorts and confirmed increased signs of DNA damage in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta through histopathological analysis of PD brains. Our study sheds light on an aging-related mechanism in PD pathogenesis and identifies markers of disease progression providing a readily applicable diagnostic platform to prognosticate disease progression.One Sentence Summary Parkinson’s disease patients display a DNA damage signature in blood that is predictive of disease progression."

Women with singleton non-anomalous pregnancies and no PTB history were prospectively enrolled, screened at 191/7-206/7 weeks gestation with a maternal circulating biomarker test for spontaneous PTB (sPTB) risk, and followed through neonatal hospital discharge. Those identified at higher risk (≥16.0%, approximately twice the U.S. population risk) were offered vaginal progesterone (200 mg) and aspirin (81 mg) daily, and care management comprising increased patient outreach and education. Outcomes were compared for prospective arm participants who screened either “not-higher-risk” or “higher-risk accepting treatment” (modified intent-to-treat population) with those in a ChristianaCare historical arm of 10000 pregnancies. Co-primary outcomes were: neonatal morbidity and mortality, as measured by a composite neonatal morbidity index (NMI) score integrating medical complications with neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) length of stay or death; and neonatal hospital length of stay (NNLOS). Cox proportional hazards survival analysis and ordinal logistic regression were used to evaluate outcomes and control for differences between arms.Results A COVID-prompted research shutdown occurred when 1460 biomarker-screened individuals had reached 37 weeks’ gestation in a racially diverse prospective arm. Of these, 34.7% (507/1460) had biomarker scores indicating higher risk, with 56.4% (286/507) accepting intervention and 43.6% (221/507) declining. The remaining 65.3% (953/1460) were designated not-higher-risk. Prospective arm neonates had lower NMI scores (odds ratio, 0.81, 95% CI, 0.67-0.98, P=0.031), and severe neonatal morbidity (NMI ≥3) was reduced by 18% compared to historical controls. Neonatal hospital stays also were shorter (hazard ratio, 1.35, 95% CI, 1.08-1.70, P=0.01), with average NNLOS decreasing by 21% in a quantile of longest stays.Conclusion Improved neonatal outcomes after biomarker PTB risk stratification and preventive care management for higher-risk individuals suggests a test-and-treatment strategy that can ameliorate PTB complications and associated medical, societal and economic burdens in a previously unidentifiable patient population: singleton, often nulliparous, pregnancies deemed clinically low risk.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT03151330 (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03151330)Funding Source Sera Prognostics, Inc."

We conducted a retrospective cohort study among persons who initiated treatment for rifampicin-resistant and multi/extensively drug-resistant (RR and M/XDR) TB reported to the country of Georgia’s TB surveillance during 2009-2017. Exposures included HIV serologic status, diabetes, and HCV status. Our outcome was all-cause post-TB mortality determined by cross-validating vital status with Georgia’s death registry through November 2019. We estimated adjusted hazard rate ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of post-TB mortality among participants with and without comorbidities using cause-specific hazard regressions. Among 1032 eligible participants, 34 (3.3%) died during treatment and 87 (8.7%) died post-TB treatment. Among those who died post-TB treatment, the median time to death was 21 months (interquartile range 7–39) post-TB treatment. After adjusting for confounders, the hazard rates of post-TB mortality were higher among participants with HIV co-infection (aHR=3.74, 95%CI 1.77–7.91) compared to those without HIV co-infection. In our cohort, post-TB mortality occurred most commonly in the first three years post-TB treatment. Linkage to care for common TB comorbidities post-treatment may reduce post-TB mortality rates."

We previously demonstrated that miR-125b is upregulated in ATH and is a main regulator of cholesterol metabolism in macrophages. Herein we hypothesized that inhibiting miR-125b may attenuate ATH.Methods and results In the ApoE-/- mice model fed with a high fat diet for 14 weeks, we inhibited miR-125b using an antagomiR over a 4-week period. We observed a significant reduction in plaque size, accompanied by diminished infiltration of F4/80 macrophages and attenuation of NF-κB+ activation within plaques. We explored the mechanism using a Vas-on-Chip adhesion assay using Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAoEC) stimulated with TNFα. We observed an impairment in the trafficking of miR-125b transfected THP-1 monocytes, accompanied by the downregulation of the CD11b/CD18 integrin and the CCR7 receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrated a direct regulation of the CCR7 receptor by miR-125b using a reporter plasmid construct (p_CCR7.WT) containing the 3’UTR region of CCR7 gene fused with a luciferase coding sequence. In addition, miR-125b transfected monocytes inhibited CCR7 cell migration induced by the CCL21 ligand but did not affect migration induced by others ligands such as MCP1. Finally, we confirmed the downregulation of CCR7 in coronary plaques in both ApoE-/- mice and patients with coronary artery disease.Conclusions Inhibiting miR-125b offers a novel therapeutic approach for ameliorating ATH that results in a reduction of macrophage content and plaque lesion size. This improvement occurs through the enhancement of monocyte trafficking via CCR7 that facilitates the exit of foam cells from the plaque.What is New?- We found evidences of a new therapeutic approach for atherosclerosis, in which miR-125b inhibition reduces macrophage content and plaque size.- We described the molecular mechanism underlying miR-125b, which involves regulating of monocyte trafficking to plaques and the downregulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7. CCR7 plays a crucial role in facilitating the egress of macrophages and foam cells from plaques, and its downregulation contribute to progression of ATH.- The results have been validated in a cohort of patients with coronary artery disease, where CCR7 expression was reduced in plaques.What are the clinical implications?- We highlight the pivotal role of monocyte trafficking in the inflammatory mechanism of atherosclerosis. Managing miR-125b/CCR7 signaling may improve the resolution of ATH promoting the exit of foam cells from plaque.- Inhibition of miR-125b in plaque macrophages represents a novel and promising therapeutic approach for cardiovascular disease."

AbstractPurpose Proton (1H)-MRSI via spatial-spectral encoding poses high demands on gradient hardware at ultra-high fields and high-resolutions. Rosette trajectories help alleviate these problems, but at reduced SNR-efficiency due to their k-space densities not matching any desired k-space filter. We propose modified rosette trajectories, which more closely match a Hamming filter, and thereby improve SNR performance while still staying within gradient hardware limitations and without prolonging scan time.Methods Analytical and synthetic simulations were validated with phantom and in vivo measurements at 7 T. The rosette and modified rosette trajectories were measured in five healthy volunteers in six minutes in a 2D slice in the brain. A 3D sequence was measured in one volunteer within 19 minutes. The SNR, linewidth, CRLBs, lipid contamination and data quality of the proposed modified rosette trajectory were compared to the rosette trajectory.Results Using the modified rosette trajectories, an improved k-space weighting function was achieved resulting in an increase of up to 12% in SNR compared to rosette’s dependent on the two additional trajectory parameters. Similar results were achieved for the theoretical SNR calculation based on k-space densities, as well as when using the pseudo-replica method for simulated, in-vivo and phantom data. The CRLBs improved slightly, but non-significantly for the modified rosette trajectories, while the linewidths and lipid contamination remained similar.Conclusion By improving the rosette trajectory’s shape, modified rosette trajectories achieved higher SNR at the same scan time and data quality."

We aim to identify distinct patient phenotypes among TKA candidates, and investigate their correlations with patient characteristics.Methods Between 2017-2021, 389 patients with 450 primary knee cases at a metropolitan public hospital were enrolled in a clinical quality registry. Demographics, clinical data, and the Veterans Rand 12 (VR-12) and Oxford Knee Score (OKS) were collected. Imputed data were utilised for the primary analysis, employing k-means clustering to identify four phenotypes. ANOVA assessed differences in scores between clusters, and nominal logistic regression determined relationships between phenotypes and patient age, sex, body mass index, and laterality.Results The sample comprised 389 patients with 450 primary knees. Phenotype 4 (Mild symptoms with good mental health) exhibited superior physical function and overall health. In contrast, patients in phenotype 2 (Severe symptoms with poor mental health) experienced the most knee pain and health issues. Phenotype 1 (Moderate symptoms with good mental health) reported high mental health scores despite knee pain and physical impairment. Patient characteristics significantly correlated with phenotypes; those in the Severe symptoms with poor mental health phenotype were more likely to be younger, female, have a higher BMI, and bilateral osteoarthritis (P<0.05).Conclusions This multidimensional analysis identified TKA patient phenotypes based on common PROMs, revealing associations with patient demographics. This approach has the potential to inform prognostic models, enhancing clinical decision-making and patient outcomes in joint replacement.Significance and Innovations This study leverages the power of machine learning to simultaneously analyse multiple patient-reported outcome measures, which is not utilised in traditional research in total knee arthroplastyFour distinct phenotypes were identified, and they demonstrated significant associations with patient demographicsThis method has potential for developing prognostic models in joint replacement, with the ability to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes."

To address this uncertainly, we investigated the heritability and genetic relationships between categorical and dimensional models of BD in a family sample.Methods Participants in the Amish-Mennonite Bipolar Genetics (AMBiGen) study were assigned categorical mood disorder diagnoses by structured psychiatric interview and completed the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), which assesses lifetime history of manic symptoms and associated impairment. Major MDQ dimensions were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in 726 participants. Heritability and genetic overlaps between categorical diagnoses and MDQ-derived dimensions were estimated with SOLAR-ECLIPSE within 432 genotyped participants.Results MDQ scores were significantly higher among individuals diagnosed with BD and related disorders, as expected, but varied widely among relatives. PCA suggested a three-component model for the MDQ. Heritability of the MDQ score was 30% (p<0.001), evenly distributed across its three principal components. Strong and significant genetic correlations were found between categorical diagnoses and most MDQ measures.Limitations Recruitment through probands with BD resulted in increased prevalence of BD in this sample, limiting generalizability. Unavailable genetic data reduced sample size for some analyses.Conclusion Significant heritability and high genetic correlations between categorical diagnoses and MDQ measures support a genetic continuity between dimensional and categorical models of BD."

The lifetime risk of MNM (LTR-MNM) quantifies the probability that a 15-year-old girl will experience a near miss before age 50, given current mortality and fertility levels. We compare LTR-MNM globally to reveal inequities in the cumulative burden of severe maternal morbidity across the reproductive life course.Methods We estimate the LTR-MNM for 40 countries with multi-facility, regional, or national data on the prevalence of MNM morbidity measured using World Health Organization (WHO) or modified WHO criteria of organ dysfunction from 2010 onwards (Central and Southern Asia=6, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia=9, Latin America and the Caribbean=10, Northern Africa and Western Asia=2, Sub-Saharan Africa=13). We also calculate the lifetime risk of severe maternal outcome (LTR-SMO) as the lifetime risk of maternal death or MNM.Findings The LTR-MNM ranges from a 1 in 1436 risk in China (2014) to 1 in 6 in Guatemala (2016), with a corresponding LTR-SMO from 1 in 887 to 1 in 5, respectively. The LTR-MNM is a 1 in 20 risk or higher in nine countries, seven of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. The LTR-SMO is a 1 in 20 risk or higher in 11 countries, eight of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. The relative contribution of the LTR-MNM to the LTR-SMO ranges from 42% in Angola to 99% in Japan.Interpretation There exists substantial global and regional inequity in the cumulative burden of severe maternal morbidity across the reproductive life course. The LTR-MNM is an important indicator to advocate for further global commitment to end preventable maternal morbidity. Finally, the LTR-SMO is an important tool to compare heterogeneity in the relative contribution of morbidity to the overall burden of maternal ill-health across the female reproductive life course, depending on countries’ stage in the obstetric transition.Funding This work was supported by U.G.’s PhD studentship from the UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/P000592/1]. This work was also supported by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme Marie Curie Fellowship (to J.M.A.) [grant agreement no. 896821], and Leverhulme Trust Large Centre Grant (to J.M.A. and A.P.).Evidence before this study We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and Global Health for English language studies reporting national, regional, or multi-facility estimates of the prevalence of life-threatening maternal morbidity (i.e., “maternal near miss” events), published from 2010 until 21 November 2023. Search terms included (1) “maternal near miss”/”severe (acute) maternal morbidity”/”life-threatening condition/complications” and (2) “prevalence”/”incidence”/ “ratio”/ “surveillance”. Our search revealed a dearth of population-level estimates: most existing prevalence data derive from (single) facility-based studies without accounting for births that occur outside of the facility. This bias may be substantial where institutional delivery rates are low. Second, existing global comparisons of the maternal near miss ratio indicate differences in the level of obstetric risk associated with an individual pregnancy only. But since women are at risk of experiencing a life-threatening complication with each pregnancy, existing data fail to account for differences in cumulative risk from repeat pregnancy.The lifetime risk of maternal near miss is a new indicator that attempts to address these deficits in the existing evidence base to better understand global inequities in the burden maternal near miss morbidity across women’s reproductive lives.Added value of this study We provide the first cross-country estimates of the lifetime risk of maternal near miss for 40 countries with multi-facility, regional, or national data on the prevalence of maternal near miss. We also calculate how the lifetime risk of maternal near miss compares to the lifetime risk of maternal death for a given country-year, and the relative contribution of morbidity to the lifetime risk of severe maternal outcome (the risk of death or near miss morbidity). This is the first study to do so.Implications of all the available evidence First, there is substantial global inequity in the risk of severe maternal morbidity across women’s reproductive lifetimes. By accounting for the cumulative risk from repeat pregnancy and women’s reproductive age survival, the lifetime risk of maternal near miss presents a clearer picture of cross-country disparities in the burden of near miss morbidity than prevalence data alone might suggest. Second, the composite risk that a girl will either die from a maternal cause or experience near miss morbidity during her lifetime is extremely high in many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. These findings provide a new lens through which to understand reproductive injustice, and a new opportunity to advocate for increased global commitment to end preventable maternal morbidity and mortality."

We evaluated the participants’ ability to complete critical actions that were developed based on best practices and relevant American Heart Association guidelines and the Neurocritical Care Society’s Emergency Neurological Life Support protocols. The primary outcome was the improvement in knowledge from a pre-course to post-course test. Secondary outcomes included participant reactions.Results Sixty trainees completed the simulation session in 8 groups. The mean sum of critical actions completed by trainees was 9.75/14 (70%). There was a moderate effect of the intervention on trainees’ knowledge from pre-test (mean 3.8, standard deviation (SD) = 0.3) to post-test (mean 4.3, SD=0.3). The simulation scenario was described as moderately realistic, very engaging, and extremely satisfactory. Following the workshop, all fellows endorsed an increase in proficiency and confidence in neurological emergency management.Conclusions Simulation-based workshops at national conferences are feasible and a potentially useful tool for safely educating a large audience of trainees who may not have access to high-fidelity simulation platforms at their institutions."

Cumulative exposure to heading and other impacts to the head was estimated from the playing history questionnaire. Concussion was self-reported and assessed with the BRAIN-Q tool. The primary outcome was cognitive function measured with the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC).Findings Data for a total of 199 males were available for analysis. No overall association was found between heading and/or other impacts to the head and cognitive function. Amongst forwards only, those in the fourth (highest) quartile of exposure to other impacts to the head had a significantly lower PACC score compared to those in the first quartile (• = -0.65, 95% C.I. -1.23, -0.07). For all players, self-reported concussions were associated with slightly lower cognitive function (• = -0.01; 95% C.I. -0.01, -0.001).Interpretation This study generally does not support an association between exposure to heading a football and poorer cognitive function among former male professional players. However, an association between the number of concussions sustained and poorer cognitive function was present, although the effect size is relatively small.Funding This study was funded with a grant of the Drake Foundation to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Evidence before this study There is increasing evidence for an association between sport-related concussion and poorer cognitive function later in life, in former athletes. In soccer, heading the ball is a common event, particularly for outfield players, and involves repetitive sub-concussive impacts. The association between exposure to heading and cognitive function later in life is not consistent in the literature.Added value of this study This study is the first to provide appropriately modelled exposure estimates of both heading the ball and other impacts to the head among soccer players. Our findings do not support an association between heading and poorer cognitive function later in life. However they do suggest an association between concussion and poorer cognitive function among soccer players, although the size of the effect is relatively small. Other impacts to the head, such as head-to-head collisions, that did not result in the clinical features of concussions were also shown to be associated with poorer cognitive function, but only among forwards.Implication of the available evidence These findings support a continuous focus on the prevention of concussion in all sports, including soccer, whilst the consequences of repeated exposure to head impacts need to be further explored. Methodologically, it would be advisable to harmonise the tools developed to estimate cumulative exposures to heading, to other head impacts, and to sport-related concussion, to increase comparability of results across studies, thus enabling a sound synthesis of the evidence."

It is plausible that these decision-making processes are further impaired in the context of HIV or pregnancy. In this cross-sectional study of 86 low-income women in Philadelphia, multivariable models showed that HIV was associated with decreased mental bandwidth (one of two measures) and lower risk aversion. Pregnancy was not associated with any decision-making factors. Viral suppression was associated with greater mental bandwidth (one of two measures), and antenatal care engagement with lower future discounting. Anti-poverty interventions may be particularly beneficial to improve health behaviors in the context of HIV."

Despite its efficacy in reducing morbidity and mortality, influenza vaccination rates remain low globally and in South Africa. Youth between the ages of 18-34 years are not prioritised for influenza vaccines although influenza surveillance in South Africa shows that individuals aged 19 to 44 present the highest asymptomatic episodes and the lowest medically attended illness. This creates an opportunity to investigate if and how vaccine demand can be created in the absence of clear imperatives to vaccinate. The study tests the effectiveness of tailored, context-specific education, community engagement, including community and social media to increase influenza vaccination uptake. Tailored, context-specific education, community engagement, reliable vaccine supply and free, localised access are all critical for improving perceptions of, increasing confidence in, and motivating uptake of vaccination. This study explores strategies to increase vaccine uptake amongst marginalised youth 18-34 years old in Soweto, South Africa, where influenza vaccines are not universally accessible through the public health system for this age group.Methods The Bambisana Study uses an innovative approach - including community influencers and social media - to increase uptake of influenza vaccines through designing and testing an integrated communications strategy targeted at marginalised youth in Soweto, South Africa. The Bambisana study uses a mixed methods pre-test, post-test intervention design to test the effects of the interventions.Conclusion and Significance Enhancing perceptions of, bolstering confidence in, and fostering uptake of vaccination relies heavily on the efficacy of yearly influenza vaccination initiatives, personalized education tailored to specific contexts, active community involvement, consistent vaccine availability, and easily accessible, cost-free distribution channels at the local level."

Clinical machine learning models have demonstrated substantial promise in supporting the diagnostic process in LMICs without relying on specialised or trained personnel. How well these models generalise to naïve regions is, however, underexplored. Here, we use a novel approach to assess the suitability and applicability of such clinical tools for diagnosing active convulsive epilepsy in settings beyond their original training contexts.Methods We sourced data from the Study of Epidemiology of Epilepsy in Demographic Sites dataset, which includes demographic information and clinical variables related to diagnosing epilepsy across five sub-Saharan African sites. For each site, we developed a region-specific (single-site) predictive model for epilepsy and evaluated its performance on other sites. We then iteratively added sites to a multi-site model and evaluated its performance on the omitted regions. Model performances and parameters were then compared across every permutation of sites. We used a leave-one-site-out cross-validation analysis to assess the impact of incorporating individual site data in the model.Results Single-site clinical models performed well within their own regions, but worse in general when evaluated on other regions (p<0.05). Model weights and optimal thresholds varied markedly across sites. When the models were trained using data from an increasing number of sites, mean internal performance decreased while external performance improved.Conclusions Clinical models for epilepsy diagnosis in LMICs demonstrate characteristic traits of ML models, such as limited generalisability and a trade-off between internal and external performance. The relationship between predictors and model outcomes also varies across sites, suggesting the need to update specific aspects of the model with local data before broader implementation. Variations are likely to be specific to the cultural context of diagnosis. We recommend developing models adapted to the cultures and contexts of their intended deployment and caution against deploying region- and culture-naïve models without thorough prior evaluation.Key pointsMachine learning-driven clinical tools are becoming more prevalent in low-resource settings; however, their general performance across regions is not fully established. Given their potential impact, it is crucial models are robust, safe and appropriately deployedModels perform poorly when making predictions for regions that were not included in their training data, as opposed to sites that wereModels trained on different regions can have different optimal parameters and thresholds for performance in practiceThere is a trade-off between internal and external performance, where a model with better external performance usually has worse internal performance but is generally more robust overallSEEDS collaboratorsAgincourt HDSS, South Africa: Ryan Wagner, Rhian Twine, Myles Connor, F.

Its use gained popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic as a rapid and non-invasive way to assess infection prevalence in a population. Public facing dashboards for SARS-CoV-2 were developed in response to the discovery that RNA biomarkers were being shed in faeces before symptoms. However, there is not a standard template or guidance for countries to follow. The aim of this research is to reflect on how currently available dashboards evolved during the pandemic and identify suitable content and rationale from these experiences.Methods and Results Interviews were carried out with implementers and users of dashboards for SARS-CoV-2 WW data across Europe and North America. The interviews addressed commonalities and inconsistencies in displaying epidemiological data of SARS-CoV-2, clinical parameters of COVID-19, data on variants, and data transparency. The thematic analysis identified WW dashboard elements that can facilitate standardization, or at least interoperability. These elements emphasise communication among developers under the same organization, open access for identified stakeholders, and data summarized with a time-intensive graphic analysis through normalizing at least by population. Simultaneous communication of clinical surveillance is recommended. More research is needed on flow and faecal indicators for normalization of WW data, and on the analysis and representation of variants.Discussion WW dashboard development between 2020-2023 provided a ‘real-time’ iterative process of data representation, and several recommendations have been identified. Communication of data through dashboards has the potential to support early warning systems for infectious diseases."

Although there is evidence supporting suboptimal decision-making in lupus and its association with glucocorticoids consumption, it is not clear what variables impact such decisions. The aim of this study is to explore how social, clinical, psychological, and demographic factors impact social and temporal decision-making in people with lupus. Through a within-subjects experimental-design, our participants responded to social, clinical, psychological, and demographic electronic questionnaires. Then, they participated in two behavioral economics experiments: the third-party dictator game, and the delay discounting task. Our results show that hostility, and age are essential predictors of social decisions, whereas obsessive-compulsiveness and anxiety better predict temporal decisions. These variables behave as expected, but anxiety shows unexpected results: most anxious people act patiently and prefer delayed but bigger rewards. Finally, clinical factors are critical decision predictors for social and temporal decisions. When people are in remission, they tend to impose higher punishment on those who violate the social norm, and they also tend to prefer immediate rewards. When taking glucocorticoids, they also prefer immediate rewards, and as the dosage of glucocorticoids intake increases, they tend to impose higher punishment on norm violators. Clinicians, researchers, and practitioners must consider the side effects of glucocorticoids on decision-making."

Such as, the results found significantly enhanced functional connectivity strength between inferior occipital gyrus (IOG)-lingual/fusiform gyrus as well as superior parietal lobule (SPL)-insula circuits in ADHD group compared to healthy group (HG) and BD group, which suggests impaired emotional facial perception and interoceptive processing in ADHD than BD adults. In addition, the connectivity between precuneus and fusiform was significantly lower in both of ADHD and BD group compared to HG and no significant difference was found between patient groups. This indicates similar neural patterns underlying the impairment in emotion classification and emotional experience for ADHD and BD adults.Conclusions Together these findings can promote the understanding of common and disorder-specific neural mechanism underlying emotion dysregulations and facilitate neuroimaging-based clinical evaluation for ADHD and BD adults."

Timely identification of the fetal red blood cell antigen genotype for the antigen to which the pregnant person is alloimmunized is vital for determining fetal risk for HDFN and guiding management. Presently in the US, recommended care is to determine fetal antigen genotype with reproductive partner testing and/or amniocentesis. This approach has many limitations, including availability of reproductive partner testing, risk of nonpaternity, and low uptake of invasive testing such as amniocentesis. These barriers to obtaining fetal antigen genotype information lead to pregnancies not at risk for HDFN undergoing burdensome monitoring and, in some cases, unnecessary intervention. PCR-based qualitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping is available in Europe, however, it is offered at later gestational ages, may require a repeat sample, has a higher frequency of inconclusive results for individuals of non-European ancestry, and entails logistical challenges related to shipping and insurance coverage for patients in the US. The availability of a NGS-based quantitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping in the US that is robust for diverse populations and applicable for singleton and twin pregnancies starting at 10 weeks gestation presents an opportunity to assess performance.Methods Patients with alloimmunized pregnancies undergoing clinical fetal antigen cfDNA analysis were recruited to the study along with the neonates resulting from the pregnancies. The laboratory issued the results prospectively as a part of clinical care. After delivery, neonatal buccal swabs were sent to an outside laboratory, blinded to the fetal cfDNA results, for antigen genotyping, and the results were compared. Concordance was reported for the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis for antigens to which the pregnant person was alloimmunized as well as for all antigens for which the pregnant person was genotype negative.Results We observed complete concordance between the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis result and neonatal genotypes for 503 calls, for 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV across a racial and ethnically diverse cohort.Conclusion This study demonstrates that cfDNA analysis for determining fetal antigen genotype is more accurate than real-life application of the current recommendations, ie., partner testing and amniocentesis, in a diverse US population. In addition, this noninvasive approach reduces barriers to obtaining timely, accurate information about fetal antigen genotype. These results support the routine implementation of fetal antigen cfDNA analysis to guide care of alloimmunized pregnancies in the US."

We sequenced and analyzed Oxford Nanopore long-read genomes of 68 individuals from the Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) with no previously identified diagnostic mutations from short-read sequencing. Using our optimized SV detection pipelines and 571 control long-read genomes, we detected 716 long-read rare (MAF < 0.01) SV alleles per genome on average, achieving a 2.4x increase from short-reads. To characterize the functional effects of rare SVs, we assessed their relationship with gene expression from blood or fibroblasts from the same individuals, and found that rare SVs overlapping enhancers were enriched (LOR = 0.46) near expression outliers. We also evaluated tandem repeat expansions (TREs) and found 14 rare TREs per genome; notably these TREs were also enriched near overexpression outliers. To prioritize candidate functional SVs, we developed Watershed-SV, a probabilistic model that integrates expression data with SV-specific genomic annotations, which significantly outperforms baseline models that don’t incorporate expression data. Watershed-SV identified a median of eight high-confidence functional SVs per UDN genome. Notably, this included compound heterozygous deletions in FAM177A1 shared by two siblings, which were likely causal for a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. Our observations demonstrate the promise of integrating long-read sequencing with gene expression towards improving the prioritization of functional SVs and TREs in rare disease patients."

We present two individuals with congenital myopathy and compound heterozygous variants (NM_001271208.2: c.2079C>A; p.(Cys693Ter) and c.21522+3A>G) in NEB. Transcriptomic sequencing on patient muscle revealed that the extended splice variant c.21522+3A>G causes exon 144 skipping. Nebulin isoforms containing exon 144 are known to be mutually exclusive with isoforms containing exon 143, and these isoforms are differentially expressed during development and in adult skeletal muscles. Patients MRIs were compared to the known pattern of relative abundance of these two isoforms in muscle. We propose that the pattern of muscle involvement in these patients better fits the distribution of exon 144-containing isoforms in muscle than with previously published MRI findings in NEB-related disease due to other variants. To our knowledge this is the first report hypothesizing disease pathogenesis through the alteration of isoform distributions in muscle."

A bias analysis quantitatively assesses how conclusions change under different assumptions about missingness using bias parameters which govern the magnitude and direction of the bias. Probabilistic bias analysis specifies a prior distribution for these parameters, explicitly incorporating available information and uncertainty about their true values. A Bayesian approach combines the prior distribution with the data’s likelihood function whilst a Monte Carlo approach samples the bias parameters directly from the prior distribution. No study has compared a Monte Carlo approach to a fully Bayesian approach in the context of a bias analysis to MNAR missingness.Methods We propose an accessible Monte Carlo probabilistic bias analysis which uses a well-known imputation method. We designed a simulation study based on a motivating example from the UK Biobank study, where a large proportion of the outcome was missing and missingness was suspected to be MNAR. We compared the performance of our Monte Carlo probabilistic bias analysis to a principled Bayesian probabilistic bias analysis, complete case analysis (CCA) and missing at random implementations of inverse probability weighting (IPW) and multiple imputation (MI).Results Estimates of CCA, IPW and MI were substantially biased, with 95% confidence interval coverages of 7–64%. Including auxiliary variables (i.e., variables not included in the substantive analysis which are predictive of missingness and the missing data) in MI’s imputation model amplified the bias due to assuming missing at random. With reasonably accurate and precise information about the bias parameter, the Monte Carlo probabilistic bias analysis performed as well as the fully Bayesian approach. However, when very limited information was provided about the bias parameter, only the Bayesian approach was able to eliminate most of the bias due to MNAR whilst the Monte Carlo approach performed no better than the CCA, IPW and MI.Conclusion Our proposed Monte Carlo probabilistic bias analysis approach is easy to implement in standard software and is a viable alternative to a Bayesian approach. We caution careful consideration of choice of auxiliary variables when applying imputation where data may be MNAR."

Here, RH5.1 was formulated with Matrix-M™ adjuvant to assess safety and immunogenicity in a malaria-endemic adult and pediatric population for the first time.Methods We conducted a Phase 1b, single-center, dose-escalation, age de-escalation, first-in-human trial of RH5.1/Matrix-M™ in Bagamoyo, Tanzania. Healthy adults (18-45 years) and infants (5-17 months) were recruited to receive the RH5.1/Matrix-M™ vaccine candidate in a variety of dosing regimens, including monthly dosing (0-1-2 month) or delayed booster dosing (0-1-6 month) using a 10 µg dose of RH5.1, or delayed fractional booster dosing (0-1-6 month) with the first two doses of RH5.1 at 50 µg and the third dose at 10 µg. All RH5.1 protein doses were formulated with 50 µg Matrix-M™ adjuvant. Primary outcomes for vaccine safety included solicited and unsolicited adverse events after each vaccination, along with any serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study period. Secondary outcome measures for immunogenicity included the concentration and avidity of anti-RH5.1 serum IgG antibodies by ELISA and their percentage growth inhibition activity (GIA) in vitro against P. falciparum parasites using purified IgG. All participants receiving at least one dose of vaccine were included in the primary analyses.Findings Between 25th January 2021 and 15th April 2021 a total of 60 adults and infants were enrolled; 57 of these completed the vaccination series, and 55 completed 22 months of follow-up post-third vaccination. Vaccinations were well-tolerated across both age groups. There were five SAEs involving four infant participants during the trial, none of which were deemed related to vaccination. RH5-specific T cell and serum antibody responses were induced by vaccination. The anti-RH5 serum IgG responses were significantly higher in the 5-17 month old infant groups as compared to adults. Serum antibody responses contracted over time post-third vaccination, but a similar hierarchy of responses across the age groups was maintained after 22 months follow-up (674 days post-third vaccination). Vaccine-induced anti-RH5 antibodies showed in vitro GIA with comparable functional quality across all age groups and dosing regimens. The highest anti-RH5 serum IgG responses were observed post-third vaccination in the 5-17 month old infants vaccinated with the 0-1-6 month delayed booster regimen using the 10 µg dose of RH5.1 (median 723 µg/mL; range: 450-1436 µg/mL), resulting in 100 % (11/11 infants) showing >60 % GIA following dilution of total IgG to 2.5 mg/mL (median 88 %; range: 73-97 %).Interpretation The RH5.1/Matrix-M™ vaccine candidate shows an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile and highly promising antibody immunogenicity in 5-17 month old infants residing in a malaria-endemic area. The 0-1-6 month delayed booster regimen in 5-17 month old infants induced the highest levels of functional GIA reported to-date following human vaccination, with all infants achieving a level of GIA previously associated with protective outcome against blood-stage P. falciparum challenge in non-human primates. These data support onward efficacy assessment of this vaccine candidate against clinical malaria in young African infants.Funding The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP).Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04318002."

We investigated CVR in genetic FTD and its relationship to cognition.METHODS CVR differences were assessed between 284 pre-symptomatic and 124 symptomatic mutation carriers, and 265 non-carriers, using resting-state fluctuation amplitudes (RSFA) on component-based and voxel-level RSFA maps. Associations and interactions between RSFA, age, genetic status, and cognition were examined using generalised linear models.RESULTS Compared to non-carriers, mutation carriers exhibited greater RSFA reductions, predominantly in frontal cortex. These reductions increased with age. The RSFA in these regions correlated with cognitive function in symptomatic and, to a lesser extent, pre- symptomatic individuals, independent of disease stage.DISCUSSION CVR impairment in genetic FTD predominantly affects frontal cortical areas, and its preservation may yield cognitive benefits for at-risk individuals. Cerebrovascular health may be a potential target for biomarker identification and disease-modifying efforts."

Long-read sequencing offers the advantage of better mappability and long-range phasing, which results in substantial improvements in germline SV detection. However, current long-read SV detection methods do not generalize well to the analysis of somatic SVs in tumor genomes with complex rearrangements, heterogeneity, and aneuploidy. Here, we present Severus: a method for the accurate detection of different types of somatic SVs using a phased breakpoint graph approach. To benchmark various short- and long-read SV detection methods, we sequenced five tumor/normal cell line pairs with Illumina, Nanopore, and PacBio sequencing platforms; on this benchmark Severus showed the highest F1 scores (harmonic mean of the precision and recall) as compared to long-read and short-read methods. We then applied Severus to three clinical cases of pediatric cancer, demonstrating concordance with known genetic findings as well as revealing clinically relevant cryptic rearrangements missed by standard genomic panels."

Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improved patient outcomes, pressing the need for reliable biomarkers. In this study, we aimed to identify miRNA candidates as potential biomarkers for Fabry disease using the KingFisher™ automated isolation method and NanoString nCounter® miRNA detection assay.Clinical serum samples were collected from both healthy subjects and Fabry disease patients. RNA extraction from the samples was performed using the KingFisher™ automated isolation method with the MagMAX mirVana™ kit or manually using the Qiagen miRNeasy kit. The subsequent NanoString nCounter® miRNA detection assay showed consistent performance and no correlation between RNA input concentration and raw count, ensuring reliable and reproducible results. Interestingly, the detection range and highly differential miRNA between the control and disease groups were found to be distinct depending on the isolation method employed. Nevertheless, enrichment analysis of miRNA-targeting genes consistently revealed significant associations with angiogenesis pathways in both isolation methods. Additionally, our investigation into the impact of enzyme replacement therapy on miRNA expression indicated that some differential miRNAs may be sensitive to treatment.Our study provides valuable insights to identify miRNA biomarkers for Fabry disease. While different isolation methods yielded various detection ranges and highly differential miRNAs, the consistent association with angiogenesis pathways suggests their significance in disease progression. These findings lay the groundwork for further investigations and validation studies, ultimately leading to the development of non-invasive and reliable biomarkers to aid in early diagnosis and treatment monitoring for Fabry disease."

We developed a statistically informed Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, RCT-Twin-GAN, that leverages relationships between covariates and outcomes and generates a digital twin of an RCT (RCT-Twin) conditioned on covariate distributions from a second patient population. We used RCT-Twin-GAN to reproduce treatment effect outcomes of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Blood Pressure Trial, which tested the same intervention but had different treatment effect results. To demonstrate treatment effect estimates of each RCT conditioned on the other RCT patient population, we evaluated the cardiovascular event-free survival of SPRINT digital twins conditioned on the ACCORD cohort and vice versa (SPRINT-conditioned ACCORD twins). The conditioned digital twins were balanced by the intervention arm (mean absolute standardized mean difference (MASMD) of covariates between treatment arms 0.019 (SD 0.018), and the conditioned covariates of the SPRINT-Twin on ACCORD were more similar to ACCORD than a sprint (MASMD 0.0082 SD 0.016 vs. 0.46 SD 0.20). Most importantly, across iterations, SPRINT conditioned ACCORD-Twin datasets reproduced the overall non-significant effect size seen in ACCORD (5-year cardiovascular outcome hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.88 (0.73-1.06) in ACCORD vs median 0.87 (0.68-1.13) in the SPRINT conditioned ACCORD-Twin), while the ACCORD conditioned SPRINT-Twins reproduced the significant effect size seen in SPRINT (0.75 (0.64-0.89) vs median 0.79 (0.72-0.86)) in ACCORD conditioned SPRINT-Twin). Finally, we describe the translation of this approach to real-world populations by conditioning the trials on an electronic health record population. Therefore, RCT-Twin-GAN simulates the direct translation of RCT-derived treatment effects across various patient populations with varying covariate distributions."

The protocol was pre-registered in PROSPERO. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the different treatments and study outcomes. Pooled hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were extracted from multivariate analyses, and a fixed or random effect model was used to pool the estimates. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the reasons for the heterogeneity.Results Thirty studies that included 46,572 patients with PCa were eligible for this meta-analysis. The results showed that, compared to PGG3, PGG4/5 was associated with a significantly increased risk of BCR. Compared with PSM ≤3 mm, PSM ≥3 mm was associated with a significantly increased risk of BCR. Compared with unifocal PSM, multifocal PSM (mF-PSM) was associated with a significantly increased risk of BCR. In addition, pT >2 was associated with a significantly increased risk of BCR compared to pT2. Notably, the findings were found to be reliable based on the sensitivity and subgroup analyses.Conclusions PGG at the PSM, length of PSM, number of PSMs, and pathological stage of the primary tumor in patients with PCa were found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of BCR. Thus, patients with these factors should be treated differently in terms of receiving adjunct treatment and more frequent monitoring. Large-scale, well-designed prospective studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to validate the efficacy of these risk factors and their effects on patient responses to adjuvant and salvage therapies and other oncological outcomes."

The vitreous fluid, situated in the posterior chamber of the eye behind the lens, holds a close relationship with the inner retina. Within this milieu, retinal cells secrete a diverse array of biomolecules, potentially harboring vital biomarkers. Among these, short, non-coding micro-RNAs (miRNAs) emerge as promising candidates. Their dynamic regulation by various gene signaling mechanisms, enhanced resistance to degradation, and secretion via separate exocytotic pathways make them particularly significant. Alterations in vitreal miRNA profiles may reflect pathological states and offer insights into disease etiology and progression.Abstract We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 22 peer-reviewed studies to assess the potential of vitreous miRNAs as biomarkers for retinal diseases. Our analysis demonstrates the potential utility of miRNAs as biomarkers in specific retinal pathologies. We show that miR-142, miR-9, and miR-21 emerge as robust biomarker candidates, displaying consistent and significant alterations correlating with proliferative vitreoretinal diseases. We also address the methodological challenges encountered in characterizing vitreous miRNA content, including the absence of standardized purification, amplification, and analysis protocols, as well as the scarcity of true control samples. Moreover, we make the case for the adoption of specific housekeeping genes and data normalization techniques to standardize miRNA analysis in the vitreous and explore potential methodologies for obtaining vitreous samples from healthy individuals.Conclusion Vitreous miRNAs hold promise as potential biomarkers for various retinal diseases, with miR-142, miR-9, and miR-21 emerging as particularly promising candidates.

This is typically achieved using RT-qPCR, which cannot differentiate replicant competent virus from non-viable virus or free RNA, limiting its utility as an endpoint. Culture based methods for SARS-CoV-2 exist; however, these are often insensitive and poorly standardised for use as clinical trial endpoints.We report optimisation of a culture-based approach evaluating three cell lines, three detection methods, and key culture parameters. We show that Vero-ACE2-TMPRSS2 (VAT) cells in combination with RT-qPCR of culture supernatants from the first passage provides the greatest overall detection of Delta viral replication (22/32, 68.8%), being able to identify viable virus in 83.3% (20/24) of clinical samples with initial Ct values <30. Likewise, we demonstrate that RT-qPCR using culture supernatants from the first passage of Vero hSLAM cells provides the highest overall detection of Omicron viral replication (9/31, 29%), detecting live virus in 39.1% (9/23) of clinical samples with initial Ct values < 25. This assessment demonstrates that combining RT-qPCR with virological end point analysis has utility in clinical trials of therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2; however, techniques may require optimising based on dominant circulating strain."

Little is known about the full burden of all-causes and leading cause-specific orphanhood and caregiver death beyond estimates from select causes.Objective To estimate 2000-2021 prevalence and incidence trends of all-cause orphanhood and caregiver death among children <18, by cause, age, race/ethnicity, and state.Data Sources National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) birth, death, race/ethnicity, and population data to estimate fertility rates and identify causes of death; 1983-1998 ICD-9 causes-of-death harmonized to ICD-10 classifications; 1999-2021 ICD-10 causes-of-death; CDC WONDER for state-specific estimates; and American Community Survey for grandparent population estimates.Data extraction and synthesis We extracted U.S. population-level death, birth, population size, race, and ethnicity data from NCHS and attributed to each deceased individual the average number of children left behind according to subgroup-specific fertility rates in the previous 0-17 years. We examined prevalence and incidence of orphanhood by leading causes-of-death, including COVID-19, the leading 5 causes-of-death for 1983-2021, and additional leading causes for ages 15-44. We extended these to obtain state-level outcome estimates.Main outcome measures National incidence and prevalence of orphanhood and caregiver death from 2000-2021, with orphanhood by year, parental cause-of-death and sex, child age, race/ethnicity, and state.Results From 2000-2021, orphanhood and custodial/co-residing grandparent caregiver loss annual incidence and prevalence trends increased 49.2% and 8.3%, respectively. By 2021, 2.9 million children (4% of all children) had experienced prevalent orphanhood and caregiver death. Populations disproportionately affected by orphanhood included 5.0% of all adolescents; 6.5%, 4.8%, and 3.9% respectively of non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White children; and children in New Mexico and Southern and Eastern States. Parental death due to drug overdose during 2020-2021 surpassed COVID-19 as the leading cause of incident and prevalent orphanhood during the COVID-19 pandemic.Conclusions and Relevance Policies, programs, and practices aimed at orphanhood prevention, identification, and linkage to services and support of nearly 3 million bereaved children are needed, foremost prioritizing rapidly increasing overdose-linked orphanhood.Key Point Question: What are U.S. trends in all-cause and cause-specific orphanhood and caregiver death among children <18?Findings: From 2000-2021, orphanhood and caregiver loss incidence and prevalence increased 49.2% and 8.3%, respectively.

They remain a significant global public health challenge. Despite this, the quality of care for orofacial clefts has not been investigated in global and country level.Objective We aimed to measure the quality of care index (QCI) for orofacial clefts worldwide.Methods We used the 2019 Global Burden of Disease data to create a multifactorial index (QCI) to assess orofacial clefts globally and nationally. By utilizing data on incidence, prevalence, years of life lost, and years lived with disability, we defined four ratios aimed at indirectly reflecting the quality of healthcare. Subsequently, we conducted a principal component analysis to identify the most critical variables that could account for the observed variability. The outcome of this analysis was defined as the QCI for orofacial clefts. Following this, we tracked the QCI trends among males and females worldwide, across various regions and countries, considering factors such as the socio-demographic index and World Bank classifications.Results Globally, the QCI for orofacial clefts exhibited a consistent upward trend from 1990 to 2019 (66.4 to 90.2) overall and for females (82.9 to 94.3) and males (72.8 to 93.6). In the year 2019, the top five countries with the highest QCI scores were as follows: Norway (QCI=99.9), Ireland (99.4), France (99.4), Germany (99.3), the Netherlands (99.3), and Malta (99.3). Conversely, the five countries with the lowest QCI scores on a global scale in 2019 were Somalia (59.1), Niger (67.6), Burkina Faso (72.6), Ethiopia (73.0), and Mali (74.4). Gender difference showed a converging trend from 1990 to 2019 (optimize gender disparity ratio (GDR): 123 vs. 163 countries), and the GDR showed a move toward optimization (between 0.95 and 1.05) in the better and worse parts of the world.Conclusion Despite the positive results regarding the QCI for orofacial clefts worldwide, some countries showed a slight negative trend."

We aimed to examine the impact of cervical cancer screening and treatment guidelines on screening, and follow-up adherence to guidelines.Methods Data from electronic health records and healthcare provision claims for 50 702 women was used. The annual rates of PAP tests, HPV tests and colposcopies during two guideline periods (2nd version 2012–2014 vs 3rd version 2016–2019) were compared. To assess the adherence to guidelines, the subjects were classified as adherent, over- or undertested based on the timing of the appropriate follow-up test.Results The number of PAP tests decreased and HPV tests increased during the 3rd guideline period (p < 0.01). During the 3rd guideline period, among 21–29-year-old women, the adherence to guidelines ranged from 38.7% (44.4…50.1) for ASC-US to 73.4% (62.6…84.3) for HSIL, and among 30–59-year-old from 49.0% (45.9…52.2) for ASC-US to 65.7% (58.8…72.7) for ASC-H. The highest rate of undertested women was for ASC-US (21–29y: 25.7%; 30–59y: 21.9%). The rates of over-tested women remained below 12% for all cervical pathologies observed. There were 55.2% (95% CI 49.7…60.8) of 21–24-year-old and 57.1% (95% CI 53.6…60.6) of 25–29-year-old women who received an HPV test not adherent to the guidelines.Conclusions Our findings highlighted some shortcomings in the adherence to guidelines, especially among women under 30. The insights gained from this study helps to improve the quality of care and thus, reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality."

ParticipantsWomen giving birth in a Belgian facility from March 1, 2020, to May 1, 2023, responded a validated online questionnaire based on 40 WHO standards-based quality measures organised in four domains: provision of care, experience of care, availability of resources, and organizational changes related to COVID-19.Primary and secondary outcome measures Quantile regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of QMNC; trends over time were tested with the Mann-Kendall test.Results 897 women were included in the analysis, 67%(n=601) with spontaneous vaginal birth, 13.3%(n=119) with instrumental vaginal birth and 19.7%(n=177) with cesarean section. We found high QMNC scores but also specific gaps in all domains of QMNC. On provision of care, 21.0%(n=166) of women who experienced labor and 14.7%(n=26) of women with a cesarean reported inadequate pain relief; 64.7%(n=74) of women with an instrumental birth reported fundal pressure and 72.3% (n=86) reported that forceps or vacuum cup was used without their consent. On experience of care, 31.1%(n=279) reported unclear communication, 32.9%(n=295) reported that they were not involved in choices,11.5%(n=104) stated not being treated with dignity and 8.1%(n=73) experienced abuse. Related to resources, almost half of the women reported an inadequate number of healthcare professionals (46.2%, n=414). The multivariable analyses showed significantly lower QMNC scores for women with an instrumental vaginal birth. Over time there was a significant increase in QMNC score for ‘experience of care’ and ‘key organizational changes due to COVID-19’.Conclusions and relevance Although overall QMNC scores were high, findings also suggest gaps in QMNC. Underlying causes of these gaps should be explored to design appropriate interventions and policies."

Bangladesh experienced its first reported outbreak in 2008. Despite a number of subsequent isolated outbreaks, culminating in an enormous nationwide epidemic in 2017, very little is known about the burden or dynamics of chikungunya within the country, and the risk factors for infection. We conducted a nationally representative seroprevalence survey in 2016 in 70 randomly selected communities across the country. Individuals provided blood samples, which were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies to CHIKV. We also trapped and speciated mosquitoes. We found that 69/2,938 (2.4%) of individuals were seropositive to CHIKV. Seropositive individuals were concentrated in the centre and south of the country. We found that being seropositive to dengue virus (aOR 3.11 [95% CIs: 1.17 – 24.45]) and male sex (aOR 0.29 [95% CIs: 0.01 – 0.96]), were significantly associated with CHIKV seropositivity, however, Aedes presence, income, and travel history were not. Using a spatial prediction model, we estimate that at the time of the study, 4.99 million people in the country had been infected with CHIKV. These findings highlight high population susceptibility prior to the major outbreak in 2017 and that historic outbreaks must have been spatially isolated."

The chi square test and logistic regression were applied to analyze the results in SPSS V.16 and p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significance.Result Adequate level of knowledge was found among 84.11% (95% CI: 81.52 to 86.70) of the adolescents. Positive attitude was seen among 60% of the adolescents (95% CI: 56.55 to 63.49). The percentage of adolescent consuming items was 84.50% (95% CI: 81.94 to 87.07). Odds of having adequate knowledge among respondents was twice (AOR=2.05, 95% CI: 1.12 to 3.76) more likely for those who were living with their parents. Female adolescents (AOR=2.51, 95% CI: 1.61 to 3.89), whose mother are homemaker (AOR=1.99, 95% CI: 1.04 to 3.58) and father are engaged in foreign employment (AOR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.04 to 4.21) were more likely to consume sugary items. Prevalence of overweight was seen among 6.38% (95% CI: 4.64 to 8.11) of respondents. Consumption was seen to be significant to the model overweight versus normal [OR=11.95 (95% CI: 1.61 to 88.42)].Conclusion Presence of adequate knowledge wasn’t the only and adequate factor for food selection. Family indulged interventions can be useful as familial factors seem to be affecting behavioral characteristics. Sugary foods and beverages are associated with overweight. Hence interventions focusing on dietary discipline is also recommended.STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDYThis study deviates the primary focus from range of processed foods items to sugary foods and beverages only. No such studies with sole focus on high calorie sugary foods have been found conducted in Nepal.Study was limited to a single municipality, whose results cannot be generalized for national context. However, it can apply in case of urban settings.Majority of the findings are based on self-reporting, which leaves enough space for under-reporting and recall bias. On the other hand, anthropometric measurements taken by research team was positive part of the study.Difficult to gauge the impact of the findings, because weight gain in adolescence phase varies as a function of age, maturation, and growth velocity not just consumption of sugary foods and beverages."

As an organization, it represents a global network of diverse stakeholders. Cochrane’s key organizational values include diversity and inclusion, to enable wide participation and promote access. However, the diversity of Cochrane review authorship has not been well summarized.Objective The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of country, region, language, and gender diversity in the authorship of Cochrane reviews.Methods We retrieved all published articles from the Cochrane Library (until November 6, 2023)—a web crawling technique that extracted pre-specified data fields, including publication date, review type, and author affiliations. We used E-utility calls to capture the data for non-Cochrane systematic reviews. We determined the country and region of affiliations and the gender of the first, corresponding, and last authors for Cochrane reviews, as well as the country and region of affiliations and the gender of the first authors for non-Cochrane reviews. Trends in geographical and gender diversity over time were evaluated using logistic regression. Fisher’s exact test was used for comparisons. The diversity of first authors between Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews was explored through visual presentation, Pearson’s product-moment correlation, and the Granger Causality Test. We used R for data collection and analysis.Results A total of 22681 citations were retrieved. The United Kingdom had the highest first-author representation (33.2%), followed by Australia (11.6%) and the United States (7.0%). We observed an increase in the proportion of first authors from non-English speaking countries, from 16.7% in 1996 to 42.8% in 2023. Female first authorship increased steadily, from 15.0% in 1996 to 55.6% in 2023. The proportion of first authors from lower-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) was highest in 2012 at 23.2%. Since then, it has decreased to 18.4% in 2023. Similarly, the proportion of last authors from LMICs decreased over time (25.0% in 1996 vs. 16.2% in 2023). Among review groups, Sexually Transmitted Infections and Consumers and Communication were the most and least diverse groups with 68.1% and 1.6% of first authors from LMICs, respectively. In terms of gender diversity, Fertility Regulation had the highest percentage of female first authors (72.1%). Urology (28.1%) had the lowest percentage of female first authors. In 2023, over half of the non-Cochrane reviews had first authors from non-English-speaking countries (n=14,589, 56.9%), 50.8% (n=13,014) had first authors from LMICs, and 42.3% (n=10,841) had female first authors. The Pearson’s product-moment correlations between Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews’ trends were 0.265 (P=0.450) for LMICs, 0.823 (P<0.001) for non-English speaking, 0.634 (P<0.001) Spanish-speaking, and 0.829 (P<0.001) for female first authorship.Conclusion Overall, this study found positive trends, with an increase in first authorship by individuals who were female and from non-English speaking countries. However, the representation of first authors from non-high-income countries decreased. Future research could further explore these trends, identifying potential barriers influencing access and participation of individuals and groups and assessing strategies that help promote diversity and inclusion."

Recent advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) improve the prospects for achieving this goal. However, many machine learning techniques are not explainable and fail to account for gene correlations. In this work, we develop a comprehensive set of explainable machine learning techniques to perform patient stratification for inflammatory bowel disease. We focus on Crohn’s disease (CD) and its subtypes: CD with deep ulcer, CD without deep ulcer and IBD-controls. We produce an interpretable probabilistic model over disease subtypes using Gaussian Mixture Modelling. We then apply class-contrastive and feature-attribution techniques to identify potential target genes and modules. We modify the widely used kernelSHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) algorithm to account for gene correlations. We obtain relevant gene modules for each disease subtype. We develop a class-contrastive technique to visually explain why a particular patient is predicted to have a particular subtype of the disease. We show that our results are relevant to the disease through Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and a review of the literature. We also uncover some novel findings, including currently uncharacterised genes. These approaches maybe beneficial, in personalised medicine, to inform decision-making regarding the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders. Our approach is model-agnostic and can potentially be applied to other diseases and domains where explainability and feature correlations are important."

However, the rate at which lrGS can increase molecular diagnostic yield for rare disease is not yet precisely characterized. We performed lrGS using Pacific Biosciences “HiFi” technology on 96 short-read-negative probands with rare disease that were suspected to be genetic. We generated hg38-aligned variants and de novo phased genome assemblies, and subsequently annotated, filtered, and curated variants using clinical standards. New disease-relevant or potentially relevant genetic findings were identified in 16/96 (16.7%) probands, eight of which (8/96, 8.33%) harbored pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Newly identified variants were visible in both srGS and lrGS in nine probands (∼9.4%) and resulted from changes to interpretation mostly from recent gene-disease association discoveries. Seven cases included variants that were only interpretable in lrGS, including copy-number variants, an inversion, a mobile element insertion, two low-complexity repeat expansions, and a 1 bp deletion. While evidence for each of these variants is, in retrospect, visible in srGS, they were either: not called within srGS data, were represented by calls with incorrect sizes or structures, or failed quality-control and filtration. Thus, while reanalysis of older data clearly increases diagnostic yield, we find that lrGS allows for substantial additional yield (7/96, 7.3%) beyond srGS. We anticipate that as lrGS analysis improves, and as lrGS datasets grow allowing for better variant frequency annotation, the additional lrGS-only rare disease yield will grow over time."

The role of gut microbiome in the Gut-Brain Axis and modulation of neuropsychiatric disease is increasingly recognized. The role of antenatal diet, particularly fiber intake, in mitigating maternal mental health disorders remains unexplored. The objective of this review is to investigate the association between maternal fiber intake and perinatal depression and anxiety (PDA).Methods A literature review of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted using appropriate keyword/MeSH terms for pregnancy, diet, fiber, and mental health. Observational and clinical trials published between 2015-2021 were included and data pertaining to dietary patterns (DP), food intake, mental health, and demographic data were extracted. The top three fiber-containing food groups (FG) per study were identified using a sum rank scoring system of fiber per 100 grams and fiber per serving size. The consumption of these top three fiber FGs was then ranked for each dietary pattern/group. Mental health outcomes for each study were simplified into three categories of improved, no change, and worsened. The relationship between top three fiber FGs consumed within each DP and mental health outcomes was analyzed using Spearman’s correlation.Results Thirteen of 52 studies met inclusion criteria. Ten (76.9%) studies assessed DPs (7 examined depression only, 2 examined depression and anxiety, and 1 examined anxiety only). Seven (53.9%) studies reported at least one significant positive relationship between mental health outcomes and DPs while 3 reported at least one negative outcome. Three (23.1%) studies compared intake of different food groups between depressed and non-depressed groups. In studies of DPs, the average consumption ranking of the top 3 fiber FGs, bore a significant inverse association with mental health outcomes [r=-0.419(95%CI: – 0.672—0.078)] p=0.015. In studies comparing intake of different FGs between depressed and non-depressed groups, consumption of top-ranking fiber foods was higher in the non-depressed groups, but significantly higher in 4 of the 10 high fiber FGs.Conclusion This study reframes findings from previously published studies of maternal diet and mental health outcomes to focus on fiber intake specifically, using a fiber ranking system. A significant correlation between lower intake of fiber and poorer mental health outcomes warrants further investigation in future studies."

Detecting extracellular vesicles (EVs) in blood may result in finding a diagnostic biomarker that reflects the depressive stage of patients with MDD. Here, we report the results on the glycosylation pattern of enriched plasma EVs from patients with MDD and age-matched healthy subjects. In this cohort, the levels of Triticum vulgaris (wheat germ) agglutinin (WGA), N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, sialic acid) - binding lectin, were significantly decreased in patients with MDD in depressive state compared to healthy subjects (area under the curve (AUC): 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 - 0.97)) and in remission state (AUC: 0.88 (95% CI 0.72 - 1.00)). Furthermore, proteome analysis revealed that the von Willebrand factor (vWF) was a significant factor recognized by WGA. WGA-binding vWF antigen differentiated patients with MDD versus healthy subjects (AUC: 0.92 (95% CI 0.82 - 1.00)) and the same patients with MDD in depressive versus remission state (AUC: 0.98 (95% CI 0.93 - 1.00)). In this study, the change patterns in the glycoproteins contained in plasma EVs support the usability of testing to identify patients who are at increased risk of depression during antidepressant treatment."

We identified 2,745 transgender individuals using a previously validated computable phenotype and 54,900 matched cisgender individuals. We calculated the prevalence of cancer and pre-cancer related to human papillomavirus (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tobacco, alcohol, lung, breast, colorectum, and built multivariable logistic models to examine the association between gender identity and the presence of cancer or pre-cancer. Results indicated similar odds of developing cancer across gender identities, but transgender individuals exhibited significantly higher risks for pre-cancerous conditions, including alcohol-related, breast, and colorectal pre-cancers compared to cisgender women, and HPV-related, tobacco-related, alcohol-related, and colorectal pre-cancers compared to cisgender men. These findings underscore the need for tailored interventions and policies addressing cancer health disparities affecting the transgender population."

The majority of patients have a mild course of dengue fever (DF) disease, however a proportion of infected individuals develop much more severe dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) resulting in circulatory collapse and multiorgan failure due to increased vascular permeability. Early detection of individuals likely to develop severe disease could lead to improved outcomes for patients, and help use healthcare resources more efficiently. At present there are no reliable markers during the earlier stages of infection that indicate which patients will go on to develop DHF. Our study was aimed at identifying proteins that are differentially regulated early during disease in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) of patients who subsequently develop DHF. Such proteins may also point at cellular pathways implicated in developing vascular leakage. PBMC were isolated from patients with a confirmed dengue infection, lysed and subjected to tandem mass tag mass spectrometry. One hundred and sixty proteins were differentially expressed in DENV-infected samples compared to healthy controls. These were mainly involved in type I interferon signaling, cytokine response, phagocytosis, haemostasis and cell adhesion. PBMC from DHF patients differentially expressed 90 proteins compared to individuals with DF; these were involved in down-regulation of platelet activation and aggregation, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton arrangement pathways. Proteins involved in oxidative stress and p38 MAPK signaling were upregulated in DHF samples during early infection compared to DF samples. The proteins reported here that are differentially regulated in PBMC early during infection could potentially serve as biomarkers to identify patients at risk of developing DHF at an early disease stage. This study also provides important observations on pathways implicated in severe DENV infection."

The cough sounds carry information about the respiratory system and bulbar involvement. Our goal was to explore the association between cough sound characteristics and the respiratory and bulbar functions in ALS.Methods This was a single-center, cross-sectional, and case-control study. On-demand coughs from ALS patients and healthy controls were collected with a smartphone. A total of 31 sound features were extracted for each cough recording using time-frequency signal processing analysis. Logistic regression was applied to test the differences between patients and controls, and in patients with bulbar and respiratory impairment. Support vector machines (SVM) were employed to estimate the accuracy of classifying between patients and controls and between patients with bulbar and respiratory impairment. Multiple linear regressions were applied to examine correlations between cough sound features and clinical variables.Results Sixty ALS patients (28 with bulbar dysfunction, and 25 with respiratory dysfunction) and forty age- and gender-matched controls were recruited. Our results revealed clear differences between patients and controls, particularly within the frequency-related group of features (AUC 0.85, CI 0.79- 0.91). Similar results were observed when comparing patients with and without bulbar dysfunction; and with and without respiratory dysfunction. Sound features related to intensity displayed the strongest correlation with disease severity.Discussion We found a good relationship between specific cough sound features and clinical variables related to ALS functional disability. The findings relate well with some expected impact from ALS on both respiratory and bulbar contributions to the physiology of cough. Finally, our approach could be relevant for clinical practice, and it also facilitates home-based data collection."

However, the prevalence of hypertension in this population remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension and associated factors among adults living in internally displaced people (IDP) camps around Baidoa.Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted, recruiting displaced persons in camps aged 18 years or older without a prior diagnosis of hypertension or current use of anti-hypertensive therapy. A standardized questionnaire was administered, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Hypertension was defined as two consistent measurements of systolic blood pressure ≥140mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90mmHg, taken 4 hours apart. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors independently associated with undiagnosed hypertension. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.Results A total of 240 participants were enrolled, with a mean age of 39.4 ± 12.8 years. The majority were female (83.3%, n=199) and urban dwellers (88.3%, n=212). The prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension was 16.7% (n=40). Of the participants with hypertension, 40% (n=16) were younger than 40 years. Factors associated with undiagnosed hypertension included age >50 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 7.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.9 to 25.6, p=0.003), male gender (aOR: 4.2, 95% CI: 1.5 to 11.1, p=0.005), tobacco consumption (aOR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.1 to 6.0, p=0.021), and being overweight (aOR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.5 to 8.8, p=0.005).Conclusion Approximately one in six adult IDPs living in camps around Baidoa had undiagnosed hypertension, with a disproportionately high burden among those younger than 40 years. Further larger multi-centric studies are warranted to validate these findings."

Diagnosis can be done by high-speed- videomicroscopy using nasal epithelial cells (NECs) obtained via brushings. This procedure can be painful, especially for children. The use of lidocaine is proposed to reduce this pain; however, it is not clear whether lidocaine changes ciliary beating frequency (CBF) or pattern (CBP) in the subsequent high-speed-videomicroscopy.Objective The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of lidocaine on the CBF and the CBP of differentiated, air-liquid-interface cultured NECs.Methods NECs from healthy volunteers were obtained via brushings and cultured at the air-liquid-interface. After differentiation, lidocaine or isotonic saline (IS, control) were added apically for 1 or 5 min each and CBF (in top view of whole inserts and side views of scratched cells) and CBP (only side view) were assessed and recorded up to 150 min. CBF was computed and CBP was analysed semiquantitatively.Results Lidocaine as well as IS increased the CBF in the top view approach significantly compared to baseline. However, we found no significant differences between lidocaine and IS (control) treatment. Additionally, no effect of lidocaine on CBF, CBP, amplitude, inter- and intracellular coordination or transport was seen in the side view approach."

Specifically, it has been postulated that polymorphic microbiomes can either induce or inhibit some of the hallmark capacities (particularly, immune evasions) via their intersecting with two other enabling characteristics (genome instability and mutation, and tumor promoting inflammation). The net effects of the microbiomes can be either protective or deleterious effects on cancer development, malignant progression, and therapy responses. Nevertheless, there is not yet a mechanistic interpretation for IOM, especially regarding intratumoral microbiomes. Here, we propose to interpret the observed relationships, in which microbiomes can be complicit, bystanders, or in rare cases, oncomicrobes or foes, to either cancer cells or immune cells, possibly depend on specific microbial taxon, with the AKP (Anna Karenina principle)—that all heathy tissue microbiomes should be similar, and tumor microbiomes should be dissimilar with each other, in analogy with Leo Tolstoy’s aphorism that “all happy families look alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”. Given potentially double-sword nature of microbes, both AKP and anti-AKP should exist in the IOM axis. We test the AKP with microbiome datasets of 20+ cancer types from the TCGA database and find that the ratio of AKP/anti-AKP is about 3:1.Key PointsWe propose to interpret the observed relationships, in which microbiomes can be complicit, bystanders, or in rare cases, oncomicrobes or foes, to either cancer cells or immune cells, possibly depend on specific microbial taxon, with the AKP (Anna Karenina principle).We postulate that all heathy tissue microbiomes should be similar, and tumor microbiomes should be dissimilar with each other, in analogy with Leo Tolstoy’s aphorism that “all happy families look alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”.We test the AKP with microbiome datasets of 20+ cancer types from the TCGA database and find that the ratio of AKP/anti-AKP is about 3:1."

Fecal calprotectin is an established biomarker for ulcerative colitis (UC), one of the main IBD diseases, which provides indications of the presence and severity of inflammation in the digestive tract. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) as a gold standard approach for fecal calprotectin detection is time-consuming and impractical in point-of-care settings. Moreover, obtaining fecal samples from patients is challenging and inhibits longitudinal monitoring. To overcome these limitations, we designed a new approach for detecting calprotectin which leverages clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas technology. We successfully developed a portable tube-based CRISPR/Cas assay for point-of-care testing of calprotectin. This assay showed a detection range from 1-10000 ng/mL (over 4 log units), using both fluorescent and colorimetric analytical techniques. The established assay was further validated through measurements in mucosal samples obtained in an anesthetised preclinical rodent model of UC, with 2-3 times higher calprotectin concentration detected in UC rat samples compared to that of healthy control animals. This point-of-care test may provide a rapid, precise, and user-friendly approach for the diagnosis and monitoring of IBD through mucosal sample testing."

A systematic review,"AbstractBackground Variability in motor recovery after stroke represents a major challenge in its understanding and management. While functional MRI has traditionally been used to address post-stroke motor function in relation to clinical outcome, it lacks details about movement characteristics linked to observed brain activations. Combining fMRI with detailed information of motor function by using motion capture (mocap) might provide clinicians with additional information about mechanisms of motor impairment after stroke.Objectives We aimed to identify fMRI and mocap coupling approaches and to evaluate their potential contribution to the understanding of motor function post-stroke.Method A systematic literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines, on studies using fMRI and mocap in post-stroke individuals. We assessed the internal, external, statistical, and technological validity of each study. Data extraction included study design and analysis procedures used to couple brain activity with movement characteristics.Results Of the 404 studies found, 23 were included in the final review. The overall study quality was moderate (0.6/1). The majority of studies focused on the upper limb, using a wide variety of motor tasks. Half of the studies performed a statistical analysis between movement and brain activity by either using kinematics as variables during group or individual level regression or correlation. This permitted establishing a link between motor characteristics and brain activations. Mocap was also integrated without statistical confrontation, to compare results between fMRI and kinematics, or to incorporate real-time movement information to supply external devices, like motor feedback.Conclusion Our review suggests that the simultaneous use of fMRI and Mocap provides new insights compared with conventional fMRI analysis. It allows a better understanding of post-stroke motor function, although being still subject to practical and technological limitations. Further research is needed to optimize and standardize both data measurement and processing procedures."

However, evaluation of normal and pathological fetal brain development is still a challenge due to the complexity of the extraction and analysis of fetal neural activity. Fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG) is currently the only available technique to record fetal neural activity with a time resolution equivalent to that of EEG. However, the signatures and characteristics of fetal spontaneous neural activity are still largely unknown. Benefiting from progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we aimed to transfer premature EEG to fMEG, to characterize the manifestation of spontaneous activity using the knowledge obtained from premature EEG.In this study, 30 high-resolution EEG recordings from premature newborns and 44 fMEG recordings, both from 34 to 37 weeks of gestation (wGA) were used to develop a transfer function to predict the spontaneous neural activity of the fetus. After preprocessing, bursts of spontaneous activity were detected using the non-linear energy operator over both EEG and fMEG signals. Next, we proposed a CycleGAN-based model to transform the premature EEG to fMEG and vice versa and evaluated its performance with both time and frequency measurements on both forward and inverse conversions.In the time domain, the values were similar for the mean square error (< 5%) and correlation (0.91 ± 0.05 and 0.89 ± 0.08) for the EEG to fMEG and fMEG to EEG transformations between the original data and that generated by CycleGAN. However, considering the frequency content, the CycleGAN-based model modulated the frequency content of EEG to MEG transformed signals relative to the original signals by increasing the power, on average, in all frequency bands, except for the slow delta frequency band. Our developed model showed promising potential to generate a priori signatures of fMEG manifestations related to spontaneous neural activity. Collectively, this study represents the first steps toward identifying neurobiomarkers of fetal brain development."

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging enhances tissue characterization capability resulting in a better myocardial scar assessment over other noninvasive imaging modalities. However, the diagnostic values of f-QRS on non-ischemic scars and f-QRS from EKG with a 015-40 Hz low-pass filter (routine filter in clinical practice) are unknown. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of f-QRS (from EKG with 0.15-40 and 0.15-100 Hz low-pass filters) for detecting any myocardial scars (both ischemic and non- ischemic) assessed by 3.0 Tesla CMR.Methods This cross-sectional study included patients who underwent a 3.0 Tesla CMR scan from May 2020 to May 2023. A 12-lead EKG with 0.15-40 and 0.15-100 Hz low-pass filters, performed on the same day of the CMR scan, was assessed for the presence of f-QRS. The ECG leads were divided into 3 categories (e.g., anterior leads V1-V4; lateral leads I, aVL, V5-V6; and inferior leads II, III, aVF). The f-QRS was defined as the presence of R’ wave or notching in the nadir of the S wave in 2 contiguous leads. The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of f-QRS from EKG in myocardial scar detection in the corresponding left ventricle (LV) segments. The secondary outcomes were to compare the diagnostic performance of f-QRS in detecting ischemic scars and non-ischemic scars, the diagnostic performance between f-QRS diagnosed from 0.15-40 and 0.15-100 Hz low-pass filters, and the diagnostic performance of f-QRS presented in 2 consecutive leads and f-QRS presented in solitary lead.Results The study involved 1,692 participants with a median age of 67 (IQR: 59-85) years old and 52.5% males. Myocardial scars were found in 826 (49%) participants. Male, history of CAD, and myocardial scars were significantly more frequent in the participants with f- QRS (59.4% vs 46.0%, 26.4% vs 20.6%, and 48.9% vs 37.3%, respectively), while median LVEF was lower (61%, IQR 47, 66 vs 62%, IQR 55, 68; p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUC of f-QRS from EKG with 0.15-100 Hz low-pass filter for detecting myocardial scars were 25.6%, 88.7%, 45.1%, 76.8%, and 0.57 for anterior segments; 22.1%, 91.5%, 36.8%, 84.1%, and 0.57 for lateral segments; and 42.9%, 63.4%, 36.9, 68.9%, and 0.53 for inferior segments. The sensitivity, PPV, and positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of f-QRS were higher for detecting non- ischemic scars while specificity, NPV, negative likelihood ratio (LR-), and AUC were not significantly different. The f-QRS from 0.15-100 Hz showed a higher sensitivity but lower specificity, PPV, and LR+ for all LV segments. The f-QRS presented in the solitary lead showed a higher sensitivity with a lower specificity, PPV, and LR+.Conclusion This study demonstrates a high specificity and negative predictive value of f- QRS from a 12-lead EKG with 0.15-40 and 0.15-100 Hz low-pass filters in diagnosing myocardial scars when correlated to the corresponding LV segments.Download figureOpen in new tab"

Early detection of ASD, particularly in girls who are often diagnosed late, can aid long-term development for children. We aimed to develop machine learning models for predicting ASD diagnosis in children, both boys and girls, using child-mother linked electronic health records (EHRs) data from a large clinical research network. Model features were children and mothers’ risk factors in EHRs, including maternal health factors. We tested XGBoost and logistic regression with Random Oversampling (ROS) and Random Undersampling (RUS) to address imbalanced data. Logistic regression with RUS considering a three-year observation window for children’s risk factors achieved the best performance for predicting ASD among the overall study population (AUROC = 0.798), boys (AUROC = 0.786), and girls (AUROC = 0.791). We calculated SHAP values to quantify the impacts of important clinical and sociodemographic risk factors."

Minimally invasive approaches that target the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and spare neocortex are increasingly used, but a knowledge gap remains in how to assess memory and language risk from these procedures. We retrospectively compared results of two versions of the Wada test, the intracarotid artery (ICA-Wada) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA-Wada) approaches, with respect to predicting subsequent memory and language outcomes, particularly after stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy (SLAH). We included all patients being considered for SLAH who underwent both ICA-Wada and PCA-Wada at a single institution. Memory and confrontation naming assessments were conducted using standardized neuropsychological tests to assess pre- to post-surgical changes in cognitive performance. Of 13 patients who initially failed the ICA-Wada, only one patient subsequently failed the PCA-Wada (p=0.003, two-sided binomial test with p0=0.5) demonstrating that these tests assess different brain regions or networks. PCA-Wada had a high negative predictive value for the safety of SLAH, compared to ICA-Wada, as none of the patients who underwent SLAH after passing the PCA-Wada experienced catastrophic memory decline (0 of 9 subjects, p<.004, two-sided binomial test with p0=0.5), and all experienced a good cognitive outcome. In contrast, the single patient who received a left anterior temporal lobectomy after failed ICA- and passed PCA-Wada experienced a persistent, near catastrophic memory decline. On confrontation naming, few patients exhibited disturbance during the PCA-Wada. Following surgery, SLAH patients showed no naming decline, while open resection patients, whose surgeries all included ipsilateral temporal lobe neocortex, experienced significant naming difficulties (Fisher’s exact test, p<.05). These findings demonstrate that (1) failing the ICA-Wada falsely predicts memory decline following SLAH, (2) PCA-Wada better predicts good memory outcomes of SLAH for MTLE, and (3) the MTL brain structures affected by both PCA-Wada and SLAH are not directly involved in language processing."

There is a paucity of data on clinical characteristics and treatment for Leptospirosis Pulmonary Haemorrhage Syndrome (LPHS).Methodology and principal findings A retrospective cohort study was conducted including all patients with LPHS treated in the medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU), at National Hospital Sri Lanka from 2019 to 2022 to describe the clinical characteristics and factors related to poor outcomes. Survival of patients who received different treatment modalities for LPHS was compared.Seventy patients were studied with a mean age of 42.69 ± 27.84 years and 61 (87.1%) males. Forty-nine (70%) were mechanically ventilated and 16 (22.9%) died. Higher heart rate, higher lactate, lower pH on admission to ICU, and requirement of blood product transfusion were associated with increased mortality. Patients were treated with plasmapheresis (PLEX), intranasal desmopressin (DDAVP), and intravenous steroids alone or in combination as the specific treatment for LPHS. Seven (10%) patients were treated with PLEX alone, 13 (18.6%) with PLEX + DDAVP, 46 (65.7%) with PLEX + DDAVP + steroids, and 4(5.7%) were treated with steroids alone. All patients who received the PLEX and DDAVP combination survived. There were 11 (23.9%) deaths in the PLEX+ DDAVP + steroids group, 3 (49.2%) in the PLEX alone group, and 2 (50%) in the steroids alone group. Mortality was least when PLEX was done for 3 days. Twenty-five (35.7%) patients developed hospital-acquired infections and risk factors were mechanical ventilation and longer ICU stay.Conclusions The presence of tachycardia, acidosis, and high lactate predicted death in LPHS. PLEX and DDAVP combination had better survival than other treatments alone or in combination for LPHS. Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to identify the role of PLEX and DDAVP in treating LPHS.Author Summary Leptospirosis, a tropical infection causes multiple organ injury. Bleeding into the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) in leptospirosis is poorly studied. There is no established treatment for pulmonary haemorrhage in leptospirosis (LPHS). A large cohort of LPHS patients treated in a medical ICU in Sri Lanka was studied to identify clinical characteristics and outcomes. The presence of higher heart rate, high lactate, lower pH, need for blood product, and intravenous tranexamic acid were identified as risk factors for death. We compared different treatment modalities used for the treatment of LPHS. In addition to standard treatment with antibiotics and supportive care, a combination of steroids, plasma exchange (PLEX), and intranasal desmopressin (DDAVP) were used to treat LPHS. Mortality was least when patients were treated with DDAVP + PLEX. The optimum duration of PLEX was 3 days. Clinical trials are urgently needed to identify the benefit of PLEX and DDAVP in the treatment of LPHS."

Considering values and preferences respects the rights of citizens to participate in health decision-making and ensures that guidelines align with the needs and priorities of the communities they are intended to serve. Early anecdotal reports suggest that COVID-19 public health guidelines did not consider values and preferences.Objective To capture and characterize whether and how COVID-19 public health guidelines considered values and preferences.Methods We performed a systematic review of COVID-19 public health guidelines. We searched the eCOVID19 RecMap platform—a comprehensive international catalog of COVID-19 guidelines—up to July 2023. We included guidelines that made recommendations addressing vaccination, masking, isolation, lockdowns, travel restrictions, contact tracing, infection surveillance, and school closures. Reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to review guidelines for consideration of values and preferences.Results Our search yielded 129 eligible guidelines, of which 43 (33.3%) were published by national organizations, 73 (56.6%) by international organizations, and 14 (10.9%) by professional societies and associations. Twenty-six (20.2%) guidelines considered values and preferences. Among guidelines that considered values and preferences, most did so to assess the acceptability of recommendations (23; 88.5%) and by referencing published research (24; 92.3%). Guidelines only occasionally engaged laypersons as part of the guideline development group (6; 23.1%). None of the guidelines performed systematic reviews of the literature addressing values and preferences.Conclusion Most COVID-19 public health guidelines did not consider values and preferences. When values and preferences were considered, it was suboptimal. Disregard for values and preferences in guidelines might have partly contributed to divisive and unpopular COVID-19 policies. Given the possibility of future health emergencies, we recommend guideline developers identify efficient methods for considering values and preferences in crisis situations."

However, Clopidogrel responsiveness shows variability based on CYP2C19 polymorphism. Therefore, we planned a study with an objective of evaluating safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a novel thienopyridine antiplatelet agent AT-10 in healthy Indian subjects in comparison with standard dosage regimen of Clopidogrel based on their CYP2C19 genotyping.Methods Two CYP2C19 genotype based groups were identified i.e., Poor Metabolizer and Extensive Metabolizers with 20 subjects in each group (N=40) for participating in a randomized, two period, cross-over study. Each study period lasted 6 days including administration of loading and maintenance doses of AT-10 (40mg/10mg) or Clopidogrel (300mg/75mg). The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed on day 1 and day 6 at several time intervals.Results Overall result of pharmacodynamic parameters showed that, mean % Inhibition of Platelet Aggregation between AT-10 and Clopidogrel in all subjects at Post-dose 6hr (loading dose) (AT-10: Clopidogrel; 73.30% vs. 18.53%) and Post-dose 6 hr on Day 6 (maintenance dose) (AT-10: Clopidogrel; 83.41% vs. 51.19 %) obtained from the AT-10 group was significantly higher than the Clopidogrel group. Further, %inhibition of platelet aggregation from AT-10 treatment in poor metabolizer group was significantly higher than the Clopidogrel treatments in extensive metabolizer group.Overall pharmacokinetic comparison in all subjects indicates that AT-10 gives greater exposure to active Metabolite MP-H4 than Clopidogrel.Conclusion AT-10 may emerge as a promising anti-platelet drug and can be further developed in clinical studies for the unmet medical needs of cardiovascular diseases. CTRI Registration: CTRI/2021/03/032206Clinical PerspectivesAT-10 (2-oxo-Clopidogrel) is a novel thienopyridine P2Y12 inhibitor under clinical development in India.It is a Clopidogrel derivative that is metabolically converted to produce the active thiol metabolite similar to Clopidogrel.The response to AT-10 was found unaffected by genetic CYP2C19 polymorphisms to the extent of its influence in Clopidogrel, thus eliminating the need for characterization of Clopidogrel responsiveness and thereby maintaining effectiveness in all patients, including those patients who are identified as CYP2C19 poor and intermediate metabolizers.Further studies are required to investigate the influence of CYP2C19 functional polymorphisms on the response to AT-10 dose in diverse clinical settings, and especially on the risk of recurrent thrombotic events during AT-10 treatment as compared to Clopidogrel therapy."

Prodrugs, which require activation by tumor associated enzymes (TAEs), are a rapidly emerging approach for targeted therapeutics. SULT1A1, a sulfotransferase enzyme and TAE, is over-expressed in about 5-15% of cancer patients including breast, prostate and renal cell carcinoma (RCC); however, it is either not expressed or expressed at low level in most normal tissue. Bioinformatic RNA analyses revealed that SULT1A1 over-expression in tumors is correlated with worse patient prognosis. We have identified a new compound, FIS103, which is a small molecule anti-cancer prodrug that is activated by SULT1A1 once internalized. This class of compounds, N-benzyl indole carbinols (N-BICs), cause rapid cell death by inducing widespread non-specific covalent alkylation of proteins in the cancer cell. We report that FIS103 displays potent antitumor activity in SULT1A1 over-expressing RCC cell lines (A498 and Caki-1). Contrarily, low SULT1A1 expressing RCC cells (786-O and ACHN) did not show any antitumor effects, which suggests low FIS103 toxicity in the absence of SULT1A1. In silico modeling validated the predicted SULT1A1-FIS103 interaction. Furthermore, FIS103 demonstrates potent SULT1A1-dependent antitumor activity in NU/J mouse xenografts injected with A498 cells. Remarkably, the flank tumors in mice regressed to non-measurable 14 days post-FIS103 treatment and did not regrow through the study conclusion. Additionally, SD rats treated with FIS103 once daily for 14 days demonstrated a promising liver toxicity profile with serum liver enzymes falling within the normal range and histopathology analysis indicated no difference between FIS103 or vehicle treated rats. We hereby demonstrate that FIS103 may have the potential to improve survival as well as quality of life of RCC patients and its application could be extended to other SULT1A1 expressing cancers."

We describe the COVID-19 experiences of hypertensive patients in Colombia and Jamaica and discuss factors associated with vaccine acceptance.Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2021 and February 2022 in 4 randomly selected primary care clinics in Colombia and 10 primary care clinics in Jamaica. Participants in Colombia were randomly selected from an electronic medical record. In Jamaica consecutive participants were selected on clinic days for non-communicable diseases. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were conducted by telephone.Results 576 participants were recruited (50% Jamaica; 68.5% female). Jamaica’s participants were younger (36% vs 23% <60 years) and had a lower proportion of persons with “more than high school” education (17.2% vs 30.3%, p=0.011). Colombia’s participants more commonly tested positive for COVID-19 (24.2% vs 6.3%, p<0.001), had a family member or close friend test positive for COVID-19 (54.5% vs, 21.6%; p<0.001), experienced loss of a family member or friend due to COVID-19 (21.5% vs 7.8%, p<0.001) and had vaccination against COVID-19 (90.6% vs 46.7%, p<0.001). Fear of COVID-19 (AOR 2.71, 95% CI 1.20-6.13) and residence in Colombia (AOR 5.88 (95% CI 2.38-14.56) were associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Disruption in health services affecting prescription of medication or access to doctors was low (<10%) for both countries.Conclusion Health services disruption was low but COVID-19 experiences such as fear of COVID-19 and vaccine acceptance differed significantly between Colombia and Jamaica. Addressing reasons for these differences are important for future pandemic responses."

A blood based diagnostic biomarker would therefore be helpful. Axl is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed by many cancers including GBM. Axl expression is regulated through enzymatic cleavage of its extracellular domain. The resulting fragment can be detected in serum as soluble Axl (sAxl). sAxl levels can distinguish patients with melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from healthy controls. This is a pilot study to determine if sAxl is a candidate biomarker for GBM. The sAxl levels in the serum of 40 healthy volunteers and 20 GBM patients were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pre- and post-operative sAxl levels were obtained. Volumetric MRI evaluation provided GBM tumor volume metrics. There was no significant difference in the sAxl levels of the volunteers (30.16±1.88 ng/ml) and GBM patients (30.74±1.96 ng/ml) p=0.27. The postoperative sAxl levels were significantly higher than preoperative levels (32.32±2.26 ng/ml vs 30.74±1.96 ng/ml, p=0.03). We found no correlation between tumor volume and sAxl levels. Axl expression was low or absent in 6 of 11 (55%) patient derived GBM cell lines. Given the wide range of Axl expression by GBM tumors, sAxl may not be a reliable indicator of GBM. However, given the small sample size in this study, a larger study may be considered."

It also assesses referral frequency and response time in order to understand palliative care utilization in an acute hospital setting.Methods A retrospective chart review and database analysis was performed to extract data on demographics, cancer diagnoses, and referral reasons for patients referred to the specialist palliative care service over three years. The study focuses on identifying patterns in the characteristics of the referred patient population.Results Analysis of 162 patients revealed a distribution across cancer subtypes: 62% ovarian, 22% endometrial, 12% cervical, and 4% vulvar. A notable finding was that the outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer were more likely to be discharged home with or without community care (61.8%) compared to those with endometrial cancer (41.0%). A rapid response to referrals was observed, with 70% reviewed within three days and 98% within a week. This highlights the service’s efficiency and the demographic and diagnostic profile of the patient served.Significance of Results This study gives insight into the demographic and diagnostic profiles of gynecological cancer patients referred for palliative care, alongside demonstrating rapid response to such referrals. Despite the rapid assessment times, the research importantly identifies differences in outcomes among different cancer subtypes, with a particular emphasis on the variance in discharge destinations. These findings reflect both patient preference and medical need, demonstrating the role of tailoring palliative care approaches to meet the individual needs and desires of this diverse patient population. Characterizing these patient profiles and outcomes serves as a crucial step in enhancing the effectiveness of palliative care strategies, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for patients facing gynecological cancer."

(2) What is the average symptom trajectory? (3) How much do responders differ from the average trend? (4) How quickly do PTSD symptoms improve or worsen?Methods Data include 81,298 observations from n = 12,822 responders, spanning from July 2002 to December 2022. Fourteen percent meet PTSD criteria. PTSD symptoms were measured using the PCL-17. Retest correlations were calculated to estimate stability, growth curve models to estimate individual trajectories, and Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate the rate of clinically significant change.Results Retest correlations were high overall (range =.49, .84), lower in PTSD cases (range =.21, .78), and decreased as a function of time between assessments. The best-fitting growth model represented trajectories continuously rather than multiple classes. Symptom burden peaked in 2011 and declined modestly by 2022 (Cohen’s d = -0.28 and -0.59 in all responders and PTSD cases, respectively). Median time before clinically significant improvement in responders with PTSD was 8.88 years (95% CI = 8.01, 9.79).Conclusions In the longest and largest study of PTSD symptoms tracked continuously since exposure, illness course was characterized to find that, while symptoms were highly stable in the short term, symptoms changed significantly over two decades. Most responders experienced clinical improvement after nine years, but 10% had poor course and should be the focus of public health efforts."

In Mozambique, the prevalence of this co-infection is 9.1%, calling for specific policies on prevention, diagnosis and adequate management in health facilities caring for HIV patients. This study aimed to review the existing policies and to assess the knowledge and practices of health professionals about HIV/HBV co-infection.Methods A document and literature review to describe the existing policies and guidelines on HIV/HBV co-infection in Mozambique was performed. Key informants were contacted to clarify or add information. Health Professionals who care for HIV-positive patients in four health centers in Maputo City, the capital of Mozambique, responded to a questionnaire on knowledge and practices about this co-infection. Qualitative analysis was done to identify main themes using content analysis. Descriptive statistics of socio-demographic, knowledge and practice variables was presented using the SPSS Program version 20 and bivariate analysis was applied to describe the association between variables.Results Twenty-one policy documents were found, and five key informants were interviewed. Fifty-two participants answered the questionnaire. Only one policy document explicitly referred to HIV/HBV co-infection treatment. Most Health Professionals (96%) were aware of HIV/HBV co-infection. Although the only existing policy is on the treatment, few (33%) referenced antiretroviral formulations containing Tenofovir and Lamivudine. Only 29% of Health Professionals reported screening HIV patients for HBV and 21% practiced HIV/HBV co-infection counselling. No statistically significant differences were found when relating the socio-demographic variables with knowledge and practices.Conclusion Policy documents relating to prevention, diagnosis and clinical management of HIV/HBV co-infection were rare or absent. Health Professionals had little knowledge about HIV/HBV co-infection. Defining adequate policies and training of Health Professionals may help increase awareness, increase counselling of patients for disease prevention, diagnosis and proper management of HIV/HBV co-infected patients."

We aimed to characterize the geographical transmission of the DENV in Bangladesh. From 1 Jan – 31 Dec 2023, we extracted and analyzed daily data on dengue cases and deaths from the national Management Information System (MIS). We performed a generalized linear mixed model to identify the associations between division-wise daily dengue counts and various geographical and meteorological covariates. The number of Dengue cases reported in 2023 was 1.3 times higher than the total number recorded in the past 23 years (321,179 vs. 244,246), with twice as many deaths than the total fatalities recorded in the past 23 years (1705 vs. 849). Of the 1705 deaths in 2023, 67.4% (n=1015) expired within one day after hospital admission. The divisions southern to Dhaka had a higher dengue incidence/1000 population (2.30 vs. 0.50, p<0,0.01), and higher mean annual temperatures (27.46 vs. 26.54 °C) than the northern divisions. The average daily temperature (IRR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.11-1.14), urban and rural population ratio of the divisions (IRR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03-1.04), showed a positive, and rainfall (IRR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-0.99) showed a negative association with dengue cases in each division. We observed a major geographical shift of Dengue cases from the capital city Dhaka to different districts of Bangladesh with a higher incidence of dengue in the southern division of Bangladesh, influenced by temperature and urbanization."

The infectious agent most commonly causing IM, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with the development of several immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases.Objective To investigate the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) following hospitalisation with severe IM.Methods Danish nationwide registries were used to identify severe IM patients and sex-, age- and municipality-matched non-IM hospitalised controls, from 1st January 1977 to 31st December 2022. We undertook Cox regression modelling to calculate the hazards (HR) and 95% CI of IBD diagnosis, including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Analyses were stratified by sex and age at IM hospitalisation.Results We identified 39,684 patients with severe IM who were sex-, age-, and municipality-matched to 396,840 non-IM hospitalised controls. Severe IM was significantly associated with the development of IBD (HR:1.35; 95% CI: 1.22-1.49) and this was seen particularly in CD (HR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.34-1.83) and to a lesser extent in UC (HR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.08-1.40). Sex at severe IM diagnosis was not found to be a significant modifier to the risk of IBD development with risk increased in both females (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.20-1.55) and males (HR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.17-1.54). Only those receiving a severe IM diagnosis at 10-16 years (HR: 1.42; 95% CI:1.22-1.64) or 17-29 years (HR: 1.34; 95% CI:1.15-1.56) were at increased risk of IBD development.Conclusion This study demonstrated an association between IM hospitalisation and later IBD development, indicating an association between severe EBV disease and IBD development. Further exploration of factors contributing to IBD susceptibility following EBV infection is warranted."

Here, we investigated the potential shared genetic basis of common epilepsies and general cognitive ability (COG).Methods We applied linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) regression, MiXeR and conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) to analyze different aspects of genetic overlap between COG and epilepsies. We used the largest available genome-wide association study data on COG (n = 269,867) and common epilepsies (n = 27,559 cases, 42,436 controls), including the broad phenotypes ‘all epilepsy’, focal epilepsies and genetic generalized epilepsies (GGE), and as well as specific subtypes. We functionally annotated the identified loci using a variety of biological resources and validated the results in independent samples.Results Using MiXeR, COG (11.2k variants) was estimated to be almost four times more polygenic than ‘all epilepsy’, GGE, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), and childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) (2.5k – 2.9k variants). The other epilepsy phenotypes were insufficiently powered for analysis. We show extensive genetic overlap between COG and epilepsies with significant negative genetic correlations (-0.23 to -0.04). COG was estimated to share 2.9k variants with both GGE and ‘all epilepsy’, and 2.3k variants with both JME and CAE. Using conjFDR, we identified 66 distinct loci shared between COG and epilepsies, including novel associations for GGE (27), ‘all epilepsy’ (5), JME (5) and CAE (5). The implicated genes were significantly expressed in multiple brain regions. The results were validated in independent samples (COG: p = 1.0 x 10-14; ‘all epilepsy’: p = 5.6 x 10-3).Significance Our study demonstrates a substantial genetic basis shared between epilepsies and COG and identifies novel overlapping genomic loci. Enhancing our understanding of the relationship between epilepsies and COG may lead to the development of novel comorbidity-targeted epilepsy treatments."

Use of this tool in people aged under 65 years with MLTC has not previously been investigated. This study investigated the feasibility of using the OPT in people with MLTC aged 45 years or above, in a multi-ethnic primary-care setting, to describe the health outcome priorities of people with MLTC by age, clusters of long-term conditions and demographic factors, and to investigate any differences in prioritisation in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods This was a multi-centre cross-sectional study using a questionnaire for online self-completion by people aged 45 years or above with MLTC in 19 primary care settings across the East Midlands, UK. Participants were asked to complete the OPT twice, first from their current perspective and second from their recollection of their priorities prior to COVID-19.Results The questionnaire was completed by 2,454 people with MLTC. The majority of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the OPT was easy to complete, relevant to their healthcare and will be useful in communicating priorities to their doctor. Summary scores for the whole cohort of participants showed Keeping Alive and Maintaining Independence receiving the highest scores. Statistically significant differences in prioritisation by age, clusters of long-term conditions and employment status were observed, with respondents aged over 65 most likely to prioritise Maintaining independence, and respondents aged under 65 most likely to prioritise Keeping alive. There were no differences before or after COVID-19, or by ethnicity.Conclusions The OPT is feasible and acceptable for use to elicit the health outcome priorities of people with MLTC across both middle-aged and older age groups and in a UK setting. Individual factors could influence the priorities of people with MLTC and must be considered by clinicians during consultations.HIGHLIGHTSSurvey data from 2,454 patients with MLTC showed that keeping alive and maintaining independence were the top first-choice priorities from the health outcome priorities tool (OPT).The health outcomes priorities differed by socio-demographics and clusters of long-term conditions.There were no differences in health outcomes priorities before and during COVID-19.OPT is easy and acceptable to implement in a health care setting in a broad patient group.Translation of the OPT into different languages is recommended to address any potential language barrier for people with MLTC completing the OPT"

This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on dengue transmission and generate insights to guide more targeted prevention measures. We aim to compare dengue transmission patterns and the exposure-response relationship of environmental variables and dengue incidence in the pre- and during-COVID-19 to identify variations and assess the impact of COVID-19 on dengue transmission. We initially visualized the overall trend of dengue transmission from 2012-2022, then conducted two quantitative analyses to compare dengue transmission pre-COVID-19 (2017-2019) and during-COVID-19 (2020-2022). These analyses included time series analysis to assess dengue seasonality, and a Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) to quantify the exposure-response relationship between environmental variables and dengue incidence. We observed that all subregions in Thailand exhibited remarkable synchrony with a similar annual trend except 2021. Cyclic and seasonal patterns of dengue remained consistent pre- and during-COVID-19. Monthly dengue incidence in three countries varied significantly. Singapore witnessed a notable surge during-COVID-19, particularly from May to August, with cases multiplying several times compared to pre-COVID-19, while seasonality of Malaysia weakened. Exposure-response relationships of dengue and environmental variables show varying degrees of change, notably in Northern Thailand, where the peak relative risk for the maximum temperature-dengue relationship rose from about 3 to 17, and the max RR of overall cumulative association 0-3 months of relative humidity increased from around 5 to 55. Our study is the first to compare dengue transmission patterns and their relationship with environmental variables before and during COVID-19, showing that COVID-19 has affected dengue transmission at both the national and regional level, and has altered the exposure-response relationship between dengue and the environment.Author Summary Dengue fever is a typical tropical disease transmitted via mosquito bites. COVID-19 lockdowns have altered human-mosquito contact patterns that impacted dengue transmission. Additionally, lockdowns caused short-term environmental changes that affected dengue vector breeding. In fact, during the COVID-19 period, the normal prevention and treatment of dengue in many dengue-endemic countries was negatively affected due to the sweep of COVID-19, such as strained allocation of medical resources and misreporting of cases. Therefore, this offers a unique chance to study the impact of COVID-19 on dengue transmission, guiding targeted and reasonable prevention measures. We used a series of analytical approaches including time series analysis, space-time scan statistics, and distributed lag non-linear model to compare the differences in dengue transmission patterns and its exposure-response relationships with four environmental variables (average monthly precipitation, average monthly relative humidity, monthly maximum temperature, and monthly minimum temperature) before and during COVID-19 in three Southeast Asian countries: Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand at the province scale. We found that the dengue transmission pattern and its relationship with the environmental variables changed differently. For instance, seasonality and infections heightened in Singapore during COVID-19 and peak relative risk between max temperature and dengue has rose significantly in Northern Thailand."

These algorithms may reflect biases that magnify disparities in clinical care, and there is a growing need for understanding how algorithmic biases can be mitigated in pursuit of algorithmic fairness. Individual fairness in algorithms constrains algorithms to the notion that “similar individuals should be treated similarly.” We conducted a scoping review on algorithmic individual fairness to understand the current state of research in the metrics and methods developed to achieve individual fairness and its applications in healthcare.Methods We searched three databases, PubMed, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore, for algorithmic individual fairness metrics, algorithmic bias mitigation, and healthcare applications. Our search was restricted to articles published between January 2013 and September 2023. We identified 1,886 articles through database searches and manually identified one article from which we included 30 articles in the review. Data from the selected articles were extracted, and the findings were synthesized.Results Based on the 30 articles in the review, we identified several themes, including philosophical underpinnings of fairness, individual fairness metrics, mitigation methods for achieving individual fairness, implications of achieving individual fairness on group fairness and vice versa, fairness metrics that combined individual fairness and group fairness, software for measuring and optimizing individual fairness, and applications of individual fairness in healthcare.Conclusion While there has been significant work on algorithmic individual fairness in recent years, the definition, use, and study of individual fairness remain in their infancy, especially in healthcare. Future research is needed to apply and evaluate individual fairness in healthcare comprehensively."

Among the various species of Babesia that infect humans, B. duncani has been found to cause severe and life-threatening infections. Detection of active B. duncani infection is critical for accurate diagnosis and effective management of the disease. While molecular assays for the detection of B. duncani infection in blood are available, a reliable strategy to detect biomarkers of active infection has not yet been developed. Here, we report the development of the first B. duncani antigen capture assays that rely on the detection of two B. duncani-exported immunodominant antigens, BdV234 and BdV38. The assays were validated using blood samples from cultured parasites in human erythrocytes and B. duncani-infected laboratory mice at different parasitemia levels and following therapy. The assays display high specificity with no cross-reactivity with B. microti, B. divergens, Babesia MO1, or P. falciparum. The assay also demonstrates high sensitivity, detecting as low as 115 infected erythrocytes/µl of blood. Screening of 1,731 blood samples from diverse biorepositories, including previously identified Lyme and/or B. microti positive human samples and new specimens from field mice, showed no evidence of B. duncani infection in these samples. The assays could be useful in diverse diagnostic scenarios, including point-of-care testing for early B. duncani infection detection in patients, field tests for screening reservoir hosts, and high-throughput screening such as blood collected for transfusion.Short summary We developed two ELISA-based assays, BdACA38 and BdACA234, for detecting B. duncani, a potentially fatal tick-borne parasite causing human babesiosis. The assays target two immunodominant antigens, BdV234 and BdV38, demonstrating high specificity (no cross-reactivity with other Babesia species or Plasmodium falciparum) and sensitivity (detecting as low as 115 infected erythrocytes/µl). The assays were validated using in vitro-cultured parasites and infected mice. Screening diverse blood samples showed no evidence of B. duncani active infection among 1,731 human and field mice blood samples collected from the north-eastern, midwestern, and western US. These assays offer potential in diverse diagnostic scenarios, including early patient detection, reservoir animal screening, and transfusion-transmitted babesiosis prevention."

This study investigated the heterogeneity of these treatments’ effects based on individual pathogen and EED biomarker status with respect to child linear growth.Methods We applied cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimation and super learner ensemble machine learning to assess the conditional treatment effects in subgroups defined by biomarker and pathogen status. We analyzed treatment (N+WSH, WSH, N, or control) randomly assigned in-utero, child pathogen and EED data at 14 months of age, and child LAZ at 28 months of age. We estimated the difference in mean child length for age Z-score (LAZ) under the treatment rule and the difference in stratified treatment effect (treatment effect difference) comparing children with high versus low pathogen/biomarker status while controlling for baseline covariates.Results We analyzed data from 1,522 children, who had median LAZ of -1.56. We found that myeloperoxidase (N+WSH treatment effect difference 0.0007 LAZ, WSH treatment effect difference 0.1032 LAZ, N treatment effect difference 0.0037 LAZ) and Campylobacter infection (N+WSH treatment effect difference 0.0011 LAZ, WSH difference 0.0119 LAZ, N difference 0.0255 LAZ) were associated with greater effect of all interventions on growth. In other words, children with high myeloperoxidase or Campylobacter infection experienced a greater impact of the interventions on growth. We found that a treatment rule that assigned the N+WSH (LAZ difference 0.23, 95% CI (0.05, 0.41)) and WSH (LAZ difference 0.17, 95% CI (0.04, 0.30)) interventions based on EED biomarkers and pathogens increased predicted child growth compared to the randomly allocated intervention.Conclusions These findings indicate that EED biomarker and pathogen status, particularly Campylobacter and myeloperoxidase (a measure of gut inflammation), may be related to impact of N+WSH, WSH, and N interventions on child linear growth."

Resonant breathing exercises require less exertion and can potentially improve autonomic function. The objective of this work was to report on the impact of a resonant breathing program on self-reported symptoms and wellbeing in people with Long COVID.Methods A retrospective analysis of de-identified data was completed in a convenience sample of people with Long Covid, who participated in the Meo Health (formerly known as Stasis HP) resonant breathing program. Participants completed baseline and follow up surveys.Results Data were available for 99 participants. Most measures of symptoms and wellbeing improved at follow up, with the largest differences per participant seen in sense of wellness (47.3%, p<0.0001), ability to focus (57.5%, p<0.0001), ability to breathe (47.5%, p<0.0001), ability to control stress (61.8%, p<0.0001) and sleep quality (34.9%, p=0.0002). Most (92%) participants reported improvement at follow up on the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale.Conclusion Self-reported symptoms and wellbeing improved in people with Long COVID completing resonant breathing. Resonant breathing can be considered as an option within the broader treatment plan of people with Long COVID."

The role of other HAdV species in diarrhoeal disease remains unclear and data of their prevalence is limited. We describe HAdV species and types in hospitalised children with diarrhoea in coastal Kenya.Methods 329 stool samples collected between June 2022 and August 2023 from children aged <13-years were screened for HAdV using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Positive HAdV cases were genotyped by adenovirus primers from the RespiCoV panel by amplification, next generation sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis.Results 65 samples (20%) tested HadV positive from which five HAdV species were identified. Other than HAdV F, other species included A, B, C and D; these were detected as either mono-detections or coinfections. Six HAdV F identified by NGS had been missed by our q PCR typing method. This appeared to be as a result of a 133-nucleotide deletion in the long fiber protein which abrogated a primer and probe binding site. Based on VESIKARI scores grading of diarrheal disease severity, 93% of the HAdV cases presented with severe disease. One child with an HAdV F infection died.Conclusion Our study shows the enormous diversity and clinical characteristics of HAdV species in children with diarrhoea in coastal Kenya. These data offers an opportunity to improve current diagnostic assays, increase knowledge of HAdV in Africa for control of outbreaks in the future."

Prioritized variants were classified for pathogenicity and evaluated for genotype/phenotype correlations.Results Analyses elucidated phenotypic subgroups, identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant(s) in 43/467 probands (9.2%), and prioritized variants of uncertain significance in 70/467 additional probands (15.0%). These included known and novel variants in established oCCDD genes, genes associated with syndromes that sometimes include oCCDDs (e.g., MYH10, KIF21B, TGFBR2, TUBB6), genes that fit the syndromic component of the phenotype but had no prior oCCDD association (e.g., CDK13, TGFB2), genes with no reported association with oCCDDs or the syndromic phenotypes (e.g., TUBA4A, KIF5C, CTNNA1, KLB, FGF21), and genes associated with oCCDD phenocopies that had resulted in misdiagnoses.Conclusion This study suggests that unsolved oCCDDs are clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders often overlapping other Mendelian conditions and nominates many candidates for future replication and functional studies."

This study aims to explore the association between BMI and periarticular soft tissue on readmission complications in patients with previous joint replacement through the study of clinical and imaging data.Methods This retrospective study summarized 625 patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty. Imaging measurement data included several measurable soft tissue values and ratios on the anteroposterior. The association between BMI and imaging soft tissue measurement data with complications leading to readmission during follow-up was explored.Results Analyzing 761 preoperative imaging measurements and postoperative follow-up data, a significant correlation (P<0.05) emerged between postoperative readmission complications and measured soft tissue thickness around the joint. A 1:4 paired test affirmed the independent predictive power (P<0.1) of select soft tissue data for readmission complications.Conclusion BMI proved insufficient in evaluating obesity-related complications post total knee arthroplasty. Preoperative imaging soft tissue data exhibited superior predictive capability for anticipating readmission complications after arthroplasty.Trial registration number: S2021-094-01Trial registration dates: 25/03/2021 Retrospectively registered"

In light of inadequate survey tools for use in population studies, we developed a novel questionnaire to retrospectively assess the main kidney diseases, integrating it within the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) study conducted between 2011 and 2018 in the Alpine district of Val Venosta/Vinschgau (Italy).Methods The questionnaire covers general kidney diseases, reduced kidney function, and renal surgeries. It was applied to the cross-sectional assessment of self-reported kidney health among 11,684 adults, along with measures of fasting estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). By factor analysis we contextualized the questionnaire content with respect to biochemical measurements. CKD was defined according to KDIGO guidelines, self-reported diagnosis, and their combination. Prevalence estimates were calibrated to the general target population via relative sampling weights.Results In this population sample (median age=45 years; median eGFR=98.4 mL/min/1.73 m2; median UACR=5.7 mg/g), 8.3% of participants reported at least one kidney disease. Population-representative prevalence of glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, and congenital kidney diseases was 1.0%, 3.0%, and 0.2%, respectively, with corresponding odds ratio for females versus males of 1.4 (95% confidence interval: 1.0, 2.0), 8.7 (6.2, 12.3), and 0.7 (0.3, 1.6), respectively. CKD prevalence was 8.6% when based on KDIGO criteria and 0.7% when self-reported, indicating that 95.3% of affected individuals were unaware of having CKD, with a similar figure of 92.9% in those reporting diabetes or hypertension. Overall, 15.8% of the population was affected by a kidney disease of any kind.Conclusion In this Alpine population, CKD prevalence aligned with Western European estimates. Kidney health questionnaire implementation in population studies is feasible and valuable to assess CKD awareness, which we found to be dramatically low."

These properties are closely associated with the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.Objective The present systematic review aimed to determine the association between Mediterranean Diet and COVID-19, COVID-19 symptoms, and COVID-19 severity.Methods The protocol for this systematic review was registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with identification number CRD42023451794. The literature search was conducted through Pubmed, Proquest, and Google Scholar on August 2023. The inclusion criteria were studies with a population of human subjects, reported the association between Mediterranean diet adherence with risk of COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 symptoms, or COVID-19 severity, and full text must be available in English. The exclusion criteria were reviews, editorials, letters, replies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, studies on animals, and duplicates. Risk of bias in included studies was assessed using Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Data was synthesized narratively. Each study was compared and a structured summary was developed.Results After selection process, 6 articles were included, with a sample size of 55,489 patients. All studies were observational studies and assessed Mediterranean diet adherence using food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), with scoring system varied between each study. Four studies found a significant correlation between increased adherence to Mediterranean Diet and reduced COVID-19 risk, while one study indicated non-significant association. One study reported a significant association between higher adherence to Mediterranean Diet and COVID-19 symptoms, but three studies reported non-significant association. One study found that individuals with higher adherence to Mediterranean Diet had reduced likelihood of developing severe COVID-19, however, two studies yielded inconclusive findings.Limitations All studies used self-administrated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), which were prone to biased responses, such as recall and estimation bias.Discussion Lower trends of odds ratios (ORs) were consistently observed in higher Mediterranean diet adherence. In every outcome of the included studies, ORs ranged between 0.06-0.992, however, differing levels of significance were reported in each outcome.Conclusion Overall analyses suggest that high adherence to Mediterranean Diet is a protective factor against COVID-19, with unclear benefits against COVID-19 symptoms and severity.Primary Funding Source The author(s) received no specific funding for this work."

The theory behind is to gradually remove cytotoxic cryoprotectants and rehydrate the embryo to minimize the damages during the vitrified-thaw processes. The whole process is time consuming and laborious routine in the IVF laboratory. Here, we showed that direct thawing a vitrified blastocyst in a regular human embryo culture medium without any cryoprotectant support 100% thawing survival rate regardless to blastocysts’ grading. Surprisingly, better implantation outcome was observed in our small cohort trial although not reached a significant different. There are more than million frozen embryo transfers around the world each year; a faster, safer and cheaper method can save significant amount of money for patients undergoing IVF treatment worldwide.Methods A two-phase trial were conducted: Technical phase and clinical phase. In the Technical phase, 4 commercially available one-step media and PBS solution were used for thawing procedure on donated human vitrified blastocysts. The survival rate was determined by re-expansion under time-lapse imaging. All of the one-step media at a specific range of osmolality solution between 270±10 (mOsm/KG) with human serum albumin were tested. PBS with human serum albumin at the same osmolality were used as control. We then investigated the technical comparability on routine blastocyst manipulation, we tested repeated direct thawing and repeated biopsies on the tested embryos in order to show the direct thawing method can be applied to any possible routine IVF procedures. In the clinical phase, 20 patients were recruited for the direct thawing compared to the conventional thawing of 96 patients during the same study period. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to estimate the different between two procedures.Results In the technical phase, we showed that all of the one-step media supported human vitrified blastocyst thawing with 100% survival rate (N=52), even in the PBS control (N=11). And the revived blastocysts are capable to re-expend comparable to conventional vitrified-thawing method. We also demonstrate this single-direct rehydrated and thawed blastocyst in embryo culture medium survived from direct thawing, trophectoderm biopsy, second vitrified, second direct thawing with the second biopsy indicated that this new method is comparable to conventional IVF procedures (N=13). Pilot clinical study showed a higher implantation rate was also obtained from this direct thawing method compared to conventional warming (61.9% VS 37.2%) and leading to healthy live birth (45% VS 36.8%). Our cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the medium direct thawing could save 42% consumable cost for patients and 90% of labor time.Conclusions We conclude that a regular embryo culture medium is comparable to the traditional thawing method that potentially can save billions of dollars and thousands of labour hours each year in IVF setting worldwide. We proved gradual cryoprotectant removal and gradual rehydration are not necessary for human blastocyst thawing survivals. Using a regular embryo culture medium for thawing blastocysts supported all clinical outcome equivalent to conventional thawing procedure. Our data also showed that the method can cut down the cost and labour time in all IVF clinics worldwide.Limitation Only single Vitrification kit and embryo carrier were used in this study. The mechanism on how the human blastocysts survived from one-step thawing remain unknown and the actual clinical power at larger scale is yet to be resolved."

However, there is limited knowledge regarding Ab epidemiology and population structure in the U.S. Deep South, and few studies compare contemporary CR and carbapenem-susceptible (Cs) Ab, despite prevalence of the latter. We performed a 12-year time series analysis of Ab cases in a large hospital in Birmingham, AL, and 89 isolates from an ongoing surveillance project started in November 2021 were analyzed by whole genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST). Cumulative CR rate among 2462 cases since 2011 was 19.4%, with increased rates during winter months resulting from seasonal changes in CsAb incidence. Sequenced CRAb belonged to clonal complex (CC) 1, CC108, CC250, CC2, and CC499. Most CRAb CCs were comprised of isolates that clustered apart from U.S. counterparts in phylogenetic analysis, despite being identified in unrelated cases occurring ≥3 months apart. In contrast, 38/47 (81%) CsAb isolates each belonged to a distinct CC. CRAb isolates displayed lineage-distinct AST features, including unique carbapenem resistance genetic determinants and presumptive heteroresistance behaviors unique to CC108 and CC499 isolates. This first comprehensive analysis of Ab cases in the U.S. Deep South revealed epidemiological trends consistent with those in other regions and an unusually high degree of phylogenetic diversity among regional CRAb isolates. We also describe emergent U.S. CRAb lineages whose unconventional antimicrobial resistance features must be integrated into ongoing diagnostic, treatment, and surveillance efforts."

Unfortunately, some published RCTs contain false data, and some appear to have been entirely fabricated. Systematic reviews are performed to identify and synthesise all RCTs which have been conducted on a given topic. This means that any of these ‘problematic studies’ are likely to be included, but there are no agreed methods for identifying them. The INSPECT-SR project is developing a tool to identify problematic RCTs in systematic reviews of healthcare-related interventions. The tool will guide the user through a series of ‘checks’ to determine a study’s authenticity. The first objective in the development process is to assemble a comprehensive list of checks to consider for inclusion.Methods We assembled an initial list of checks for assessing the authenticity of research studies, with no restriction to RCTs, and categorised these into five domains: Inspecting results in the paper; Inspecting the research team; Inspecting conduct, governance, and transparency; Inspecting text and publication details; Inspecting the individual participant data. We implemented this list as an online survey, and invited people with expertise and experience of assessing potentially problematic studies to participate through professional networks and online forums. Participants were invited to provide feedback on the checks on the list, and were asked to describe any additional checks they knew of, which were not featured in the list.Results Extensive feedback on an initial list of 102 checks was provided by 71 participants based in 16 countries across five continents. Fourteen new checks were proposed across the five domains, and suggestions were made to reword checks on the initial list. An updated list of checks was constructed, comprising 116 checks. Many participants expressed a lack of familiarity with statistical checks, and emphasized the importance of feasibility of the tool.Conclusions A comprehensive list of trustworthiness checks has been produced. The checks will be evaluated to determine which should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool."

However, in resource-limited settings, these infants are commonly discharged early which further exposes them to mortality. Previous studies on morbidity and mortality among low birth weight infants after early discharge mainly focused on very low birth weight infants, and none described post-discharge neonatal mortality. This study aimed to determine the proportion and predictors of mortality among low birth weight neonates discharged from the Special Care Baby Unit at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda.Methods This was a prospective cohort study of 220 low birth weight neonates discharged from the Special Care Baby Unit at Mulago National Referral Hospital. These were followed up to 28 completed days of life, or death, whichever occurred first. Proportions were used to express mortality. To determine the predictors of mortality, Cox hazards regression was performed.Results Of the 220 enrolled participants, 216 (98.1%) completed the follow-up. The mean gestational age of study participants was 34 ±3 weeks. The median weight at discharge was 1,650g (IQR: 1,315g -1,922g) and 46.1% were small for gestational age. During follow-up, 14/216 (6.5%) of neonates died. Mortality was highest (7/34, 20.6%) among neonates with discharge weights less than 1,200g. The causes of death included presumed neonatal sepsis (10/14, 71.4%), suspected aspiration pneumonia (2/14, 14.3%), and suspected cot death (2/14, 14.3%). The median time to death after discharge was 11 days (range 3-16 days). The predictors of mortality were a discharge weight of less than 1,200g (adj HR: 23.47, p <0.001), a 5-minute Apgar score of less than 7 (adj HR: 4.25, p = 0.016), and a diagnosis of neonatal sepsis during admission (adj HR: 7.93, p = 0.009).Conclusion Post-discharge mortality among low birth weight neonates at Mulago National Referral Hospital is high. A discharge weight of less than 1,200g may be considered unsafe among neonates. Caregiver education about neonatal danger signs, and measures to prevent sepsis, aspiration, and cot death should be emphasized before discharge and during follow-up visits."

There have been more than half a billion human infections and more than 6 million deaths globally attributable to COVID-19. Although treatments and vaccines to protect against COVID-19 are now available, people continue being hospitalized and dying due to COVID-19 infections. Real-time surveillance of population-level infections, hospitalizations, and deaths has helped public health officials better allocate healthcare resources and deploy mitigation strategies. However, producing reliable, real-time, short-term disease activity forecasts (one or two weeks into the future) remains a practical challenge. The recent emergence of robust time-series forecasting methodologies based on deep learning approaches has led to clear improvements in multiple research fields. We propose a recurrent neural network model named Fine-Grained Infection Forecast Network (FIGI-Net), which utilizes a stacked bidirectional LSTM structure designed to leverage fine-grained county-level data, to produce daily forecasts of COVID-19 infection trends up to two weeks in advance. We show that FIGI-Net improves existing COVID-19 forecasting approaches and delivers accurate county-level COVID-19 disease estimates. Specifically, FIGI-Net is capable of anticipating upcoming sudden changes in disease trends such as the onset of a new outbreak or the peak of an ongoing outbreak, a skill that multiple existing state-of-the-art models fail to achieve. This improved performance is observed across locations and periods. Our enhanced forecasting methodologies may help protect human populations against future disease outbreaks."

Validation of a Gamified Rhythmic Training in Children with ADHD,"AbstractNeurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD can affect rhythm perception and production, impacting the performance in attention and sensorimotor tasks. Improving rhythmic abilities through targeted training might compensate for these cognitive functions. We introduce a novel protocol for training rhythmic skills via a tablet-based serious game called Rhythm Workers (RW). This proof-of-concept study tested the feasibility of using RW in children with ADHD. We administered an at-home longitudinal protocol across Canada. A total of 27 children (7-13 years) were randomly assigned to either a finger-tapping rhythmic game (RW) or a control game with comparable auditory-motor demands but without beat-synchronization (active control condition). Participants played the game for 300 minutes over two weeks. We collected data (self-reported and logged onto the device) on game compliance and acceptance. Further, we measured rhythmic abilities using the Battery for the Assessment of Auditory Sensorimotor and Timing Abilities (BAASTA). The current findings show that both games were equally played in duration, rated similarly for overall enjoyment, and relied on similar motor activity (finger taps). The children who played RW showed improved general rhythmic abilities compared to controls; these improvements were also positively related to the playing duration. We also present preliminary evidence that executive functioning improved in those who played RW but not controls. These findings indicate that both games are well-matched. RW demonstrates efficacy in enhancing sensorimotor skills in children with ADHD, potentially benefiting executive functioning. A future RCT with extended training and sample size could further validate these skill transfer effects."

The QuickMIC system provides rapid AST using a microfluidic linear gradient. Here we evaluate the performance of QuickMIC at four different laboratories with regards to speed, precision, accuracy, and reproducibility in comparison to broth microdilution (BMD).Methods Spiked blood cultures (n=411) and clinical blood cultures (n=148) were tested with the QuickMIC Gram negative (GN) panel and compared with BMD for the 12 on-panel antibiotics, and 10 defined strains were run at each site to measure reproducibility. Logistic and linear regression analysis was applied to explore factors affecting assay performance.Results The overall essential agreement (EA) and categorical agreement (CA) between QuickMIC and BMD were 95.6% and 96.0%, respectively. Very major error (VME), Major error (ME) and minor error (mE) rates were 1.0, 0.6 and 2.4%, respectively. Inter-laboratory reproducibility between the sites was high at 98.9% using the acceptable standard of ±1 log2 unit. The mean in-instrument analysis time overall was 3h 13 min (SD: 29 min). Regression analysis indicated that QuickMIC is robust with regards to initial inoculate and delay time after blood culture positivity.Conclusions We conclude that QuickMIC can be used to rapidly measure MIC directly from blood cultures in clinical settings, with a high reproducibility, precision, and accuracy. The microfluidics-generated linear gradient ensures high repeatability and reproducibility between laboratories, thus allowing a high level of trust in MIC values from single testing, at the cost of reduced measurement range compared to BMD."

Parameters such as slow wave amplitude (SWa), high-frequency power (HFp) suppression, and the Perturbational Complexity Index-state transition (PCIst) were analyzed to quantify sleep-like cortical dynamics and their network-level consequences.Results Results demonstrated a significant clinical improvement (NIHSS score: 7.16±0.73 at t0, 4.33±0.74 at t1; W=78, P<0.001). Perilesional SWa and HFp suppression decreased significantly at t1 compared to t0 (T(11)=3.05, P=0.01 and T(11)=-3.39, P<0.01, respectively), along with recovery of PCIst values (T(11)=-2.35, P=0.04). Importantly, both the dissipation of sleep-like perilesional cortical dynamics and the recovery of network-level interactions correlated with patients’ clinical improvement (Spearman ρ=0.62, P=0.03; ρ=-0.68, P=0.01, respectively).Conclusion These findings underscore the potential of TMS-EEG as an objective measure of neurological evolution and suggest targeting sleep-like cortical dynamics as a viable strategy for post-stroke neuromodulation and rehabilitation."

We present COMPRER, a novel multi-modal, multi-objective pretraining framework which enhances medical-image representation, diagnostic inferences, and prognosis of diseases. COMPRER employs a multi-objective training framework, where each objective introduces distinct knowledge to the model. This includes a multi-modal loss that consolidates information across different imaging modalities; A temporal loss that imparts the ability to discern patterns over time; Medical-measure prediction adds appropriate medical insights; Lastly, reconstruction loss ensures the integrity of image structure within the latent space. Despite the concern that multiple objectives could weaken task performance, our findings show that this combination actually boosts outcomes on certain tasks. Here, we apply this framework to both fundus images and carotid ultrasound, and validate our downstream tasks capabilities by predicting both current and future cardiovascular conditions. COMPRER achieved higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores in evaluating medical conditions compared to existing models on held-out data. On the Out-of-distribution (OOD) UK-Biobank dataset COMPRER maintains favorable performance over well-established models with more parameters, even though these models were trained on 75× more data than COMPRER. In addition, to better assess our model’s performance in contrastive learning, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, providing deeper understanding of the effectiveness of the latent space pairing."

Our study aimed to explore the unique characteristics and underlying genetic and epigenetic features of the microsatellite stable (MSS) population within colorectal cancer. Using 325 samples, we compared MSS with other microsatellite statuses on more than 50 clinical indicators. A significantly different overall gene mutation rate was observed in the MSS group compared to the other groups, especially in P53 mutations. No notable changes were found in epigenetics. The results suggest that MSS colorectal cancer cases are more likely to have gene mutations than other subgroups. We also found that the N stage was lower in the MSI-H group. These findings provide crucial insights that can guide future drug development and treatment plans for the MSS population."

Systematic review identified thirty-eight studies that suffered from one particular and serious form of bias called miscategorisation bias, whereby study participants who have been vaccinated are categorised as unvaccinated up to and until some arbitrarily defined time after vaccination occurred. Simulation demonstrates that this miscategorisation bias artificially boosts vaccine efficacy and infection rates even when a vaccine has zero or negative efficacy. Furthermore, simulation demonstrates that repeated boosters, given every few months, are needed to maintain this misleading impression of efficacy. Given this, any claims of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy based on these studies are likely to be a statistical illusion."

This review sought to determine the prevalence, bacteriological and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacteria implicated in BSI in Cameroon.Methods PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify relevant articles, which were screened according to the PRISMA guidelines. The data were analysed using comprehensive meta-analysis software. The I2 was used to evaluate heterogeneity between studies, Begg’s and Egger’s regression tests were used to evaluate publication bias, and random effects analysis was used to calculate the pooled prevalence.Results A total of 4223 blood cultures were obtained from the 10 included studies. The overall pooled prevalence of bacterial BSI was 26.31% (95% CI= 17.01%–38.35%). Escherichia coli (23.09%; 95% CI= 9.21%–47.05%), Klebsiella spp. (22.95%; 95% CI= 13.09%–37.07%), and Staphylococcus aureus (16.09%; 95% CI= 8.11%–29.43%) were the most common bacteria species. E. coli and Klebsiella spp. displayed the highest resistance to amoxicillin (82.65%; 95% CI= 63.25%–92.95% vs 86.42%; 95% CI= 55.90%–96.97%), amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (71.74%; 43.96–89.15% vs 73.06%; 95% CI= 38.70%–92.09%) and cotrimoxazole (76.22%; 95% CI= 51.33%–90.79% vs 65.81%; 95% CI= 45.08–81.86%). However, meropenem (26.73%; 95% CI= 20.76%–33.68%) and fosfomycin (14.85%; 95% CI= 9.07%–23.37%) were the least resistant in E. coli and Klebsiella spp., respectively. Staphylococcus aureus strains exhibited highest resistance to penicillin (84.37%; 95% CI= 68.13%–93.16%), erythromycin (44.80%; 95% CI= 33.37%–56.79%) and oxacillin (37.35%; 95% CI= 8.76%–78.74%) and lowest resistance to rifampicin (2.94%; 95% CI= 0.59%–13.39%), fusidic acid (6.73%; 95% CI= 2.55%–16.62%) and vancomycin (13.18%; 95% CI= 2.26%–49.86%).Conclusion This study reports a high prevalence of bacterial BSIs in Cameroon and the high resistance of these bacteria to common antibiotics. There is a pressing need to conduct BSI surveillance studies in all regions of Cameroon to generate data for evidence-based measures regarding BSI prevention and management.Prospero registration number CRD42023482760"

A prothrombotic state may contribute to pathogenesis of SLE-PAH. Microvesicles (MVs) are known to be associated with thrombosis. Here, we investigated circulating MVs and their associations with SLE-PAH. Eighteen SLE-PAH patients, 36 SLE-non-PAH patients, and 36 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. Flow cytometry was used to analyze circulating MVs from leukocytes (LMVs), red blood cells (RMVs), platelets (PMVs), endothelial cells (EMVs), and Annexin V+ MVs with phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure. Plasma levels of all MV subgroups were elevated in SLE patients with or without PAH compared to HCs. Furthermore, plasma Annexin V+ MVs, LMVs, PMVs, RMVs, EMVs, and Annexin V+ RMVs were significantly elevated in SLE-PAH patients compared to SLE-non-PAH patients. Additionally, PAH patients with moderate/high SLE showed a significant increase in LMVs, PMVs, RMVs, Annexin V+ MVs, and Annexin V+ RMVs compared to SLE-non-PAH patients. However, PAH patients with inactive/mild SLE only exhibited elevations in Annexin V+ MVs, RMVs, and Annexin V+ RMVs. In the SLE-PAH patients, EMVs were positively correlated with pulmonary arterial systolic pressure, while PMVs and EMVs were positively correlated with right ventricular diameter. Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that Annexin V+ MVs, LMVs, PMVs, RMVs, EMVs and Annexin V+ RMVs can predict the presence of PAH in SLE patients. Importantly, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that circulating levels of LMVs or RMVs, anti-nRNP antibody, and serositis were independent risk factors for PAH in SLE patients. Finally, our findings reveal that specific subgroups of circulating MVs contribute to the hypercoagulation state and the severity of SLE-PAH. Higher plasma levels of LMVs or RMVs may serve as biomarkers for SLE-PAH."

This study examined the association of intensity-specific PA daily duration with all-cause (ACM) and CVD mortality varied among cadence-based and ML methods in 68,561 UK Biobank participants.Methods The two-stage-ML method categorized activity type and then intensity. The one-level-cadence method (1LC) derived intensity duration using all detected steps and cadence thresholds of ≥100 steps/min (moderate intensity) and ≥130 steps/min (vigorous intensity). The two-level-cadence method (2LC) detected ambulatory activities and then steps with the same cadence thresholds.Results The 2LC exhibited the most pronounced association at the lower end of the duration, e.g., the 2LC showed the smallest minimum moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) duration (amount associated with 50% of optimal risk reduction) (2LC vs 1LC vs ML, 2.8 minutes/day [95% CI: 2.6, 2.8] vs 11.1 [10.8, 11.4] vs 14.9 [14.6, 15.2]) while exhibiting similar corresponding ACM hazard ratio (HR) among methods (HR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.78, 0.88] vs 0.80 [0.76, 0.85] vs 0.82 [0.76, 0.87]). The ML elicited the greatest mortality risk reduction, e.g., for VPA-ACM association, 2LC vs 1LC vs ML: median, 2.0 minutes/day [95% CI: 2.0, 2.0] vs 6.9 [6.9, 7.0] vs 3.2 [3.2, 3.2]; HR, 0.69 [0.61, 0.79] vs 0.68 [0.60, 0.77] vs 0.53 [0.44, 0.64]. After standardizing duration, the ML exhibited the most pronounced associations, e.g., for MPA-CVD mortality, 2LC vs 1LC vs ML, standardized minimum-duration: -0.77 vs - 0.85 vs -0.94; HR 0.82 [0.72, 0.92] vs 0.79 [0.69, 0.90] vs 0.77 [0.69, 0.85].Conclusion The 2LC exhibited the most pronounced association with mortality at the lower end of the duration. The ML method provided the most pronounced association with mortality after standardizing the durations."

Evidence shows that some individuals experience pain that fluctuates in intensity following a circadian (24-hour) rhythm. Endogenous molecular rhythms regulate the function of most physiological processes, neuroimmunology functions that govern pain mechanisms. Addressing chronic pain rhythmicity on a molecular and biopsychosocial level can advance understanding of the disease and identify new treatment/management strategies. Our CircaHealth CircaPain study uses an online survey combined with ecological momentary assessments and bio-sample collection to investigate the circadian control of chronic pain and identify potential biomarkers. Our primary objective is to understand inter-individual variability in pain rhythmicity, by collecting biopsychosocial measures. The secondary objective accounts for seasonal variability and the effect of latitude on rhythmicity.Methods and analysis Following completion of a baseline questionnaire, participants complete a series of electronic symptom-tracking diaries to rate their pain intensity, negative affect, and fatigue on a 0-10 scale at 8:00, 14:00, and 20:00 daily over 10 days. These measures are repeated at 6- and 12-months post-enrolment to account for potential seasonal changes. Infrastructure is being developed to facilitate the collection of blood samples from subgroups of participants 2 times per day over 24-48 hours to identify rhythmic expression of circulating genes and/or proteins.Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval for this study was obtained by the Queen’s University Health Sciences and Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board. Findings will be published in a relevant scientific journal and disseminated at national and international scientific meetings and online webinars. We maintain a website to post updated resources and engage with the community. We employ knowledge mobilization in the form of direct data sharing with participants. This study is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (grant PJT-497592) and the CIHR Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) Chronic Pain Network (CPN) (grant SCA-145102).Ethical approval date: 08 March 2024Estimated start of the study: April 2024Strengths and limitations of this studyData will be collected using self-report questionnaires only, which may lead to random or systematic misreporting.The online nature of the study might affect the diversity in our sample (e.g., the representation of rural and/or underprivileged communities).Physical distance from research laboratories with specialized equipment for analyses and biobanking storage might affect accessibility, however, this can be overcome by using mailable dried blood spot collection kits as described.Questionnaires used in our study have previously been validated in the chronic pain population and used in several languages.Uncovering distinct pain rhythmicity patterns and health outcomes associated with rhythmicity may help develop new treatments for different chronic pain conditions tailored to individual circadian rhythms."

However, their quantification is limited by the lack of unified definitions and assessment tools. The aim of this systematic review is to map all psychometric instruments used to measure emotions associated with the climate crisis, evaluate their psychometric characteristics, and identify any existing gaps.Methods The protocol was registered on PROSPERO. Data were reported following the COSMIN Risk of Bias of PROM and PRISMA checklists. Original articles describing the psychometric properties and/or validation of self-report measures designed to assess eco-anxiety and other climate change-related emotions in the general population were within the scope of this review. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were the search engines used.Findings A total of 10 different psychometric scales measuring various eco-emotions were identified. Four focused on anxiety, while the remaining six focused on combinations of other negative emotions. The definitions of eco-emotions were not consistent across papers. Most of the instruments were developed in the Global North. Six of the instruments were multidimensional. All but one scale included at least one item indicating behavioural, cognitive, or physical aspects of emotions toward climate crises. The most recurrent emotion was worry, followed by anxiety, fear, and sadness. Including ten scale development studies, a total of 22 studies reporting instrument validation were reviewed. Two of the instruments have been validated in other populations.Interpretation To what extent the emotions covered by the instruments may overlap in relation to climate change is, to date, not clear. This is due to the lack of consistent definitions of climate-related emotions. Moreover, the mention of emotions was derived by a top-down approach, in all included studies. No positive emotions, such as hopefulness, humor, anticipated pride, gratitude, optimism, or feeling strong to do something though own contributions, have been detected."

We aimed to evaluate the validity of this approach.Study design and setting Data were analyzed from living and deceased member lists from Mainland China, UK and Greece academies; and Nobel laureates (and US subset thereof). Samples of early elected academicians were probed for unrecorded deaths; datasets overtly missing deaths were excluded from further analyses. Actuarial risks were compared against the general population in the same country in respective age strata. Relative incidence risk increases in death in active pandemic periods were compared to population-wide pandemic excess death estimates for the same country.Results Royal Society and Academy of Athens datasets overtly missed deaths. Pre-pandemic death rates were 4-12-fold lower in the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) versus respective age strata of the Mainland China population. A +158% relative increase in death risk was seen in CAE data during the first 12-months of wide viral spread. Both increases (+34% in British Academy) and decreases (-27% in US Nobel laureates) in death rates occurred in pandemic (2020-22) versus pre-pandemic (2017-2019) years; point estimates were far from known excess deaths in the respective countries (+6% and +14%, respectively). Published excess death estimates for urban-dwelling Mainland China selectively analyzed CAE, but not another Chinese academy (Chinese Academy of Sciences) with half the pandemic death rates.Conclusion Missingness, lack of representativeness, large uncertainty, and selective analysis reporting make data from academy rosters unreliable for estimating general population excess deaths."

Current diagnostic tools are inadequate, so urine proteomics was performed for patients with and without NEC to identify putative biomarkers.Research design and methods The abundance of urinary proteins detected using an aptamer-based microarray was compared for infants with NEC (n=20) and controls, age-matched (n=8) or self-matched (n=12). Spearman r correlation and hierarchical cluster analysis were performed. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC).Results Ninety-nine proteins differed in NEC vs. controls based on median fold change (Log2 ± 1.1) and significance (P < 0.05). Patterns of abundance were consistent for both types of matching, and samples clustered based on NEC severity. Two panels were built to differentiate between infants with and without NEC. Panel 1 included proteins associated with inflammation/NEC and produced by the intestinal epithelium (REG1B, REG3A, FABP2, DEFA5, AUC 0.90). Panel 2 consisted of proteins with the largest fold change between NEC vs. controls and the highest individual AUC values (REG1B, SSBP1, CRYZL1, ITM2B, IL36B, IL36RN, AUC 0.98).Conclusions Urine proteins significantly differ between infants with and without NEC, which supports their potential as future biomarkers.Download figureOpen in new tabGraphical abstract.

Investigating the factors that influence angiotensinogen levels, including sex hormones, may have important therapeutic implications.Methods Plasma angiotensinogen and sex hormones levels were measured in 5,171 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants. Linear models were employed to determine the associations of angiotensinogen with sex hormones, and mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of HT on blood pressure (BP) and hypertension through angiotensinogen.Results Angiotensinogen levels were significantly higher in postmenopausal women receiving HT (n=760) compared to women not receiving HRT (n=1,675) and in men (n=2,736). A positive association was present between angiotensinogen and estrogen levels that differed in magnitude between sexes and by HT status among postmenopausal women (women on HT: r=0.44, p< 0.0001; women not on HT: r=0.09, p=0.0002; and men: r= 0.07, p=0.0003). The type of HT formulation (estrogen or estrogen/progesterone) and its duration of use did not significantly affect angiotensinogen levels. HT indirectly increased systolic BP (β=1.24) and the odds of hypertension (OR=1.065) through its effect of increasing angiotensinogen.Conclusions A positive association was present between angiotensinogen and estrogen levels that differed by HT status. HT impacts systolic BP and hypertension indirectly by increasing angiotensinogen. This study underscores the role of angiotensinogen in hypertension, and the complex relationship between HT and hypertension."

Understanding the epidemiological parameters and transmission dynamics of LASV is crucial for informing evidence-based interventions and outbreak response strategies.Methods We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42023393345) to compile and analyse key epidemiological parameters, mathematical models, and past outbreaks of LASV. Data were double extracted from published literature, focusing on past outbreaks, seroprevalence, transmissibility, epidemiological delays, and disease severity.Findings We found 157 publications meeting our inclusion criteria and extracted 374 relevant parameter estimates. Although LASV is endemic in West Africa, spatiotemporal coverage of recent seroprevalence estimates, ranging from 0.06% to 35%, was poor. Highlighting the uncertainty in LASV risk spatially. Similarly, only two basic reproduction number estimates at 1.13 and 1.19 were available. We estimated a pooled total random effect case fatality ratio of 33.1% (95% CI: 25.7 – 41.5, I2 = 94%) and found potential variation in severity by geographic regions typically associated with specific LASV lineages. We estimated a pooled total random effect mean symptom-onset-to-hospital-admission delay of 8.3 days (95% CI: 7.4 – 9.3, I2 = 92%), but other epidemiological delays were poorly characterised.Interpretation Our findings highlight the relative lack of empirical LASV parameter estimates despite its high severity. Improved surveillance to capture mild cases and approaches that integrate rodent populations are needed to better understand LASV transmission dynamics.

Three on ribavirin as a Lassa fever treatment, two on Lassa virus (LASV) vaccine candidates, and one each on historical importations of Lassa fever cases from West Africa to non-endemic countries, clinical characteristics for protocol development, and Lassa fever in pregnancy. Two systematically reviewed epidemiological parameters. One on basic reproduction number estimates which ranged from 1.1 to 1.8 for human-to-human and 1.5 to 1.7 for rodent-to-rodent transmission. However, no meta-analyses were conducted. The other focused on LASV infection case fatality ratios (CFRs): 29.7% (22.3–37.5) in humans and prevalence: 8.7% (95% confidence interval: 6.8– 10.8) in humans, 3.2% (1.9–4.6) in rodents, and 0.7% (0.0–2.3) in other mammals. There were no systematic reviews on LASV transmission models.Added value of this study We provide a comprehensive overview of published outbreaks, transmission models and epidemiological parameters for LASV. We highlight the sparsity of key epidemiological parameter estimates such as the serial interval or generation time. The discrepancy between the high overall severity and the high seroprevalence in the general population suggests a high proportion of infections are asymptomatic or only result in mild disease. Therefore, current surveillance systems may need refining to better characterise LASV transmission dynamics.Implications of all the available evidence Epidemiological models are useful tools for real-time analysis of outbreaks, assessing epidemic trajectories and the impact of interventions. Our study is a useful basis to inform future LASV models, but highlights uncertainties and knowledge gaps that need to be filled in LASV transmission and natural history. Future LASV studies will benefit from integrating human and rodent reservoir surveillance."

To further assess the ability of engineering LLMs to improve reasoning abilities and performance, we examined responses with a zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach, CoT prompting, and a custom built GPT (PharmacyGPT). A 219 multiple-choice questions focused on critical care pharmacotherapy topics used in Doctor of Pharmacy curricula from two accredited colleges of pharmacy was compiled for this study. A total of five LLMs were evaluated: ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), ChatGPT (GPT-4), Claude2, Llama2-7b, and Llama2-13b. The primary outcome was response accuracy. Of the five LLMs tested, GPT-4 showed the highest average accuracy rate at 71.6%. A larger variance indicates lower consistency and reduced confidence in its answers. Llama2-13b had the lowest variance (0.070) of all the LLMs, but performed with an accuracy of 41.5%. Following analaysis of overall accuracy, performance on knowledge- vs. skill-based questions were assessed. All five LLMs demonstrated higher accuracy on knowledge-based questions compared to skill-based questions. GPT-4 had the highest accuracy for knowledge- and skill-based questions, with an accuracy of 87% and 67%, respectively. Response accuracy from LLMs in the domain of clinical pharmacy can be improved by using prompt engineering techniques."

However, characterizing the tumor microbiomes is extremely challenging because of their low biomass and severe difficulties in controlling laboratory-borne contaminants, which is further aggravated by lack of comprehensively effective computational approaches to identify unique or enriched microbial species associated with cancers. Here we take advantages of two recent computational advances, one by Poore et al (2020, Nature) that computationally generated the microbiome datasets of 33 cancer types [of 10481 patients, including primary tumor (PT), solid normal tissue (NT), and blood samples] from whole-genome and whole-transcriptome data deposited in “The Cancer Genome Atlas” (TCGA), another termed “specificity diversity framework” (SDF) developed recently by Ma (2023). By reanalyzing Poore’s datasets with the SDF framework, further augmented with complex network analysis, we produced the following catalogues of microbial species (archaea, bacteria and viruses) with statistical rigor including unique species (USs) and enriched species (ESs) in PT, NT, or blood tissues. We further reconstructed species specificity network (SSN) and cancer microbiome heterogeneity network (CHN) to identify core/periphery network structures, from which we gain insights on the codependency of microbial species distribution on landscape of cancer types, which seems to suggest that the codependency appears to be universal across all cancer types."

Individuals who were 20-years-old or older, had a positive Polymerase Chain Reaction test, were one month post-infection, and did not select “Nothing” to a question regarding PASC presence were included. The primary outcome was the presence of PASC at T2. The presence of general, respiratory, muscular, neurological, gastrointestinal, dermatological, and cardiac symptoms at T2 was also used as an outcome among patients with relevant symptoms at time 1 (T1). Exposure was measured using the Kessler distress scale (K6) at T1, and those whose K6 was 13 or higher were identified as having psychological distress. Marginal structure models with robust standard errors were used to examine the association between psychological distress at T1 and any PASC symptoms at T2, and the associations between psychological distress and each symptom at T2 among participants with relevant symptoms at T1.Results A total of 1674 patients were analyzed; 17%had psychological distress. ; In total, 818 (48.9%), 523 (31.2%), and 672 (40.1%) patients reported general, respiratory, and neurological symptoms at T1, respectively. Individuals with psychological distress had higher odds of any symptoms at T2 (Odds Ratio [OR] =1.81, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]= 1.08 – 3.03) and general and respiratory symptoms at T2 among participants with relevant symptoms at T1 (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.02 – 3.76; OR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.03 – 5.80).Conclusion Psychological distress in the post-acute phase may lead to prolonged PASC symptoms, mainly general and respiratory symptoms, at the 1-year follow-up in individuals with PASC.Key Messages Psychological distress before infection and during the acute phase predicts prolonged Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC); however, in individuals with PASC, it is unclear whether psychological distress during the post-acute phase predicts prolonged PASC. This longitudinal survey indicated that psychological distress in the post-acute phase led to prolonged any levels of PASC, especially general and respiratory symptoms, at the 1-year follow-up. Therefore, mental health care for individuals with PASC may help to improve or mitigate prolonged PASC."

The study device setup consists of a microphone placed underneath the nose and a smartphone to collect the data. We recruited patients who were referred to the St. Josephs Hamilton Sleep Clinic for a sleep study. Data from our study device is collected simultaneously with polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep lab. A total of 26 patients were recruited, of which 2 dropped out during the data collection. Data from the microphone was too noisy for interpretation in 3 patients. Across the remaining 21 patients, the AHI based on their PSG ranged from 2 to 125 events/h, with an average AHI of 34 events/h. We used regression models trained on microphone audio data to identify noise and we developed an algorithm based on root-mean-square of the audio data for automatic detection of apneas and hypopneas. With reference to the PSG, our study device had a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 87% in detecting apneas/hypopneas across a cumulative 120.9 hours of sleep data and more than 3700 such events. Our study device was able to accurately predict the AHI to within 4.3 events/h (+/-3.1). As such, we can conclude that our study device is accurate in identifying apneas/hypopneas, estimating the AHI and at ruling out cases of severe sleep apnea and can potentially be used as a screening test for this purpose. Our study device has the practical advantages of being very low cost and potentially more accessible as a screening tool, though further validation studies are needed to study accuracy across a larger population and for use at-home."

One solution to microbiologically contaminated water is boiling, often promoted without acknowledging the additional risks incurred from indoor air degradation from using solid fuels.Objectives This modeling study explores the tradeoff of increased air pollution from boiling drinking water under multiple contamination and fuel use scenarios typical of low-income settings.Methods We calculated the total change in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from indoor air pollution (IAP) and diarrhea from fecal contamination of drinking water for scenarios of different source water quality, boiling effectiveness, and stove type. We used Uganda and Vietnam, two countries with a high prevalence of water boiling and solid fuel use, as case studies.Results Boiling drinking water reduced the diarrhea disease burden by a mean of 1110 DALYs and 368 DALYs per 10,000 people for those under and over <5 years of age in Uganda, respectively, for high-risk water quality and the most efficient (lab-level) boiling scenario, with smaller reductions for less contaminated water and ineffective boiling. Similar results were found in Vietnam, though with fewer avoided DALYs in children under 5 due to different demographics. In both countries, for households with high baseline IAP from existing solid fuel use, adding water boiling to cooking on a given stove was associated with a limited increase in IAP DALYs due to the log-linear dose-response curves. Boiling, even at low effectiveness, was associated with net DALY reductions for medium- and high-risk water, even with unclean stoves/fuels. Use of clean stoves coupled with effective boiling significantly reduced total DALYs.Discussion Boiling water generally resulted in net decreases in DALYs. Future efforts should empirically measure health outcomes from IAP vs. diarrhea associated with boiling drinking water using field studies with different boiling methods and stove types."

We describe the creation, activities, and one-year impact of a faculty development program that included novel professional coaching training (the Clinical Faculty Mentoring Program, CFMP) which was supplemented by skills- and knowledge-building activities (the Clinical Faculty Development Series, CFDS).Methods The goals and components of the CFMP and CFDS are described in detail. A mixed methods evaluation plan guided collection of confidential survey and interview data before and after the first year of these activities. We used paired t-tests to identify statistically significant changes.Results The 43 clinical mentors reported significant gains in job satisfaction, teaching attitudes, knowledge of mentorship competencies, and confidence with coaching skills for mentorship (all p<0.05). Of mentor respondents, 88% found the coach approach to mentoring program to be “very” or “somewhat” helpful. Coaching behavioral domains with the greatest evidence of improvement were supporting the mentee to integrate new awareness, insight, learning into their worldview and behaviors (p=0.0503) and managing time and focus of mentoring sessions (p=0.022). All 37 mentees had at least one meeting with a mentor (100%). Over 9 months, 39 virtual CFDS sessions had an average participation of 38 participants (range 22-59). A majority of surveyed faculty (>55%) agreed or strongly agreed the CFDS sessions provided valuable opportunities for skills development with teaching, leadership, wellness, diversity, equity, inclusion, and promotion.Conclusions Among clinical mentors, our novel coach approach to clinical faculty mentoring and skill-building had favorable effects on job satisfaction, knowledge of mentorship competencies, and confidence in coaching skills. Outcomes from the clinical faculty development series supported the mentoring program outcomes. Longitudinal follow-up is needed to determine how this program will impact mentees."

A key research need now is for models to inform long-term vaccination policy. We aimed to review the variety of existing modelling methods, in order to identify gaps in the literature and highlight areas for future model development.Study design This study was a systematic review.Methods We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus from 1 January 2019 to 6 February 2023 for peer-reviewed, English-language articles describing age-structured, dynamic, mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission and vaccination in high-income countries that include waning immunity or reinfection. We extracted details of the structure, features and approach of each model and combined them in a narrative synthesis.Results Of the 1109 articles screened, 47 were included. Most studies used deterministic, compartmental models set in Europe or North America that simulated a time horizon of 3.5 years or less. Common outcomes included cases, hospital utilisation and deaths. Only nine models included long COVID, costs, life-years or quality of life-related measures. Two studies explored the potential impact of new variants beyond Omicron.Conclusions This review demonstrates a need for long-term models that focus on outcome measures such as quality-adjusted life years, the population-level effects of long COVID and the cost-effectiveness of future policies – all of which are essential considerations in the planning of long-term vaccination strategies."

In stroke patients, total WMH burden is linked to recurrent cerebrovascular events and worse clinical outcome. As WMH also affect the integrity of structural large-scale brain networks, we hypothesize that the extent of WMH-related network damage carries relevant information to explain outcome variability in addition to global WMH volume. Clinical and structural brain imaging data of 33 severely affected acute stroke patients were analysed from two independent cohorts. Imaging data were acquired within the first two weeks after stroke. WMH-related localized and global network damage was derived, involving cortical and subcortical brain regions of an extended motor network. Using ordinal logistic regression analyses, network damage was associated with functional outcome, operationalized by the modified Rankin Scale, at follow-up after three to six months. WMH were linked to a significant disconnection of multiple ipsilesional and contralesional cortical and subcortical brain regions. Global as well as localized periventricular WMH-related network damage affecting distinct brain regions of both hemispheres, including the precentral and the inferior frontal gyrus, areas of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the insula, and multiple subcortical nuclei, was independently associated with a worse outcome after adjustment for baseline symptom burden, age, brain infarct volume and total WMH volume. Total and deep WMH-related network disturbances did not show similar associations. This study shows that periventricular WMH-related network damage affecting specific brain regions of the frontal and insular lobe, and subcortical nuclei is linked to functional outcome in acute stroke patients. This supports the evolving concept of structural brain reserve and underscores the potential significance of pre-existing WMH-related network damage as a crucial factor in comprehending outcome variability after severe stroke."

However, few machine-readable databases of ADEs exist, limiting the opportunity to study drug safety on a broader, systematic scale. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing methods, such as BERT models, present an opportunity to accurately extract relevant information from unstructured biomedical text. As such, we fine-tuned a PubMedBERT model to extract ADE terms from descriptive text in FDA Structured Product Labels for prescription drugs. With this model, we achieve an F1 score of 0.90, AUROC of 0.92, and AUPR of 0.95 at extracting ADEs from the labels’ “Adverse Reactions”. We further utilize this method to extract serious ADEs from labels’ “Boxed Warnings”, and ADEs specifically noted for pediatric patients. Here, we present OnSIDES (ON-label SIDE effectS resource), a compiled, computable database of drug-ADE pairs generated with this method. OnSIDES contains more than 3.6 million drug-ADE pairs for 3,233 unique drug ingredient combinations extracted from 47,211 labels. Additionally, we expand this method to extract ADEs from drug labels of other major nations/regions - Japan, the UK, and the EU - to build a complementary OnSIDES-INTL database. To present potential applications, we used OnSIDES to predict novel drug targets and indications, analyze enrichment of ADEs across drug classes, and predict novel ADEs from chemical compound structures. We conclude that OnSIDES can be utilized as a comprehensive resource to study and enhance drug safety.One Sentence Summary OnSIDES is a large, comprehensive database of adverse drug events extracted from drug labels using natural language processing methods."

We identified 70 HFrEF and 10 HFpEF gene-hits, of which 58 are novel. In 14 known loci for unclassified HF, we identified HFrEF as the subtype responsible for the signal. HFrEF hits ZBTB17, MTSS1, PDLIM5, and MLIP and novel HFpEF hits NFATC2IP, and PABPC4 showed robustness to MR assumptions, support from orthogonal sources, compelling evidence on mechanism of action needed for therapeutic efficacy, and no evidence of an unacceptable safety profile. We strengthen the value of pathways such as ubiquitin-proteasome system, small ubiquitin-related modifier pathway, inflammation, and mitochondrial metabolism as potential therapeutic targets for HF management. We identified IL6R, ADM, and EDNRA as suggestive hits for HFrEF and LPA for HFrEF and HFpEF, which enhances the odds of success for existing cardiovascular investigational drugs targeting. These findings confirm the unique value of human genetic studies in HFrEF and HFpEF for discovery of novel targets and generation of therapeutic target profiles needed to initiate new validation programs in HFrEF and HFpEF preclinical models."

Control and ultimately, elimination of VL depends heavily on prompt case detection. However, a proportion of VL cases remain undiagnosed many months after symptom onset. Delay to diagnosis increases the chance of onward transmission, and poses a risk of resurgence in populations with waning immunity. We checked the spatial variation of delayed diagnosis of VL in Bihar, India and aimed to understand the potential driving factors of delayed diagnosis.Methods The spatial distribution of diagnostic delays was explored using a Bayesian model fit to geo-located cases using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach, assuming days of delay as Poisson-distributed and adjusting for individual-(age, sex, HIV) and local-level (recent incidence, vector control, health facility access) characteristics. Residual variance was modelled with an explicit spatial structure. Cumulative delays were estimated under different scenarios of active case detection coverage.Findings The 4,270 cases analysed were prone to excessive delays outside existing endemic “hot spots”, beyond the focus of interventions. Cases diagnosed within recently-affected blocks and villages experienced shorter delays on average (by 13% 95% Credible Interval [2.9% - 21.7%] and 7% [1.3% - 13.1%], respectively) than those in non-recently-affected areas.Interpretation Delays to VL diagnosis when incidence is low could influence whether transmission of the disease could be interrupted or resurges. Prioritising and narrowing surveillance to high-burden areas may increase the likelihood of excessive delays in diagnosis in peripheral areas. Active surveillance driven by observed incidence may lead to missing the risk posed by as-yet-undiagnosed cases in low-endemic areas, and such surveillance could be insufficient for achieving and sustaining elimination.Funding The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."

However, there is limited evidence to support evidence-based personalized decision-making on how to adapt disease modifying therapies treatments targeting no evidence of disease activity, while achieving better patient-relevant outcomes, fewer adverse events and improved care. Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is a sensitive measure of disease activity that captures and prognosticates disease worsening in RRMS. sNfL might therefore be instrumental for a patient-tailored treatment adaptation. We aim to assess whether 6-monthly sNfL monitoring in addition to usual care improves patient-relevant outcomes compared to usual care alone.Methods Pragmatic multicenter, 1:1 randomized, platform trial embedded in the Swiss MS Cohort (SMSC). All patients with RRMS in the SMSC for ≥1 year are eligible. We plan to include 915 patients with RRMS, randomly allocated to two groups with different care strategies, one of them new (group A), one of them usual care (group B). In group A, 6-monthly monitoring of sNfL will together with information on relapses, disability and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inform personalized treatment decisions (e.g., escalation or de-escalation) supported by pre-specified algorithms. In group B, patients will receive usual care with their usual 6- or 12- monthly visits. Two primary outcomes will be used: 1) evidence of disease activity (EDA3: occurrence of relapses, disability worsening, or MRI activity) and 2) quality of life (MQoL-54) using 24-month follow-up. The new treatment strategy with sNfL will be considered superior to usual care if either more patients have no EDA3, or their health-related quality of life increases. Data collection will be embedded within the SMSC using established trial-level quality procedures.Discussion MultiSCRIPT aims to be a platform where research and care are optimally combined to generate evidence to inform personalized decision-making in usual care. This approach aims to foster better personalized treatment and care strategies, at low cost and with rapid translation to clinical practice.Trial registration NCT06095271"

This phenomenon significantly impacts both individual health and healthcare systems. Low and Middle Income Countries face particular challenges, as their Primary Health Care (PHC) settings often lack the necessary human and material resources to effectively address the escalating healthcare demands of the older people. This study set out to explore the experiences of older people living with progressive multimorbidity in accessing PHC services in Malawi. Between July 2022 and January 2023, a total of sixty in-depth interviews were conducted with dyads of individuals aged ≥50 years and their caregivers, and twelve healthcare workers in three public hospitals across Malawi’s three administrative regions. The study employed a stratified selection of sites, ensuring representation from rural, peri-urban, and urban settings, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of diverse perspectives. Guided by the Andersen-Newman theoretical framework, the study assessed the barriers, facilitators, and need factors influencing PHC service utilization by the older people. Three themes, consistent across all sites emerged, encompassing barriers, facilitators, and need factors respectively. The themes include: (1) clinic environment: inconvenient clinic setup, reliable PHC services and research in diabetic foods; (2) geographical factors: bad road conditions, lack of comprehensive PHC at local health facility and need for community approaches; and (3) social factors: encompassing use of alternative medicine, transport support, perceived health care benefit and support with startup capital for small-scale businesses. This research highlights the impact of multiple factors on the access to and utilization of PHC services among older individuals, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced nationwide availability of such services. It strongly recommends a thorough investigation into successful practices implemented in diverse health facilities in Malawi, with a specific focus on addressing the unique healthcare needs of the older population."

It is imperative to comprehend the risk factors and prognosis of stroke in order to effectively manage individuals infected with HIV, particularly those who have not yet initiated HAART.Methods This retrospective cohort study investigates stroke prevalence among HIV patients on Protease Inhibitors-ART at Zambia’s Adult Infectious Disease Center from 2009 to 2019. Data from 2867 patients’ EHRs were analyzed for demographic, clinical, and mortality information. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from an anonymous electronic case system. We utilized descriptive analysis along with logistic regression and Bayesian Network Model models to elucidate the characteristics and predictors of stroke among HAART-naive PLWH.Results This study analyzed data from 2867 HIV patients on Protease Inhibitors-ART to assess stroke prevalence and associated risk factors. Of the cohort, 105 individuals had stroke (prevalence: 3.7%), primarily ischemic infarction (56.2%). Most patients were aged 30-55 years (64.4%) and male (90.2%). Common comorbidities included diabetes (3.8%), hypertension (12.2%), and opportunistic infections like CMV (27.9%) and PCP (36.1%). Mortality rate was 6.6%. Bayesian network modeling predicted post-stroke outcomes, identifying age, CD4 count, lipid profile, comorbidities, and previous cardiovascular events as significant predictors. These findings highlight the complex interplay of risk factors in stroke occurrence among HIV patients on ART.Conclusions Our findings highlight the significance of early screening for stroke, timely intervention for risk factors across various age groups, and management of CD4 count among HAART-naive PLWH in order to alleviate the burden of stroke. These insights are crucial for informing targeted interventions aimed at reducing the occurrence and mortality associated with stroke in this population."

Clinical assessment of lesions is also used for determining clinical progress and has been used to assess patient outcomes in clinical trials. However, there has been no investigation into whether clinicians can (i) identify Clade I mpox compared to other viral lesions (ii) differentiate between Clade I mpox lesion stages.Methodology/Principle findings The objective of this study was to evaluate inter-rater reliability and agreement between clinicians assessing lesions in patients with Clade I mpox. We presented clinicians with 17 images of Clade I mpox or varicella and asked them to independently indicate the most likely diagnosis – mpox or varicella – and to categorise the lesions according to their stage. When selecting the most likely diagnosis, accuracy varied across all images, the inter-rater reliability was poor (κ = 0.223; z = 10.1) and agreement was moderate (Po = 68%). When categorising lesions according to their type, if a single lesion type was present in the image, inter-rater reliability was moderate (κ =0.671, z = 40.6) and agreement was good (Po = 78%), but when multiple lesion types were shown in an image, both inter-rater reliability (κ =0.153, z = 10.5) and agreement (Po = 29%) decreased substantially.Conclusions This study demonstrates that there are presently limitations in using clinical assessment to diagnose Clade I mpox and evaluate lesion stage and treatment outcomes, which have an impact on clinical practice, public health and clinical trials. More robust indicators and tools are required to inform clinical, public-health, and research priorities, but these must be implementable in countries affected by mpox.Author summary Mpox is a zoonotic illness caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), for which there are two distinct sub-clades. Clade I is typically found in central Africa and is associated with worse patient outcomes than Clade II. Diagnosis of mpox is most commonly performed using PCR, but in settings with limited laboratory capacity diagnosis is usually performed on clinical grounds taking lesion presentation in to account. Lesion presentation is also used to assess patient outcomes in both clinical and research settings. However, there has been no investigation into whether clinicians can (i) identify Clade I mpox compared to other viral lesions (ii) differentiate between Clade I mpox lesion stages, which has important implications for clinical practice, research and public health. Our study, which presented 16 clinicians with 17 sets of images of Clade I mpox or varicella and asked them to i) provide the most likely diagnosis and ii) categorise the lesions in to their stages, demonstrates that there are presently limitations in using clinical assessment to diagnose Clade I mpox and evaluate lesion stage and treatment outcomes. Alternative methods and tools are therefore required that can be easily implemented in affected countries."

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.Summary SARS CoV-2 S1 Protein in CD16+ Monocytes Post-Vaccination"

There is conflicting evidence around the association between alcohol use behaviors and PrEP utilization. We explore the impact of alcohol use on PrEP initiation and continuation among South African men.Methods We performed a secondary analysis of data from a trial that included men aged 16-29 randomly selected from a demographic surveillance site in KwaZulu-Natal. All participants were referred to HIV and sexual health services, where those who were HIV negative and sexually active were offered oral PrEP. Alcohol consumption was assessed at monthly visits and categorized as: non-drinking (0), low/moderate risk drinking (1-5), and high/very high-risk drinking (6-12) based on AUDIT-C criteria. Primary outcomes were PrEP initiation and PrEP continuation defined as refilling prescriptions for >3 months. We fitted logistic regression models, adjusted for potential clinical and demographic confounders, to estimate relationships between PrEP initiation/continuation and reported alcohol use.Results Of the 325 men in the analytic cohort, the average age was 22.9 years (SD 3.6) and 131 (40%) had high/very high-risk alcohol consumption (AUDIT-C score ≥6). Men with the highest risk alcohol use also reported more frequent condomless sex (89%, vs 68% in no alcohol group). We found the greatest uptake of PrEP among the high/very high-risk alcohol group (46/131, 35%), followed by the low/moderate-risk group (17/53, 32%) and the no alcohol group (25/141, 18%). Those with high-risk alcohol use remained more likely to initiate PrEP compared to the no alcohol group in multivariable models adjusted for confounders (aOR 2.44 95% CI 1.29-4.60; p-value 0.006). Overall, only 30% (26/88) of men remained on PrEP at 3 months. Men with high/very high-risk drinking had similar PrEP continuation at 3 months compared to men who reported no alcohol use (aOR 1.02 95% CI: 0.28-3.86, p=0.98).Conclusions High-risk alcohol use is common among men in rural South Africa and associated with increased PrEP initiation. However, PrEP continuation was low overall, and similar across all levels of alcohol use. Hazardous alcohol use should not discourage PrEP implementation efforts to engage and retain young men."

In the literature, dozens of correlates have been identified at different (e.g., individual, environmental) levels, but there is little or no direct evidence for the mutual associations of these correlates. This study analysed 44 variables identified as theoretically and empirically relevant for PA to clarify the factors directly and indirectly associated with PA.Methods A cross-sectional survey dataset of 19,005 Japanese-speaking adults (mean age = 53.50 years, SD = 17.40; 9,706 women) was analysed. The data encompassed demographic and anthropometric variables; self-reported PA levels; perceived social support and environments (e.g., awareness of urban facilities for PA); psychological traits and health-behaviour characteristics (e.g., personality, motivation, self-efficacy, decisional balance, process of change strategies); and technology use (e.g., mobile health apps).Results Network analyses were performed to select meaningful associations (partial correlations) among variables, which identified nine variables directly positively associated with PA: job/employment status, self-efficacy, perceived social support, intrinsic motivation, stage of change, counter conditioning, self-reevaluation, environment, and technology use. Indirect associations (two-step neighbourhood) were identified for 40 (out of 44) variables, implying that most of the kwon PA-correlates are associated with PA—at least indirectly.Conclusion Direct association with PA was identified for variables specified at different (individual–environmental) levels. The estimated mediation relationships echo the significance of the multilevel perspective in understanding how people maintain (in)active lifestyles.What is already known on this topicResearch has identified numerous factors associated with physical activity (PA) to ascertain how people maintain physical inactivity and acquire healthier, more active lifestyles.Typically, empirical studies have investigated head-to-head associations between PA and PA-correlates, which do not, however, clarify the correlates’ mutual associations and the correlates that are directly and indirectly associated with PA.What this study addsWe assessed 44 variables (across individual to environmental levels) that are known to be empirically and theoretically associated with PA among 19,005 Japanese-speaking adults,These variables were submitted to a psychological network analysis, which identified direct association with PA for the following variables (after controlling for all the other variables in the analysis): job/employment status, self-efficacy, perceived social support, intrinsic motivation for PA, stage of change, process-of-change strategies (counter conditioning and self-reevaluation), environment, and mobile-health-app use.Age and motivation for PA showed the highest centrality in the estimated network, implying that these two have the maximum number of associations with other correlates.How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe results highlight the significance of the multilevel approach—that is, understanding (in)active lifestyles from the perspective of individual characteristics (demographic, psychological, behavioural aspects, etc.) as well as social and environmental factors surrounding each individual.Our estimated network will guide stakeholders to specify the factors they should target in their projects (e.g., PA promotion) and estimate how those targets correlate with other factors that may lead to active lifestyles."

However, early sepsis recognition can be a challenge at presentation when patients show symptoms difficult to distinguish from other acute conditions.We designed a pilot study to explore whether blood immune signatures could reveal early specific indicator profiles for patients meeting sepsis criteria upon admission at the hospital Emergency Department. We analysed blood samples from study-recruited sepsis-suspected patients (N=20) and of age-spanning healthy volunteers (N=12), using flow cytometry-based assays. 25 circulating inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (CCs) were measured from blood plasma, while freshly isolated unfixed blood leukocytes were immunophenotyped to ascertain major cell subsets representation and expression of activation markers, including chemokine receptors. We found that beside IL-6 and sCD14, blood levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 (two ligands of CXCR3) show good separation between healthy controls and sepsis-suspected patients. The abundance of CD4+ T cells was significantly reduced while the expression of chemokine receptors was altered on monocytes, B and all T cells from patients. In particular, we report substantial losses of CCR5-expressing monocytes and CXCR3/CCR5 double positive T cells. Full dataset analysis and post-hoc subgrouping of patients according to their diagnosis on discharge (confirmed or unconfirmed sepsis), identified CXCR3/CCR5 double expression on T cells as a separating characteristic within the study. Overall, our observational study suggests a new CCR5 and CXCL9-10/CXCR3 axis of dysregulation in early sepsis."

In low- and middle-income countries the diagnosis of pneumonia relies heavily on an accurate assessment of respiratory rate, which can be unreliable in nurses and clinicians with less advanced training. In order to inform more accurate measurements, we investigate the repeatability of the RRate app used by nurses in district hospitals in Uganda.Methods This secondary analysis included 3679 children aged 0-5 years. The dataset had two sequential measurements of respiratory rate using the RRate app. We measured the agreement between respiratory rate observations and clustering around fixed thresholds defined by WHO for fast breathing, which are 60 breaths per minute (bpm) for under two months (Age-1), 50 bpm for two to 12 months (Age-2), and 40 bpm for 12.1 to 60 months (Age-3). We then assessed the repeatability of the paired measurements using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC).Results The respiratory rate measurement took less than 15 seconds for 7,277 (98.9%) of the measurements. Despite respiratory rates clustering around the WHO fast-breathing thresholds, the breathing classification based on the thresholds was changed in only 12.6% of children. The mean (SD) respiratory rate by age group was 60 (13.1) bpm for Age-1, 49 (11.9) bpm for Age-2, and 38 (10.1) for Age-3, and the bias (Limits of Agreements) were 0.3 (-10.8 – 11.3), 0.4 (-8.5 – 9.3), and 0.1 (-6.8, 7.0) for Age-1, Age-2, and Age-3 respectively. Most importantly, the repeatability of the two respiratory rate measurements for the 3,679 children was high, with an ICC value (95% CI) of 0.95 (0.94 – 0.95).Discussion The RRate measurements were both efficient and repeatable. The simplicity, repeatability, and efficiency of the RRate app used by healthcare workers in LMICs supports more widespread adoption for clinical use."

However, statistics on mortality and causes of death in people with chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) have been difficult to determine. This systematic review aimed to determine the mortality rate in people with all types of CNCP and the associated causes and risk factors of death. MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) were searched on 23 March 2023 to identify epidemiological studies reporting mortality in people with CNCP. Nineteen observational studies were included. There were 28,740 deaths (7%) reported in a population of 438,593 people with CNCP (n=16 studies), giving a mortality rate of 6,553 deaths per 100,000 people. An exploratory meta-analysis found that the relationship between mortality and CNCP was statistically significant (mortality risk ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.22-1.77; n=11 studies) when comparing people with CNCP to those without pain. People with CNCP were more likely to die from cardiovascular disease whereas those without pain were more likely to die from malignancy, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Smoking, lower physical activity levels, and opioid use were risk factors for death in people with CNCP. This systematic review found that people with CNCP have a higher risk of mortality than people without chronic pain. To reduce mortality rates in people with CNCP, cardiovascular diseases and risk factors for death should be considered when managing people with CNCP."

However, in clinical trials of primary prevention, the benefits of anticoagulation were hampered by the risk of bleeding. If indices of cardiac blood stasis account for the risk of stroke, they may be useful to individualize primary prevention treatments.Methods We performed a cross-sectional study in patients with NIDCM and no history of atrial fibrillation (AF) from two sources: 1) a prospective enrollment of unselected patients with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction <45% and 2) a retrospective identification of patients with a history of previous cardioembolic neurological event. The primary endpoint integrated a history of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or the presence intraventricular thrombus, or a silent brain infarction (SBI) by imaging. From echocardiography, we calculated blood flow inside the LV and its residence time (RT). The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03415789).Results Of the 89 recruited patients, 18 showed a positive primary endpoint: 9 patients had a history stroke or TIA and another 9 were diagnosed with SBIs in the brain imaging. RT performed good to identify the primary endpoint (AUC (95% CI)= 0.75 (0.61-0.89), p= 0.001). A RT > 2.21 cycles showed a sensitivity of 0.88 (0.77-1.00) and specificity of 0.70 (0.10-0.81). When accounting only for identifying a history of stroke or TIA, AUC for RT was 0.92 (0.85-1.00) with and odds ratio= 7.2 (2.3 – 22.3) per cycle, p< 0.001.Conclusions In patients with NIDCM in sinus rhythm, stasis imaging derived from echocardiographyis is closely related to the burden of stroke. Stasis imaging may be useful to address stroke risk in patients with systolic dysfunction."

Identifying patients at high-risk of CA-UTIs is crucial in clinical practice. In this study, we developed and externally validated an explainable, prognostic prediction model of CA-UTIs among hospitalized individuals receiving urinary catheterization.Methods We applied a retrospective cohort paradigm to select data from a clinical research database covering three hospitals in Taiwan. We developed a prediction model using data from two hospitals and used the third hospital’s data for external validation. We selected predictors by a multivariate regression analysis through applying a Cox proportional-hazards model. Both statistical and computational machine learning algorithms were applied for predictive modeling: (1) ridge regression; (2) decision tree; (3) random forest (RF); (4) extreme gradient boosting; and (5) deep-insight visible neural network. We evaluated the calibration, clinical utility, and discrimination ability to choose the best model by the validation set. The Shapley additive explanation was used to assess the explainability of the best model.Results We included 122,417 instances from 20-to-75-year-old subjects with multiple visits (n=26,401) and multiple orders of urine catheterization per visit (n=35,230). Fourteen predictors were selected from 20 candidate variables. The best prediction model was the RF for predicting CA-UTIs within 6 days. It detected 97.63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 97.57%, 97.69%) CA-UTI positive, and 97.36% (95% CI: 97.29%, 97.42%) of individuals that were predicted to be CA-UTI negative were true negatives. Among those predicted to be CA-UTI positives, we expected 22.85% (95% CI: 22.79%, 22.92%) of them to truly be high-risk individuals. We also provide a web-based application and a paper-based nomogram for using the best model.Conclusions Our prediction model was clinically accurate by detecting most CA-UTI positive cases, while most predicted negative individuals were correctly ruled out. However, future studies are needed to prospectively evaluate the implementation, validity, and reliability of this prediction model among users of the web application and nomogram, and the model’s impacts on patient outcomes."

MAP2K1 mutations have been functionally classified into three groups according to their dependency on upstream RAS/RAF signaling. However, the clinical efficacy of MAPK pathway inhibitors (MAPKi) for MAP2K1 mutant tumors is not well defined. We sought to characterize the genomic and clinical landscape of MAP2K1 mutant tumors to evaluate the relationship between MAP2K1 mutation Class and clinical activity of MAPKi.METHODS We interrogated AACR GENIE (v13) to analyze solid tumors with MAP2K1 mutations. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published reports of patients with MAP2K1 mutant cancers treated with MAPKi according to PRISMA guidelines. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS In the AACR GENIE dataset, Class 2 MAP2K1 mutations (63%) were more prevalent than Class 1 (24%) and Class 3 (13%) mutations (P<0.0001). Co-occurring MAPK pathway activating mutations were more likely to occur in Class 1 versus Class 2 or 3 MAP2K1 mutant tumors (P<0.0001). Our systematic meta-analysis of the literature identified 46 patients with MAP2K1 mutant tumors who received MAPKi. In these patients, ORR was 28% and median PFS was 3.9 months. ORR did not differ according to MAP2K1 mutation class or cancer type. However, patients with Class 2 mutations experienced longer PFS (5.0 months) and DOR (23.8 months) compared to patients with Class 1, 3 or unclassified MAP2K1 mutations (PFS 3.5 months, P=0.04; DOR 4.2 months, P=0.02).CONCLUSION Patients with Class 2 MAP2K1 mutations represent a novel subgroup that may derive benefit from MAPKi. Prospective clinical studies with novel MAPKi regimens are warranted in these patients.Highlights- A meta-analysis describing clinical outcomes with MAPK targeted therapy in MAP2K1 mutant tumors.- Clinical validation of MAP2K1 mutation Class as a predictive biomarker.- Class 2 MAP2K1 mutations are sensitive to MEK-inhibitor containing regimens.Download figureOpen in new tab"

COVID-19 vaccination history of vaccinated subjects with reported symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was used to determine vaccination status. Subjects with their first COVID-19 vaccination within 7 days before the imputed date of infection were considered unvaccinated. Vaccination is assumed not to have a relevant effect on outcome risk for the first seven days and to be fully developed after between 14 and 21 days. The immunization profile of the source population was estimated from the number of subjects vaccinated by dose, date and age group as recorded in the Hessian COVID-19 vaccination registry. Effect estimates were obtained using logistic regression, fitted by a Bayesian approach. The first dose of COVID-19 vaccines had a measurable effect during the predominance of the Alpha and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2, but a smaller effect during Omicron predominance. Only during Alpha and Delta predominance did the second dose provide an added benefit. During Omicron predominance, the third dose provided additional protection, but that effect was smaller than for the Delta period. Comparison of our estimates with estimates using a conventional, not quasi-exchangeable, approach revealed substantial differences in some cases, without any recognizable pattern.PACS 0000, 1111MSC 0000, 1111Download figureOpen in new tabHighlightsWe propose a vaccine effectiveness (VE) study design for COVID-19 that is based on a modification of the screening method.

Using 2 large publicly available datasets, we developed transformer-based natural language processing models to map medication-related concepts from the EHR at a large and diverse healthcare system to standard concepts in OMOP CDM. We validated the model outputs against standard concepts manually mapped by clinicians. Our best model reached out-of-box accuracies of 96.5% in mapping the 200 most common drugs and 83.0% in mapping 200 random drugs in the EHR. For these tasks, this model outperformed a state-of-the-art large language model (SFR-Embedding-Mistral, 89.5% and 66.5% in accuracy for the two tasks), a widely-used software for schema mapping (Usagi, 90.0% and 70.0% in accuracy), and direct string match (7.5% and 7.5% accuracy). Transformer-based deep learning models outperform existing approaches in the standardized mapping of EHR elements and can facilitate an end-to-end automated EHR transformation pipeline."

Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) is an MR based modality that identifies local volume changes in the brain. Herein, we aimed to investigate whether plasma NfL measures can predict TBM findings derived from temporal lobe of brain in a one-year follow-up and which biomarker can predict cognitive function. A total of 480 participants with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal cognition (CN) were found eligible for inclusion from The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. There was a significant negative association between plasma NfL and TBM only when all subjects were pooled together at baseline (β = -0.139, P= 0.004). After one-year follow-up, 30 subjects with MCI converted to AD (MCI-AD) and others remained unchanged (CN, MCI, AD). Plasma NfL levels elevated significantly only in MCI group after one year (P<0.001). We found a significant reduction in TBM measurements at first-year compared to baseline in all groups (P<0.001 for all groups). Additionally, TBM average change rate was significantly higher in MCI-AD and AD groups (P<0.001 for both); however, plasma NfL average change rate was not significantly different between groups. TBM was significantly correlated with MMSE, MoCA, ADAS-11 and ADAS-13 scores in both MCI and AD patients at baseline and after one year, whereas plasma NfL was not. Overall, our findings indicate that plasma NfL is not reliably associated with TBM, and is less effective and sensitive than TBM in predicting dementia progression and cognitive performance. Hence, TBM reduction is not reflected in plasma NfL increment after one year follow-up."

The problem arises because early stage CKD has no overt symptoms and the current policy is to perform diagnostic tests (e.g. glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio) only when accompanied by risk factors such as old age, hypertension and diabetes. Genetic testing may be useful to identify those most likely to have CKD and who therefore may benefit from screening. This work describes the development of an algorithm termed RICK (for RIsk for Chronic Kidney disease) that employs a polygenic risk score for CKD plus clinical risk factors to identify people at risk. In data from the UK biobank, those in the top decile of RICK have a 4.4-fold increased risk of CKD, and about 34% of all those with CKD are included in this decile. Using RICK to selectively test those in the general population with highest risk may help in early identification of CKD and thereby facilitate early access to renal healthcare.Lay Summary One of the biggest challenges in renal health is that 80 – 90% of people with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) are undiagnosed, and thus do not access healthcare promptly.

While a major focus of the research community lies on the investigation of pain-free blood sampling and devices for venous blood analysis, menstruation blood remains a largely ignored sampling source. Growing evidence shows excellent correlation between biomarker levels in menstruation blood and venous blood for an entire clinical panel of analytes. Here, we introduce a wearable, microfluidic diagnostic platform integrated into standard hygiene pads for the electronic-free naked eye-readable direct detection of disease biomarkers in menstruation blood (MenstruAI). We demonstrate semi-quantitative biomarker detection from menstruation using infection and inflammation biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP), gynecological cancer biomarkers (CEA and CA-125), and endometriosis biomarker CA-125 as representative examples of relevant proteinaceous biomarkers. The color-changes induced by the presence of these biomarkers can be read-out by the naked eye as well as by a machine-learning algorithm implemented into a smartphone-app, enabling semi-quantitative analysis. The presented MenstruAI platform has the potential to revolutionize women’s health by providing a non-invasive, affordable, and accessible approach to health monitoring, potentially democratizing healthcare by making health services more available and equitable.

The related concepts of brain health and reserve may help to understand the observed differences in patient outcomes. Effective reserve (eR) quantifies the brain’s capacity to compensate for negative effects, while accounting for pre-existing disease burden. Here, we extend the concept of eR by including measures of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden and compare the utility of brain volume and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) to enhance its modeling capabilities.Design/Methods Acute ischemic stroke patients from a single center between 2003-2011 with available neuroimaging data were included in this study. Modified Rankin Score (mRS) at 90 days post admission was used to assess functional outcome. Neuroimaging data were analyzed using dedicated deep-learning enabled pipelines to extract measures of WMH, brain, and intracranial volumes (ICV). BPF is given as the ratio of brain volume to ICV. eR is defined as a latent variable using structural equation modeling that includes age, WMH volume, and either BPF or brain volume. Models were compared using Bayes Information Criterion (BIC).Results 476 patients were eligible for inclusion: median age 65.8 (interquartile range: 55.3-76.3) years, 65.3% male. There was an inverse association between eR and mRS in both brain volume and BPF models (path coefficients: -0.75 and -0.55, respectively; p<0.001). The model utilizing brain volume (BIC=4429.6) outperformed the model using BPF (BIC=4802.2).Conclusions In this work, we significantly extended the concept of eR and advanced its translational potential. The demonstrated association of higher eR and better post-stroke outcome signifies its potential as a descriptor of brain health, and a protective measure against acute ischemic injury."

Functional studies implicated SHROOM3, encoding an actin-binding protein involved in cell shaping, into podocyte barrier damage. Despite the locus was also found associated with electrolytes, hematological and cardiovascular traits, systematic explorations of functional variants across all the genes in the locus are lacking.We reconstructed haplotypes covering the whole locus on 12,834 participants to the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, using genotypes imputed on a whole-exome sequencing reference panel of a subsample of 3,422 participants. Haplotypes included 146 exonic and intronic variants over the four genes and were tested for association with 73 serum, urine and anthropometric traits, 172 serum metabolite and 148 plasma protein concentrations using linear regression models.We identified 11 haplotypes with 2% to 24% frequency. Compared to the most common haplotype, most haplotypes were associated with higher levels of the creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate and lower serum magnesium levels. The second most common haplotype (12% frequency) was additionally associated with lower dodecanoyl-, hydroxyvaleryl- and tiglyl-carnitine serum concentrations. A haplotype of 4% frequency was also associated with lower red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels. A haplotype of 2% frequency was associated with serum glutamine and putrescine concentrations. Cluster analysis revealed distinct groups of traits and of haplotypes.The FAM47E-SHROOM3 locus exhibits haplotype variability that corresponds to marked pleiotropic effects, implicating the existence of population subgroups with distinct biomarker profiles."

We examined whether IMF use predicts HCV and HIV incidence among a cohort of people who inject drugs (PWID) in San Diego, CA and Tijuana, Mexico.Methods PWID were recruited into a prospective cohort in two waves during 2020-2022, undergoing semi-annual interviewer-administered surveys, HIV and HCV serology through February 2024. Cox regression was conducted to examine predictors of seroconversion considering self-reported IMF use as a fixed or lagged, time-dependent covariate.Results Of 398 PWID at baseline, 67% resided in San Diego, 70% were male, median age was 43, 42% reported receptive needle sharing and 25% reported using IMF. Participants contributed a median of 6 semi-annual study visits (IQR:4-6). HCV incidence was 14.26 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 11.49-17.02), and HIV incidence was 1.29 (1.00-2.28). IMF was associated with HCV seroconversion, with a univariable hazard ratio (HR) of 1.68 (95%CI: 1.12-2.53) which remained significant in multivariable models (adjHR1.54; 95%CI:1.01-2.34). The direction of the relationship with HIV was similar, albeit not significant, with an HR of 2.53 (0.7-9.15).Conclusion We document a novel association between IMF and HCV seroconversion among PWID in Tijuana-San Diego. There was insufficient power to detect if a similar relationship held for HIV. IMF’s short half-life may destabilize PWID— increasing the need for repeat dosing and sharing smoking materials and syringes. Tailoring medication dosing for opioid use disorder and new preventative care approaches may reduce HCV transmission in the fentanyl era.Summary In this cohort study of people who inject drugs in Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, California, fentanyl use was independently associated with HCV seroconversion. Tailored treatment and prevention efforts are needed for patients using fentanyl to minimize blood-borne infections."

In this study, pregnant patients at the Mbodo Health Centre in Aluu, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, were asked to rate their prevalence of co-infection and related risk factors. 96 willing pregnant women gave consent for blood samples to be drawn, and ELISA and fast diagnostic kits were used to test the sera for Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C, and syphilis. Results showed that 31.0% of the pregnant women had Helicobacter pylori, but none had positive results for syphilis or the hepatitis C virus. The highest prevalence of H. pylori infection, as determined by ELISA, was observed in the age group 30-39 years (37.5%), married groups (32.7%), secondary school education (44.0%), students (40.0%), and Christian religion (31.3%). This finding demonstrated that H. pylori was more common in the study area than the other two pathogens. Pregnant women visiting the Primary Health Centre, Mbodo-Aluu, Rivers State had significant rates of H. pylori infection with no coinfection with HCV and syphilis. This study emphasises the necessity of integrated screening and treatment initiatives during antenatal care. However, preventing unfavourable pregnancy outcomes and lowering the risk of vertical transmission to the baby need the early detection and treatment of these pathogens. Therefore, it is important to emphasise good knowledge and education about the infection in this area."

Early detection using machine learning (ML) models offers a critical opportunity to improve care and reduce the burden of sepsis.Objective To externally validate the SepsisWatch ML model, initially developed at Duke University, in a community healthcare and assess its performance and clinical utility in early sepsis detection.Design This retrospective external validation study evaluated the performance of the SepsisWatch model in a new environment. Data from patient encounters at Summa Health’s emergency departments between 2020 and 2021 were used. The study analyzed the model’s ability to predict sepsis using a combination of static and dynamic patient data.Setting The study was conducted at Summa Health, a nonprofit healthcare system in Northeast Ohio, covering two emergency departments (EDs) associated with acute care hospitals, and two standalone EDs.Participants Encounters associated with adult patients in any of Summa Health’s four EDs were included. Encounters lasting <1 hour were excluded. Only the first 36 hours of each encounter were used in model evaluation.Intervention(s)/Exposure(s) The SepsisWatch model was used to predict sepsis based on patient data.Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) The primary outcomes measured were the model’s area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC).Results The study included 205,005 encounters from 101,584 unique patients. 54.7% (n = 112,223) patients were female and the mean age was 50 (IQR, [38,71]). The model demonstrated strong performance across the Summa Health system, with little variation across different sites. The AUROC ranged from 0.906 to 0.960, and the AUPRC ranged from 0.177 to 0.252 across the four sites.Conclusions and Relevance The external validation of the SepsisWatch model in a community health system setting confirmed its robust performance and portability across different geographical and demographic contexts. The study underscores the potential of advanced ML models in improving sepsis detection in both academic and community hospital settings, paving the way for prospective studies to measure the clinical and operational impact of such models in healthcare."

Among gliomas, Glioblastoma (GBM) is a glioma of the highest grade and associated with a grim prognosis, with a median overall survival of 15 months with and 3-4 months without therapy. We examined how clinical variables and molecular profiles may have affected overall survival (OS) at Sina Hospital in Tehran over the past ten years.Methods A retrospective study was conducted at Sina Hospital in Tehran, Iran, and examined patients ≥ 11 years with confirmed glioma diagnoses between 2012 and 2020. We evaluated the correlation between OS in GBM patients and sociodemographic as well as clinical factors, including age, gender, extent of tumor resection, tumor location, chemo/radiotherapy, and molecular profiling based on IDH1, MGMT, TERT, and EGFR status. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess patient survival.Results Following a comprehensive evaluation of medical records, 186 patients were enrolled in the study. The median OS was 20 months, with a 2-year survival rate of 62.5%. Among the 132 patients with available IDH measurements, 105 (79.5%) exhibited IDH1 wild-type tumors. Of the 132 patients with assessed MGMT methylation, 94 (71.2%) had MGMT methylated tumors. TERT promoter methylation was detected in 112 out of 132 cases (84.8%), while no methylation was observed in 20 cases (15.2%). Analyses using multivariable models revealed that age at histological grade (P < 0.0001), adjuvant radiotherapy (P < 0.014), IDH1 status (P < 0.026), and TERT promoter status (P < 0.030) were independently associated with OS.Conclusion The findings of this study demonstrate that patients with higher tumor histological grades who had received adjuvant radiotherapy, exhibited IDH1 mutations, or presented with TERT promoter mutations, experienced improved OS. The median survival time was 20 months, with 15.6% and 46.9% of patients surviving at 12 and 24 months, respectively."

However, we currently know little of the consequences of myopia on visual brain functions. Theoretical models point to a key role of optical blur in myopia’s natural history. Moreover, myopia is linked to long-lasting changes in cortical visual areas. We thus hypothesized that adults suffering from moderate myopia process visual stimuli under optical blur differently than emmetropic adults.Methods Emmetropes (n=12, males n=3, females n=9) and low to mild myopes (n=13, males n=4, females n=9) were tested in the condition of -3 diopters of lens-induced blur. Participants performed an illusory contour recognition task while high-density EEG was recorded and analyzed using an electrical neuroimaging framework.Results We provide evidence for cortical processing differences between emmetropes and mild myopes – both of whom were tested under -3D of defocus. From topographic modulations it followed that emmetropes and mild myopes engage (partially) distinct networks of brain regions. Source estimations localized these differences to the medial portion of the occipital pole. Moreover, the predominant topography of the VEP during this period not only correlated with SRE, but also was an excellent classifier of myopia vs. emmetropia. By contrast, our analyses provided no evidence for differences in visual completion processes.Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study of myopia pairing high density EEG and a behavioral task. Collectively, this pattern of findings supports a model of myopia wherein low-level visual cortices are impacted at relatively late post-stimulus processing stages."

However, most studies focused on PM2.5 mass rather than its chemical composition. PM2.5’s individual chemical components can have distinct, cumulative, and potentially synergistic health impacts. We investigated the associations of PM2.5’s composition and sources with ASCVD mortality, considering the combined associations and regional variations in the US. We used data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, (65,838,403 person-years) from 2000 to 2016. We estimated PM2.5 exposure using machine-learning models and attributed components to five source categories. We used Poisson survival models to assess the associations with the source categories. Higher ASCVD mortality risk (RR [95% CI] per interquartile range increase) was associated with oil combustion (1.050[1.049;1.051]), industrial (1.054[1.052;1.056]), coal/biomass burning (1.064[1.062;1.067]), and traffic sources (1.044[1.042;1.046]). Comparing source-specific effects within each region, oil combustion effects were more pronounced in the East and Midwest, and coal/biomass burning effects were more pronounced in the West and Southwest. In conclusion, we found higher ASCVD mortality risk associated with PM2.5, with differential effects across sources and US regions. These associations persisted even after limiting our sample to ZIP code-years with PM2.5 <9 μg/m3 - the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). This highlights the importance of consideration of local population characteristics and exposure patterns when assessing health risks associated with PM2.5."

Here, we investigated the fragmentation pattern of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in EO-PE patients. We uncovered that the nucleotide composition at the 5’ end (i.e. ends motif) of plasma cfDNA showed a unique pathological preference in EO-PE pregnancies and gestational-psychology preference in healthy pregnancies. By integrating 91 EO-PE specific motifs into a machine-learning model, we achieved accurate prediction of EO-PE development in early pregnancies. Remarkably, our model demonstrated robust performance in an independent cohort of 74 early pregnancies and 1,241 non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) samples with ultra-low sequencing depth. Additionally, we revealed that these PE-specific motif signatures lacked tissue specificity, originating extracellularly, and were associated with the abnormal concentration of DNA fragmentation factor subunit beta (DFFB) in EO-PE patients’ plasma. These findings establish the plasma DNA fragmentome as a non-invasive and cost-effective biomarker that can be simultaneously captured during NIPT for early EO-PE detection and provide valuable insights into cfDNA production mechanisms in preeclampsia patients."

Progressive conditions like PPA require monitoring, and as such, re-assessment. Re-assessment poses the high risk of being burdensome, destructive, and of little use to the patient. As such, there is a significant need to establish a validated and reliable measure that (1) poses minimal patient burden and (2) captures communication ability in a strengths-based manner that is representative of daily communication needs and challenges. A strengths-based approach to assessment is widely recognized as the optimal way to promote patient autonomy, minimize harm, and implement functional treatment protocols and strategies. To date, there are no strengths-based assessment tools that were developed for people living with PPA. This study protocol describes our work to address this gap in clinical practice and research."

Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties on the results.Results All-infants nirsevimab programs averted more RSV-related outcomes than year-round RSVpreF programs, with the most RSV cases averted in seasonal nirsevimab programs. Assuming list prices for these immunizing agents, all-infants nirsevimab and year-round RSVpreF programs were never cost-effective, with ICERs far exceeding commonly used cost-effectiveness thresholds. Seasonal nirsevimab with catch-up was cost-effective if prioritized for infants at moderate/high-risk (ICER <$28,000 per QALY) or those living in settings with higher RSV burden and healthcare costs (ICER of $5,700 per QALY). Using a $50,000 per QALY threshold, an all-infants nirsevimab program could be optimal if nirsevimab is priced at <$110-190 per dose. A year-round RSVpreF for all pregnant women/pregnant people plus nirsevimab for infants at high-risk was optimal if nirsevimab is priced at >$110-190 and RSVpreF priced at <$60-125.Interpretation Prophylactic interventions can substantially reduce RSV disease in infants, and targeted nirsevimab programs are the most cost-effective option at current product prices."

Despite several Ghanaian health policies to combat AIP, AIP is still on the rise. It becomes imperative to identify geographic-specific factors for developing appropriate interventions for the management of AIP. However, Kassena Nankana West District (KNWD) in the Upper East Region of Ghana lacks a study on anaemia risk factors, therefore, this study estimated the prevalence and risk factors for anaemia among pregnant women in the district.Methods A household-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 376 pregnant women in their third trimester from February to March 2023. Anthropometric, obstetric, sociodemographic, and health facility resource characteristics were collected using structured questionnaires and antenatal records. Mixed-effect logistic regression was used to identify independent factors of anaemia at 95% confidence interval.Results Prevalence of AIP was 53.9%. Mild, moderate, and severe anaemia prevalence was 16.9%, 35.3%, and 1.7% respectively. Malaria infection during pregnancy (aOR=1.563; 95%CI:1.087 – 2.475) and accessing health facilities without trained laboratory personnel (aOR=5.271; 95%CI:1.641 – 16.93) were associated with increased odds of AIP. Belonging to the major ethnic group (aOR=0.431; 95%CI:0.280 – 0.675), accessing health facilities without laboratory services (aOR=0.151; 95%CI:0.047 – 0.487), and accessing health facilities without sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine drugs (aOR=0.234; 95%CI:0.061 – 0.897) in KNWD were also associated with decreased odds of AIP.Conclusion AIP prevalence remains high in the KNWD. Maternal and health facility-related factors were responsible for anaemia in the district. These factors are preventable. Therefore, health facility strengthening and enhanced strategies for malaria prevention are recommended for anaemia control in the district."

The aim of our i-STRATIFICATION study is to provide evidence for stratifying patients with AF recurrence after PVI to optimal pharmacological and ablation therapies, through in-silico trials.Methods A cohort of 800 virtual patients, with variability in atrial anatomy, electrophysiology, and tissue structure (low voltage areas, LVA), was developed and validated against clinical data from ionic currents to ECG. Virtual patients presenting AF post-PVI underwent 13 secondary treatments.Results Sustained AF developed in 522 virtual patients after PVI. Second ablation procedures involving left atrial ablation alone showed 55% efficacy, only succeeding in small right atria (<60mL). When additional cavo-tricuspid isthmus ablation was considered, Marshall-Plan sufficed (66% efficacy) for small left atria (<90mL). For bigger left atria, a more aggressive ablation approach was required, such as anterior mitral line (75% efficacy) or posterior wall isolation plus mitral isthmus ablation (77% efficacy). Virtual patients with LVA greatly benefited from LVA ablation in the left and right atria (100% efficacy). Conversely, in the absence of LVA, synergistic ablation and pharmacotherapy could terminate AF. In the absence of ablation, the patient’s ionic current substrate modulated the response to antiarrhythmic drugs, being the inward currents critical for optimal stratification to amiodarone or vernakalant.Conclusion In-silico trials identify optimal strategies for AF treatment based on virtual patient characteristics, evidencing the power of human modelling and simulation as a clinical assisting tool."

Indwelling urethral catheterization can be associated with significant complications, such as nosocomial infections and urethral trauma, hence the contemporary national and institutional efforts to reduce indwelling urethral catheter usage.Objectives The purpose of this study is to investigate national trends in perioperative catheter usage across surgical procedure categories.Methods This is a retrospective study of adults who received indwelling urethral catheters during elective surgical procedures performed in United States (U.S.) hospitals during 2010-2017. We utilized the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) procedure codes to identify surgical procedure types and insertions of indwelling urethral catheters. Yearly catheterization rates were utilized to assess significant differences in nationwide temporal trends.Results We sampled 81,128,725 perioperative catheterizations across twelve procedure categories. When specific categories were examined separately, the annual proportion of procedures utilizing catheterization decreased for eye (−0.05% [95% CI, -0.10%; -0.02%], p-value 0.013), musculoskeletal (−0.04% [95% CI, -0.09%; 0.003%] p-value 0.063), and urinary system surgeries (−0.54% [95% CI, -0.76%; -0.33%] p-value 0.001). The proportion that utilized urethral catheters increased annually for female reproductive (+0.05% [95% CI, 0.04%; 0.07%] p-value <0.001), male reproductive (+0.31% [95% CI, 0.18%; 0.44%] p-value 0.001), and respiratory system surgeries (0.08% [95% CI, 0.02%; 0.13%] p-value 0.015). When all operative procedures were examined together, the overall annual proportion involving urethral catheterization did not significantly vary during 2010-2017.Conclusion Despite wide dissemination of clinical guidelines and institutional efforts to reduce catheterizations, we observed no significant changes in the overall proportion of all surgical procedures (irrespective of procedure category) that utilized urethral catheters during our study period."

Our exposures of interest were all outpatient medications prescribed during pregnancy. We limited our analyses to medication that met the minimal sample size (n=600). The primary outcome of interest was preterm birth. Secondary outcomes of interest were small for gestational age and low birth weight. We used propensity score matching at scale to evaluate the risk of these adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with drug exposure after adjusting for demographics, pregnancy characteristics, and comorbidities.Results The total medication prescription rate increased from 58.5% to 75.3% (P<0.0001) from 2013 to 2022. The prevalence rate of preterm birth was 7.7%. 175 out of 1329 prenatally prescribed outpatient medications met the minimum sample size. We identified 58 medications statistically significantly associated with the risk of preterm birth (P≤0.1; decreased: 12, increased: 46).Discussion We narrowed down from 1329 medications to 58 medications that showed statistically significant association with the risk of preterm birth even after addressing numerous covariates through propensity score matching.Conclusion This data-driven approach demonstrated that multiple testable hypotheses in pregnancy pharmacology can be prioritized at scale, laying the foundation for application in other pregnancy outcomes."

The major syndromic variants of PPA present with distinct profiles of linguistic deficits. However, current concepts and diagnosis of PPA are largely based on English-speaking patients, while few studies have explored how PPA syndromes might vary between languages. Here we undertook a comprehensive neuropsychological comparison of all major PPA syndromes in two languages with contrasting characteristics: Italian and English.Methods We retrospectively compared the PPA cohorts attending our specialist referral centres on neuropsychological tests sampling a range of linguistic and general cognitive domains. The cohorts comprised 106 native Italian-speakers with PPA (14 nonfluent/agrammatic variant [nfvPPA], 20 semantic variant [svPPA], 41 logopenic variant [lvPPA], 31 mixed PPA [mPPA]) and 166 native English-speakers with PPA (70 nfvPPA, 45 svPPA, 42 lvPPA, 9 mPPA). Neuropsychological scores were normalised to healthy older native speakers (adjusted for age and years of education) and dichotomised (impaired/unimpaired) to identify the proportion of each cohort showing impairment on each test. Cohorts were compared in logistic regression models, covarying for symptom duration and overall cognitive severity.Results The English PPA cohort was significantly younger (mean 62.7 years) than the Italian cohort (mean 65.9 years; p=0.003), with longer symptom duration (mean 4.6 vs 3.1 years; p=0.048), a higher proportion of nfvPPA cases (42% vs. 13%, p<0.001) and lower proportions of lvPPA (25% vs. 38%, p=0.019) and mPPA (5% vs. 29%, p<0.001). Compared with Italian-speaking patients, English-speaking nfvPPA patients had less frequent expressive agrammatism (p=0.015) and more frequently impaired single-word comprehension (p=0.013) and nonverbal working memory (p=0.041). English svPPA patients had more frequent surface dyslexia (p=0.046) and dysgraphia (p=0.021), while English lvPPA patients had more frequently impaired single-word comprehension (p<0.001), word repetition (p=0.02), nonverbal working memory (p=0.005) and visuospatial perception (p<0.001).Discussion Language-specific characteristics importantly influence PPA phenotypes: degeneration of language networks may predispose to expressive agrammatism in Italian (reflecting its morphological complexity) and to impaired spoken word processing and regularisation errors in English (reflecting its articulatory, acoustic and orthographic complexity). These findings have implications for diagnosis, management and cross-linguistic collaborative initiatives in PPA."

Previous analyses have primarily focused on patients with relatively mild to moderate deficits. However, outcomes vary among survivors of severe strokes, and the mechanisms of recovery remain poorly understood. This study assesses the association between lesion-induced network disconnection and outcome after severe stroke. Thirty-eight ischaemic stroke patients underwent MRI brain imaging early after stroke and longitudinal clinical follow-up. Lesion information was integrated with normative connectome data to infer individual disconnectome profiles on a localized regional and region-to-region pathway level. Ordinal logistic regressions were computed to link disconnectome information to the modified Rankin Scale after 3-6 months. Disconnections of ipsilesional frontal, parietal and temporal cortical brain areas were significantly associated with a worse motor outcome after a severe stroke, adjusted for the initial deficit, lesion volume, and age. The analysis of the underlying pathways mediating this association revealed location specific results: For frontal, prefrontal and temporal brain areas, the association was primarily driven by relatively sparse intrahemispheric disconnections. In contrast, the ipsilesional primary motor cortex, the dorsal premotor cortex, and various parietal brain regions showed a remarkable involvement of either frontoparietal intrahemispheric or additionally interhemispheric disconnections. These results indicate that localized disconnection of multiple regions embedded in the structural frontoparietal network correlates with worse outcome after severe stroke. Specifically, primary motor and parietal cortices might gain a particular importance as they structurally link frontoparietal networks of both hemispheres.

Besides typical clinical manifestations such as motor and sensory deficits, and fatigue, MS is characterized by structural and functional brain abnormalities, and by cognitive impairment such as decreased working memory (WM) performance.Objectives This study investigates the possible link between the polygenic risk for MS and WM performance in healthy adults aged 18 – 35 years. Additionally, it addresses in the same population the relationship between polygenic risk for MS and brain white matter properties, as represented by measures of fractional anisotropy (FA).Methods We generated a polygenic risk score (PRS) of MS and investigated its association with WM performance in a population of 3282 healthy adults, which consisted of two subsamples (N1=1803, N2=1479). The association between MS-PRS and FA was studied in the second subsample.Results MS-PRS was significantly associated with WM performance within the 10% lowest WM-performing individuals (p = 0.001; pFDR = 0.018). It was not significantly associated with any of the investigated FA measurements.Conclusions By identifying a genetic link between MS and WM performance, this study contributes to the understanding of the genetic complexity of MS, and hopefully to the possible identification of molecular pathways linked to cognitive deficits in MS."

Hip fractures are one of the most important and frequent fall-related injuries in LTC. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility (recruitment rate and adaptations) of implementing the PREVENT (Person-centred Routine Fracture PreEVENTion) model in practice, with a subobjective to understand facilitators and barriers. The model includes a multifactorial intervention on diet, exercise, environmental adaptations, hip protectors, medications (including calcium and vitamin D), and medication reviews to treat residents at high risk of fracture. Our secondary outcomes aimed to assess change in knowledge uptake of the guidelines among healthcare providers and in the proportion of fracture prevention prescriptions post-intervention. We conducted a mixed-methods non-experimental design study in three LTC homes across southern Ontario. A local champion was selected to guide the implementation. We reported recruitment rates using descriptive statistics and adaptations using content analysis. We reported changes in knowledge uptake using the paired sample t-test and the percentage of osteoporosis medications prescriptions using absolute change. Within five months, we recruited three LTC homes. We required two months to identify and train the local champion over three 1.5-hour train-the-trainer sessions, and the champion required three months to deliver the intervention to the healthcare team. We identified several facilitators, barriers, and adaptations. Benefits of the model include easy access to the Fracture Risk Scale, clear and succinct educational material catered to each healthcare professional, and an accredited educational module for physicians and nurses. Challenges included misperceptions between the differences in fall and fracture prevention strategies, fear of perceived side effects associated with fracture prevention medications, and time barriers with completing the audit report. Our study did not increase knowledge uptake of the guidelines, but there was an increase in the proportion of osteoporosis medication post-intervention."

Transmission dynamics driven by the contact rates (as normally occur in directly-transmitted or vector-transmitted diseases) only occurs when a parameter R* > 1. In this case, the forward transcritical bifurcation that exists for R* < 1, becomes a backward bifurcation, producing multiple steady-states, a hysteresis effect and dependence on initial conditions. A threshold parameter for an epidemic outbreak, independent of R* is only the ratio of the external contamination inflow shedding rate to the environmental clearance rate. R* describes the strength of the transmission to infectious classes other than the I-(acute) type infections. The epidemic outbreak conditions and the structure of R* appearing in this model are both resposible for the existence of endemic states."

The study aims to investigate the disparity of healthcare costs, including financial and time costs, among RHD patients in Uganda.Methods We enrolled 54 RHD households from the Uganda National RHD Registry between June 2019 and February 2021. The patients were interviewed in baseline and 12-month follow-up surveys. A random-effect model was applied to examine the disparity of RHD financial and time costs. Our primary outcomes are the total outpatient costs for RHD patients’ most recent visit, consisting of direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and time costs.Results Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the total financial cost of outpatient visits for RHD patients increased by 9 USD on average (P<0.01), with the change primarily driven by non-medical costs such as transportation and food (5.8 USD, P<0.05). Direct medical costs also increased significantly in the pandemic, with an average increase of 3.2 USD (P<0.1). Compared with their counterparts, non-medical costs were higher for patients with poor infrastructure, with less education, who were older, and who were male. Patients with employment experienced a higher time cost than those without (3.3 hours, P<0.01).Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased RHD outpatient costs, mainly caused by the increase in non-medical costs. Our study implies that improving infrastructure, investing in education, and providing employees with time to seek care have the potential to reduce non-medical barriers to RHD secondary prevention."

Even if high-resolution temporal contact data were routinely used for modelling, the role of this temporal network structure towards outbreak control is not well characterised. We address this by assessing dynamic networks across varied social settings in three ways. Firstly, we characterised the distribution of retained contacts over consecutive timesteps by developing a novel metric, the “retention index”, which accounts for the change in the number of contacts over consecutive timesteps on a normalised scale with the extremes representing fully static and fully dynamic networks. Secondly, we described the repetition of contacts over the days by estimating the frequency of contact pairs occurring over the study duration. Thirdly, we distinguish the difference between ‘superspreader’ and infectious individuals driving ‘superspreading events’ by estimating the connectivity of an individual (i.e. individual has high connectivity in a timestep if he accounts for 80% of the contacts in the timestep) and the frequency of exhibiting high connectivity. Using 11 networks from 5 settings studied over 3–10 days, we estimated that more than 80% of the individuals in most settings were highly connected for only short periods. This suggests a challenge to identify ‘superspreaders’, and more individuals would need to be targeted as part of outbreak interventions to achieve the same reduction in transmission as predicted from a static network. Taking into account repeated contacts over multiple days, we estimated simple resource planning models might overestimate the number of contacts made by an infector by 20%–70%. In workplaces and schools, contacts in the same department accounted for most of the retained contacts. Hence, outbreak control measures would be better off targeting specific sub-populations in these settings to reduce transmission. In contrast, no obvious type of contact dominated the retained contacts in hospitals, so reducing the risk of disease introduction is critical to avoid disrupting the interdependent work functions. This study identified key epidemiological properties of temporal networks that potentially shape outbreak dynamics and illustrated the need for incorporating such properties in outbreak simulations.Significance Directly transmitted infectious diseases spread through social contacts that can change over time. Modelling studies have largely focused on simplifying these contact patterns to predict outbreaks but the assumptions on contact patterns may bias results and, in turn, conclusions on the effectiveness of control measures. An ongoing challenge is, therefore, how to measure key properties of complex and dynamic networks to facilitate the development of network disease simulation models, which ensures that outbreak analysis is transparent and interpretable in the real-world context. To address this challenge, we analysed 11 networks from 5 different settings and developed new metrics to capture crucial epidemiological features of these networks. We showed that there is an inherent difficulty in identifying individual ‘superspreaders’ reliably in most networks. In addition, the key types of individuals driving transmission vary across settings, thus requiring different outbreak control measures to reduce disease transmission or the risk of introduction. Simple models to mimic disease transmission in temporal networks may not capture the repeated contacts over the days, and hence could incorrectly estimate the resources required for outbreak control. Our study characterised temporal network data in epidemiologically relevant ways and is a step towards developing simplified contact networks to capture real-world contact patterns for future outbreak simulation studies."

Computational models are vital tools that provide insights into illness progression and enable early detection, proactive intervention, and targeted preventive measures.This paper introduces Sybil, a framework that integrates machine learning and variant-aware compartmental models, leveraging a fusion of data-centric and analytic methodologies. To validate and evaluate Sybil’s forecasts, we employed COVID-19 data from two European countries. The dataset included the number of new and recovered cases, fatalities, and variant presence over time. We evaluate the forecasting precision of Sybil in periods in which there is a change in the trend of the pandemic evolution or a new variant appears. Results demonstrate that Sybil outperforms a conventional data-centric approach, being able to forecast accurately the changes in the trend, the magnitude of these changes, and the future prevalence of new variants."

Retrospective Cohort Study","AbstractCardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment is key to rational decision-making in primary prevention. The CVD risk depends on dynamic factors requiring continuous equation updates.Design The Abu Dhabi Risk Study (ADRS) is the first and longest-duration retrospective cohort study in Abu Dhabi and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), aiming to develop 10-year risk prediction equations for CAD, stroke, and ASCVD (Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, combining CAD and stroke) and validate international risk equations.Method The included 8699 subjects are participants of the national cardiovascular screening program of 2011-2013 with an average follow-up of 9.2 years. They were assessed retrospectively in 2023 for health outcomes. The validation cohort, 2554 subjects, is another community-based screening program done in Abu Dhabi in the period from 2016 and 2017. With an average follow-up of 6.67 years.Results Of 8504 who were ASCVD-free, 250 had new coronary artery events. Identified risk factors for ASCVD in this population were the conventional risk factors such as age, gender, smoking, high cholesterol/HDL ratio, and diabetes diagnosis, in addition to low vitamin D level, and low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) levels.Three ADRS prediction models were derived from Cox regression. The ADRS-CAD had a C- statistic of 0.899 compared to 0.828 of FRS (Framingham score) in the same population.ADRS-Stroke had a c-statistic of 0.904. The ADRS-ASCVD had a c-statistic of 0.898 compared to 0.891 of PCE (pooled cohort equations) and 0.825 of FRS-CVD.Applying the developed formulas to the validation cohort showed good predictability of CAD and ASCVD events with an ASCVD c-statistic of 0.825, for CAD the c-statistic was 0.799, and for stroke, it was 0.761. The PCE showed similar performance in this cohort with a c-statistic for ASCVD of 0.824.Conclusion This study demonstrated the value of tailoring risk assessments to local populations and healthcare contexts."

Alarmingly, standard practices for statistical regression analysis introduce racial biases into the estimation and presentation of these race-modified effects. We introduce abundance-based constraints (ABCs) to eliminate these racial biases. ABCs offer a remarkable invariance property: estimates and inference for main effects are nearly unchanged by the inclusion of race-modifiers. Thus, quantitative researchers can estimate race-specific effects “for free”—without sacrificing parameter interpretability, equitability, or statistical efficiency. The benefits extend to prominent statistical learning techniques, especially regularization and selection. We leverage these tools to estimate the joint effects of environmental, social, and other factors on 4th end-of-grade readings scores for students in North Carolina (n = 27, 638) and identify race-modified effects for racial (residential) isolation, PM2.5 exposure, and mother’s age at birth."

Existing drug delivery methods rely integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for CNS penetration. Here we showed that the microchannels between the skull marrow and the dura mater could be harnessed for drug delivery by intracalvariosseous (ICO) injection. Drugs administered via ICO injection were found to reach cranial bone marrow-dura-perivascular space, and the injection procedure did not cause osteomyelitis or BBB damage. To validate this approach, we examined the efficacy of two neuroprotective agents, NA-1 and Y-3, via ICO injection in rat model of stroke and found that ICO injection increased drug accumulation in the brain compared to intravenous injection, reduced infarct area and alleviated neurological deficits. We subsequently conducted a clinical trial to assess the safety of ICO in acute ischemic stroke patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05849805), showing that ICO injection was feasible and safe in humans and its therapeutic effects may be observed. Collectively, our study identifies that the microchannels between the skull bone marrow and the dura mater act as a new channel for CNS drug delivery to achieve high intracranial drug exposure in a short period of time. The safety of ICO injection makes it a promising route of drug administration for CNS diseases."

Using AI to determine adherence to reporting guidelines,"AbstractImportance Adherence to established reporting guidelines can improve clinical trial reporting standards, but attempts to improve adherence have produced mixed results.Objective This exploratory study aimed to determine how accurate Large Language Model generative AI systems (AI-LLM) were for determining reporting guideline compliance in a sample of clinical trial reports.Design, Setting, and Participants In this cross-sectional study, the OpenAI GPT-4 and Meta LLama2 AI-LLM were evaluated for their ability to determine reporting guideline adherence in a sample of 113 published sports medicine and exercise science clinical trial reports. For each paper, the GPT-4-Turbo and Llama 2 70B models were prompted to answer a series of nine reporting guideline questions about the text of the article. The GPT-4-Vision model was prompted to answer two additional reporting guideline questions about the participant flow diagram in a subset of articles. The dataset was randomly split (80/20) into a TRAIN and TEST dataset. Hyperparameter and fine-tuning were performed using the TRAIN dataset. The Llama2 model was fine-tuned using the data from the GPT-4-Turbo analysis of the TRAIN dataset.Main Outcome Model performance (F1-score, classification accuracy) was assessed using the TEST dataset.Results Across all questions about the article text, the GPT-4-Turbo AI-LLM demonstrated acceptable performance (F1-score = 0.89, accuracy[95% CI] = 90%[85-94%]). Accuracy for all reporting guidelines was > 80%. The Llama2 model accuracy was initially poor (F1-score = 0.63, accuracy[95%CI] = 64%[57-71%]), and improved with fine-tuning (F1-score = 0.84, accuracy[95%CI] = 83%[77-88%]). The GPT-4-Vision model accurately identified all participant flow diagrams (accuracy[95% CI] = 100%[89-100%]) but was less accurate at identifying when details were missing from the flow diagram (accuracy[95% CI] = 57%[39-73%]).Conclusions and Relevance Both the GPT-4 and fine-tuned Llama2 AI-LLMs showed promise as tools for assessing reporting guideline compliance. Next steps should include developing an efficient, open-source AI-LLM and exploring methods to improve model accuracy.Key Points Question: How accurately can Large Language Models determine adherence to clinical trial reporting guidelines?Findings: In this cross-sectional study, the GPT-4 Large Langue Model accurately (∼90%) determined reporting guidelines adherence in a sample of 113 randomized clinical trial trials. Following fine-tuning, the open-source Llama2 70B model achieved acceptable overall accuracy (∼84%).Meaning: A Large Language Model such as GPT-4 could be used by journals, peer reviewers and authors to quickly and accurately check clinical trial reporting guideline adherence."

Herein, we present results of the largest trans-ancestral genome wide association study for miscarriage to date, based on 334,593 cases of sporadic, and 52,087 cases of recurrent miscarriage in the 23andMe, Inc. Research Cohort. We identified 10 novel genome-wide significant associations for sporadic miscarriage, and one for recurrent miscarriage. These loci mapped to genes with roles in neural development and telomere length, and to developmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder. Three variants, with similar directionality and magnitude of effect, replicated in a previously published GWAS. Using Mendelian randomization and triangulation, robust evidence was found for smoking causally increasing the risk of sporadic (genetic liability to ever vs never smoking: OR 1.13; 95%CI: 1.11-1.15; P=2.61e-42) and recurrent (OR 1.25; 95%CI: 1.21-1.30; P=5.47e-34) miscarriage, with moderate, yet triangulating, evidence identified for a potential etiological role of caffeine consumption."

In this manuscript, three acute LBP severity categorization definitions were used based on LBP frequency combined with either 1) pain impact frequency (impact-based) or 2) pain intensity (intensity-based), as well as LBP pain interference frequency (interference only-based) severity categories. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe and then compare these acute LBP severity groups in the following characteristics: 1) sociodemographic, 2) general and physical health, and 3) psychological. This cross-sectional study used baseline data from 131 community-based participants with acute LBP (<4 weeks duration before screening and ≥30 pain-free days before acute LBP onset). Descriptive associations were calculated as prevalence ratios for categorical variables and Hedges’ g for continuous variables. Our analyses identified several large associations for impact-based and intensity-based categories with global mental health, global physical health, STarT Back Screening Tool risk category, and general health. Larger associations were found with social constructs (racially and ethnically minoritized, performance of social roles, and isolation) when using the intensity-based versus impact-based categorization. The interference-based category did not capture as much variability between acute LBP severity categories. This study adds to the literature by providing standard ways to characterize community-based individuals experiencing acute LBP. The robust differences observed between these categorization approaches suggest that how we define acute LBP severity is consequential; these different approaches may be used to improve the early identification of factors potentially contributing to the development of chronic LBP."

Modified Vaccinia Ankara Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) has been approved in its liquid-frozen (LF) formulation for prevention of smallpox and mpox in the US, Canada and EU. A freeze-dried (FD) formulation might confer additional benefits such as longer shelf life and less reliance on cold chain storage and transport, thus can better meet the potential challenge of large quantity vaccine deployment in emergency situations.In a phase 2 clinical trial, 651 vaccinia-naïve participants were vaccinated with two doses of MVA-BN LF or FD, 4 weeks apart. The objectives were to compare MVA-BN FD with LF in terms of vaccine-induced immune responses, safety and reactogenicity.Strong vaccinia-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were induced by both formulations, with peak humoral responses at Week 6 and peak cellular responses at Week 2. At Week 6, geometric means of total antibody titers were 1096 (95% CI 1013, 1186) from the FD group and 877 (95% CI 804, 956) from the LF group, achieving the primary endpoint of non-inferiority of MVA-BN FD compared to MVA-BN LF. At Week 2, geometric means of T cell spot forming units were 449 (95% CI 341, 590) from the FD group and 316 (95% CI 234, 427) from the LF group. Both formulations of MVA-BN were well tolerated, with similar unsolicited AEs and solicited systemic reactions in both groups but slightly higher local reactions in the FD group. No vaccine related serious adverse events (SAEs) or vaccine related AE of special interest were reported.The FD formulation of MVA-BN was shown to be equivalent to the LF formulation in immunogenicity, and comparable safety findings were observed from both formulations.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT01668537Highlights Equivalence of MVA-BN freeze-dried and liquid-frozen formulations in immunogenicity MVA-BN FD and MVA-BN LF are comparable in clinical safety and reactogenicity Peak T cell responses were observed 2 weeks after the first vaccination"

A scientometric analysis of over 150,000 studies and 49,000 authors published in high-impact medical journals between 2007 and 2022","AbstractBackground Health research that significantly impacts global clinical practice and policy is often published in high-impact factor (IF) medical journals. These outlets play a pivotal role in the worldwide dissemination of novel medical knowledge. However, researchers identifying as women and those affiliated with institutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have been largely underrepresented in high-IF journals across multiple fields of medicine. To evaluate disparities in gender and geographical representation among authors who have published in any of five top general medical journals, we conducted scientometric analyses using a large-scale dataset extracted from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), The British Medical Journal (BMJ), The Lancet, and Nature Medicine.Methods Author metadata from all articles published in the selected journals between 2007 and 2022 were collected using the DimensionsAI platform. The Genderize.io API was then utilized to infer each author’s likely gender based on their extracted first name. The World Bank country classification was used to map countries associated with researcher affiliations to the LMIC or the high-income country (HIC) category. We characterized the overall gender and country income category representation across the medical journals. In addition, we computed article-level diversity metrics and contrasted their distributions across the journals.Findings We studied 151,536 authors across 49,764 articles published in five top medical journals, over a long period spanning 15 years. On average, approximately one-third (33.1%) of the authors of a given paper were inferred to be women; this result was consistent across the journals we studied. Further, 86.6% of the teams were exclusively composed of HIC authors; in contrast, only 3.9% were exclusively composed of LMIC authors. The probability of serving as the first or last author was significantly higher if the author was inferred to be a man (18.1% vs 16.8%, P < .01) or was affiliated with an institution in a HIC (16.9% vs 15.5%, P < .01). Our primary finding reveals that having a diverse team promotes further diversity, within the same dimension (i.e., gender or geography) and across dimensions. Notably, papers with at least one woman among the authors were more likely to also involve at least two LMIC authors (11.7% versus 10.4% in baseline, P < .001; based on inferred gender); conversely, papers with at least one LMIC author were more likely to also involve at least two women (49.4% versus 37.6%, P < .001; based on inferred gender).Conclusion We provide a scientometric framework to assess authorship diversity. Our research suggests that the inclusiveness of high-impact medical journals is limited in terms of both gender and geography. We advocate for medical journals to adopt policies and practices that promote greater diversity and collaborative research. In addition, our findings offer a first step towards understanding the composition of teams conducting medical research globally and an opportunity for individual authors to reflect on their own collaborative research practices and possibilities to cultivate more diverse partnerships in their work."

However, recent evidence questioned the role of alpha power as a marker of consciousness and proposed the spectral exponent and spatial gradient as more robust and generalizable indexes. In this study, we analyzed a large-scale dataset of 260 unresponsive patients and investigated etiology-specific markers of level of consciousness, responsiveness and capacity to recover. We compare a set of candidate EEG makers: 1) absolute, relative and flattened alpha power; 2) spatial ratios; 3) the spectral exponent; and 4) signal complexity. Our results support the claim that alpha power is an etiology-specific marker, which has higher diagnostic value for anoxic patients. Meanwhile, the spectral slope showed diagnostic value for non-anoxic patients only. Changes in relative power and signal complexity were largely attributable to changes in the spectral slope. Grouping unresponsive patients from different etiologies together can confound or obscure the diagnostic value of different EEG markers of consciousness. Our study highlights the importance of analyzing different etiologies independently and emphasizes the need to develop clinical markers which better account for inter-individual and etiology-dependent differences."

In mice, M1AP interacts with the ZZS proteins SHOC1, TEX11, and SPO16, which promote DNA crossover formation during meiosis. To determine whether M1AP and ZZS proteins are involved in human male infertility by disrupting crossover formation, we screened for biallelic or hemizygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants in the encoding human genes to select men with a presumed protein deficiency; we compiled N=10 men for M1AP, N=4 for SHOC1, N=9 for TEX11, and the first homozygous LoF variant in SPO16 in an infertile man. After in-depth characterisation of the testicular phenotype of these men, we identified gene-specific meiotic impairments: men with SHOC1, TEX11, or SPO16 deficiency shared an early meiotic arrest lacking haploid germ cells. All men with LoF variants in M1AP exhibited a predominant metaphase I arrest with rare haploid round spermatids, and six men even produced sporadic elongated spermatids. These differences were explained by different recombination failures: abrogated SHOC1, TEX11, or SPO16 led to incorrect synapsis of homologous chromosomes and unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). On the contrary, abolished M1AP did not affect synapsis and DSB repair but led to a reduced number of crossover events. Notably, medically assisted reproduction resulted in the birth of a healthy child, offering the possibility of fatherhood to men with LoF variants in M1AP. Our study establishes M1AP as an important, but not essential, catalyser in the network of ZZS-mediated meiotic recombination."

A shorter survey was employed for sites that expressed interest in participating in Global PARITY and started the approval process, but ultimately did not participate in data collection (non-participating sites) to assess IRB characteristics.Subjects PIs from the Global PARITY StudyInterventions None.Results Ninety-one sites pursued local IRB approval and 46 sites obtained IRB approval and completed data collection. Forty-six (100 %) participating centers and 21 (47%) non-participant centers completed the survey. Despite receiving approval from the study’s lead center and being categorized as a minimal risk study, 36 (78%) of the hospitals involved in PARITY study required their own full board review. There was a significant difference between participating and non-participating sites in IRB approval of a waiver consent and in the requirement for a legal review of the protocol. The greatest challenge to research identified by non-participating sites was a lack of research time and the lack of institutional support.Conclusions Global collaborative research is crucial to increase our understanding of pediatric critical care conditions in hospitals of all resource-levels and IRBs are required to ensure that this research complies with ethical standards. Critical barriers restrict research activities in some resource limiting countries. Increasing the efficiency and accessibility of local IRB review could greatly impact participation of resource limited sites and enrollment of vulnerable populations."

We compare intra-patient subtype assigned in the cortex and spinal cord, finding modest agreement between the cortex and lumbar region specifically, ranging from 46.2 – 66.7%. We leverage differential expression analysis to identify seven marker genes for the oxidative stress (ALS-Ox) subtype that show consistent upregulation in both the cortex and spinal cord and utilize three to construct classifiers that achieve notable predictive power for the ALS-Ox subtype in three different holdout cohorts, with AUCs ranging from 0.81 – 0.89. Our study shows the ALS-Ox subtype is conserved in the spinal cord of the same patients, offering a postmortem foundation for clinical stratification."

The HWE analysis distinctively requires disease cases without the need for controls and demonstrates a notable ability in mapping recessive variants. Allelic heterogeneity is a common phenomenon in diseases. While gene-based case-control association analysis successfully incorporates this heterogeneity, there are no such approaches for HWE analysis. Therefore, we proposed a gene-based HWE test (gene-HWT) by aggregating single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-level HWE test statistics in a gene to address allelic heterogeneity.Results This method used only genotype count data and publicly available linkage disequilibrium information and has a very low computational cost. Extensive simulations demonstrated that gene-HWT effectively controls the type I error at a low significance level and outperforms SNP-level HWE test in power when there are multiple causal variants within a gene. Using gene-HWT, we analyzed genotype count data from genome-wide association study for six types of cancers in Japanese individuals and found that most of the genes detected are associated with cancers. In addition, we identified novel genes (AGBL3 and PSORS1C1), novel variants in CTSO known to be associated with breast cancer prognosis and drug sensitivity, and novel genes as germline factors, which have associations in gene expression or methylation status with cancers in the combined analysis of six types of cancers.Conclusions These findings indicate the potential of gene-HWT to elucidate the genetic basis of complex diseases, including cancer."

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have provided insights into the role of genetic variants in CHD pathogenesis through the identification of a comprehensive set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Notably, 90-95% of these variants reside in the noncoding genome, complicating the understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Here, we developed a systematic computational pipeline for the identification and analysis of CHD-associated SNPs spanning both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. Initially, we curated a thorough dataset of SNPs from GWAS-catalog and ClinVar database and filtered them based on CHD-related traits. Subsequently, these CHD-SNPs were annotated and categorized into noncoding and coding regions based on their location. To study the functional implications of noncoding CHD-SNPs, we cross-validated them with enhancer-specific histone modification marks from developing human heart across 9 Carnegie stages and identified potential cardiac enhancers. This approach led to the identification of 2,056 CHD-associated putative enhancers (CHD-enhancers), 38.9% of them overlapping with known enhancers catalogued in human enhancer disease database. We identified heart-related transcription factor binding sites within these CHD-enhancers, offering insights into the impact of SNPs on TF binding. Conservation analysis further revealed that many of these CHD-enhancers were highly conserved across vertebrates, suggesting their evolutionary significance. Utilizing heart-specific expression quantitative trait loci data, we further identified a subset of 63 CHD-SNPs with regulatory potential distributed across various cardiac tissues. Concurrently, coding CHD-SNPs were represented as a protein interaction network and its subsequent binding energy analysis focused on a pair of proteins within this network, pinpointed a deleterious coding CHD-SNP, rs770030288, located in C2 domain of MYBPC3 protein. Overall, our findings demonstrate that SNPs have the potential to disrupt gene regulatory systems, either by affecting enhancer sequences or modulating protein-protein interactions, which can lead to abnormal developmental processes contributing to CHD pathogenesis.Authors Summary Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a common condition with defects in heart development present from birth. CHD symptoms can range from mild to severe, often requiring early intervention or surgery. Over the years, numerous research studies have indicated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with CHD. However, the challenge arises from the fact that the majority of these variants are located within the noncoding portion of the genome, making it difficult to comprehend their mechanism of action. Here, we present a systematic computational pipeline to identify SNPs associated with CHD, in both protein-coding and noncoding regulatory elements – specifically, enhancers. Utilizing this pipeline, we established a collection of putative enhancers containing CHD-SNPs. Within these enhancers, several transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) related to heart developmental processes were identified. The presence of SNPs in these sites may potentially impact the binding of TFs necessary for the expression of genes targeted by these enhancers. Additionally, some of these enhancers were also found to be evolutionary conserved, suggesting their functional relevance. Concurrently, we identified coding variants which can alter the protein-protein interactions in a protein interaction network. Taken together, our study provided critical insights into the role of genetic variants in the pathological mechanism of complex human diseases, including CHD."

In the second stage, two research physiotherapists thoroughly reviewed and refined the questionnaire, and another physiotherapist conducted cognitive think-aloud interviews with 18 patients to assess the face and content validity of the questionnaire.Results All categories and corresponding activities of ICF core set for OA were used to develop the questionnaire. Several questionnaire issues were identified and addressed. Most challenges were related to comprehension, followed by item ordering and visual elements. Patients identified ambiguous wording which we subsequently simplified. Ten activities of the core set were excluded due to lack of face validity, two activities were added, and four activities were modified.Conclusion and implication The findings suggest that the ICF core set for OA needs to be adjusted for patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty and highlight the feasibility of applying a modified core set to assess functional priorities after hip or knee arthroplasty."

Modifying inpatient evening light exposure may be a low-intensity intervention for mental disorders, but few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exist. We report a large-scale pragmatic effectiveness RCT exploring whether individuals with acute psychiatric illnesses experience additional benefits from admission to an inpatient ward where changes in the evening light exposure are integrated into the therapeutic environment.Methods and findings All adults admitted for acute inpatient psychiatric care over eight months were randomly allocated to a ward with a blue-depleted evening light environment or a ward with standard light environment. Baseline and outcome data from individuals who provided deferred informed consent were used to analyze the primary outcome measure (differences in duration of hospitalization) and secondary measures (differences in key clinical outcomes). The Intent to Treat sample comprised 476 individuals (mean age 37; 41% were male). There were no differences in the mean duration of hospitalization (6.7 vs. 7.1 days). Inpatients exposed to the blue-depleted evening light showed higher improvement during admission (Clinical Global Impressions scale-Improvement: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.54; p=0.035, Number Needed to Treat for clinically meaningful improvement (NNT): 12); lower illness severity at discharge (Clinical Global Impressions Scale-Severity: –0.18, 95% CI: –0.34 to – 0.02; p=0.029, NNT for mild severity at discharge: 7); and lower levels of aggressive behaviour (Broset Violence Checklist difference in predicted serious events per 100 days: –2.98; 95% CI: –4.98 to –0.99; p=0.003, NNT: 9). Incidents of harm to self or others, side effects, and patient satisfaction did not differ between the lighting conditions.Conclusions Modifying the evening light environment in acute psychiatric hospitals according to chronobiological principles does not change duration of hospitalizations, but can have clinically significant benefits without increasing side effects, reducing patient satisfaction or requiring additional clinical staff."

Although numerous studies explore SV diversity across global populations and their potential impacts1–3, validation using model systems are needed to confirm the reported genotype-phenotype associations. Here, through long-read sequencing of 945 Han Chinese genomes, we identify 111,288 SVs, including 24.56% unreported variants, many predicted to be functionally important. Our analysis unveils the multifaceted origins of these SVs within the Han population, with approximately 24% emerging at the common ancestor of modern humans. By integrating human population-level phenotypic, metabolic, and immunologic data and two humanized mouse models, we demonstrate the causal roles of two SVs: one SV that emerges at the common ancestor of modern human and Neanderthal and Denisova in GSDMD for bone density and one modern-human-specific SV in WWP2 impacting height, weight, fat, craniofacial phenotypes, and innate immunity. Some of these phenotypes were previously unreported and irreproducible phenotypes in mouse knockout experiments. Our results suggest that the SV in GSDMD could serve as a rapid and cost-effective predictive biomarker for evaluating GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in multiple organ injuries, including cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. While initially identified in the Han, the functional conservation from human to mouse, signals of positive natural selection specifically in non-African populations including the Han, and associations with multiple disease risks, suggest that both SVs likely influence local adaptation, phenotypic diversity, and disease susceptibility across many non-African populations."

This mixed-methods study aimed to understand race-specific factors impacting acute pain experiences in Non-Hispanic White (NHW) and Black (NHB) children.Methods NHW and NHB children (aged 8-17) (n=19 each) with a recent acute pain experience, and their caregivers were recruited. The following domains were assessed in children (deprivation, ethnic identity, pain, psychosocial, pain coping, resilience) and caregivers (education, income, Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions Scale (REMS), Adverse Childhood Events (ACEs), Adult Response to Child’s Symptoms). Questionnaire measures were compared between groups using simple statistical tests. Fifteen dyads participated in focus groups. Thematic codes underlying pain experiences were identified.Results NHB children had similar pain/psychosocial characteristics but differed in ethnic identity (2.7 (0.5) vs. 2.2 (0.5); P=.002), deprivation index (0.4 (IQR 0.3-0.5) vs. 0.3 (IQR 0.2, 0.3), P=.007) and pain coping efficacy (8.6 (0.4) vs. 9.8 (0.5), P=.045) from NHW children. NHB caregivers scored higher on REMS sub-scales, ACEs (0 (0,1) vs 0 (0,0); P=.02) and Protection (1.9 (0.6) vs. 1.6 (0.5); P=.03) behaviors in response to child pain. NHB and NHW participants endorsed satisfaction with pain experiences, opioid avoidance, and stoicism. Unlike NHW participants, NHB reported barriers related to trust, discrimination, and access.Conclusions Racial differences in acute pain experiences suggest healthcare providers need to reinforce trust and consider underlying cultural and pain coping differences when treating pain in NHB children. Findings emphasize that family-centered and systems-based approaches are important for equity in pediatric pain.Article Summary This mixed-methods family-centered study identifies common themes, systems-related barriers and pain coping efficacy differences underlying pain experiences of Black and White children.What’s Known on This Subject Inequities exist in post-surgical pain and pain management of Black and White children.What This Study Adds Family perspectives regarding pain experience of NHB and NHW children highlight inter-group differences in stressors, barriers, pain coping and parent responses to child’s pain.

We implemented a seroepidemiological study in Isiolo County, Kenya, to determine relative seroprevalences of CCHFV in pastoralists, livestock and in wild animals’ species. In addition, we identified subject and environment level factors that influence exposure to CCHFV. Pastoralists (n = 580) and livestock (n = 2,137) were recruited into the study through a multistage random sampling technique, and addition, various species of wild animals (n = 87) were also sampled conveniently. Serum samples from all recruited subjects were collected and screened for CCHFV antibodies using ID.vet multispecies, double-antigen IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The overall anti-CCHFV IgG seroprevalences in pastoralists, cattle, goats, sheep and camels were 7.2% [95% CI: 3.1–15.8%], 53.9% [95% CI: 30.7–50.9%], 11.6% [95% CI: 7.2–22.5%], 8.6% [95% CI: 3–14%] and 89.7% [95% CI: 78–94%], respectively. On average, wild animals’ hosts had CCHFV seroprevalence of 41.0% [95% CI: 29.1–49.4%], and giraffes had the highest seroprevalence of 75.0% [95% CI: 63.2–79.3%]. Analysis using mixed effects logistic regression models showed that CCHFV exposure in pastoralists was significantly associated with male gender, being over 30 years and belonging to a household with a seropositive herd. In livestock, mature animals, high normalized difference vegetation indices and high vapour pressure deficit were significantly associated with CCHFV exposure. Age, sex and species of wild animals were considered as the risk factors in the analysis, but none of these variables was significant (P-value = 0.891, 0.401 and 0.664 respectively). A look at the risk factors suggests that the environmental factors such as the NDVI (P-value = 0.032) and the vapour pressure deficit (P-value = 0.004) significantly influences CCHFV exposure in livestock, while the presence of infected animals in a household significantly influences pastoralists exposure (P-value = 0.041). CCHF control in livestock, for example by applying acaricides, could minimize the risk of CCHFV exposure to pastoralists. The key findings of this study will guide policymakers in disease control, and emphasize the need for regular surveillance of zoonotic diseases for emergency preparedness, and also contributes to knowledge on One-Health approach for improved healthAuthor summary Our study focused on understanding the prevalence and risk factors associated with Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) among pastoralists, livestock, and wild animals in Isiolo County, Kenya. Through a comprehensive seroepidemiological investigation, we found varying seroprevalence rates across different species, with camels exhibiting the highest prevalence. Wild animals, notably giraffes, also displayed significant seroprevalence rates. Factors such as gender, age, and herd seropositivity were identified as significant contributors to CCHFV exposure among pastoralists, while environmental factors like vegetation indices and vapor pressure influenced livestock exposure.Our findings underscore the intricate interplay between human, animal, and environmental factors in CCHFV transmission dynamics. By elucidating these factors, we provide crucial insights for policymakers to develop targeted interventions and surveillance strategies, emphasizing the importance of a One-Health approach. Implementing control measures in livestock, such as acaricide application, could effectively mitigate CCHFV transmission to pastoralists. Overall, our study contributes to advancing knowledge in zoonotic disease control and underscores the necessity for proactive measures to enhance public health preparedness."

Lowering production of its parent protein, APP, has benefits in preclinical models. Posiphen binds to an iron-responsive element in APP mRNA and decreases translation of APP and Aβ. To augment human data for Posiphen, we evaluated safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects on Aβ metabolism using Stable Isotope Labeling Kinetic (SILK) analysis.Methods Double-blind phase 1b randomized ascending dose clinical trial, at five sites, under an IRB-approved protocol. Participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild AD (Early AD) with positive CSF biomarkers were randomized (within each dose arm) to Posiphen or placebo. Pretreatment assessment included lumbar puncture for CSF. Participants took Posiphen or placebo for 21-23 days, then underwent CSF catheter placement, intravenous infusion of 13C6-leucine, and CSF sampling for 36 hours. Safety and tolerability were assessed through participant reports, EKG and laboratory tests. CSF SILK analysis measured Aβ40, 38 and 42 with immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. Baseline and day 21 CSF APP, Aβ and other biomarkers were measured with immunoassays. The Mini-Mental State Exam and ADAS-cog12 were given at baseline and day 21.Results From June 2017 to December 2021, 19 participants were enrolled, in dose cohorts (6 active: 2 placebo) of 60 mg once/day and 60 mg twice/day; 1 participant was enrolled and completed 60 mg three times/day. 10 active drug and 5 placebo participants completed all study procedures. Posiphen was safe and well-tolerated. 8 participants had headaches related to CSF catheterization; 5 needed blood patches. Prespecified SILK analyses of Fractional Synthesis Rate (FSR) for CSF Aβ40 showed no significant overall or dose-dependent effects of Posiphen vs. placebo. Comprehensive multiparameter modeling of APP kinetics supported dose-dependent lowering of APP production by Posiphen. Cognitive measures and CSF biomarkers did not change significantly from baseline to 21 days in Posiphen vs placebo groups.Conclusions Posiphen was safe and well-tolerated in Early AD. A multicenter SILK study was feasible. Findings are limited by small sample size but provide additional supportive safety and PK data. Comprehensive modeling of biomarker dynamics using SILK data may reveal subtle drug effects.Trial registration NCT02925650 on clinicaltrials.gov"

This study evaluated six diagnostic tests designed to detect colistin-resistant pathogens.Methods PCR and broth microdilution assays (BMD) were used to respectively characterize the molecular mechanisms and phenotypic colistin resistance of 142 Gram-negative bacterial isolates and controls. The sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values, major (ME) and very major errors (VME), categorical and essential agreements (EA) of ComASP Colistin, CHROMagar COL-APSE, Rapid NP Test, Sensititre, MicroScan, and Vitek 2 were determined with these isolates; the BMD was used as gold standard.Results The Vitek 2, Sensititre, and ComASP tests were more efficient, albeit with concerning ME and VMEs and low EAs. Sensititre was 100% specific with 0% ME and 3.61% VME; Vitek 2 had the least VME (1.25% and 0%) and a low EA (57.50%). ComASP had an EA of 75.35%. MicroScan was highly sensitive (96.55%) but less specific (87.50%), with very below-accetable EAs (48.11%). The CHROMAgar COL-APSE efficiently identified the species with their unique colours but was the least specific (67.80%), with the highest ME (32.20%) and high VME (7.23%). The Rapid NP test had the highest VME (7.84%), producing results within 4 hours with 92.16% sensitivity and 96.08% specificity.Conclusion Vitek 2, MicroScan, ComASP colistin, and Sensititre are good for determining colistin resistance; the latter two tests are recommendable for low-resourced laboratories. The in-house Rapid NP test has short turnaround time with high efficiency for initial resistance screening."

A driver of this remodelling is platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) and its signalling via activation of the calcium ion channel, ORAI1. Here, we investigated if there are associations of ORAI1 polymorphisms with human cardiovascular disease.Methods and results We conducted candidate gene association analysis and revealed that a missense ORAI1 variant (rs3741596, S218G) associates with an increased risk of hospital-diagnosed peripheral vascular disease, generalised atherosclerosis, acute ischaemic heart disease, and atrioventricular and left bundle-branch block in White British UK Biobank participants. Rs3741596 is also associated with higher circulating platelet counts and reduced total triglyceride levels. Functional analysis of the effects of rs3741596 S218G variant on ORAI1 channel function, via introduction of the S218G ORAI1 variant in HEK293 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and investigation of its effects on SOCE, showed significantly enhanced SOCE compared to wild type cells, suggesting that the S218G variant enhances ORAI1 function.Conclusions Our results reveal an association between an ORAI1 missense variant and occlusive vascular diseases. These findings provide a novel insight into the role of ORAI1 in vascular remodelling and highlight its potential as a treatment target for vascular pathologies."

Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who undergo mechanical ventilation often experience serious illness and critical physiological states, contributing to a high risk of mortality. Prediction of mortality for mechanically ventilated ICU patients offers an early alert mechanism to help physicians implement more targeted treatments to mitigate the risk of mortality.Methods We extracted medical information of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation in ICU admission from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) dataset. This includes demographics, disease severity, diagnosis, and laboratory test results. Patients who met inclusion criteria were randomly divided into the train set (n=11,549, 70%), the test set (n=2,475, 15%), and the validation set (n=2,475, 15%). The oversampling method was utilized to resolve the imbalance dataset. After literature research, clinical expertise and ablation study, we selected 12 variables for model establishment, which were less than the 66 features in the best existing literature. We proposed a deep learning neural network model to predict the ICU mortality of mechanically ventilated patients, and established 7 baseline machine learning (ML) models for comparison, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, bagging, XGBoost, and support vector machine (SVM). Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) was used as an evaluation metric for model performance.Results By using 16,499 mechanically ventilated patients in the MIMIC III database, the deep learning model demonstrated the best performance, showing a 7.06% improvement over the best existing literature. The neural network achieved an AUROC score of 0.879 with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [0.861-0.896] and an accuracy score of 0.859 on the test set. These results far exceeded those of the best existing literature.Conclusions The proposed model demonstrated an exceptional ability to predict ICU mortality among mechanically ventilated patients. Through SHAP analysis, we found that respiratory failure is a significant indicator of the mortality prediction compared to other related respiratory dysfunction diseases. We also incorporated mechanical ventilation duration as a variable for the first time in our prediction model. We observed that patients with higher mortality rates tended to have longer mechanical ventilation times. This highlights the model’s potential in guiding clinical decisions by indicating that longer mechanical ventilation may not necessarily enhance patient survival chances."

To date, HCN2 variants have only been associated with mild epilepsy and recently, one monoallelic missense variant has been linked to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Here, we expand the phenotypic spectrum of HCN2-related disorders by describing twenty-one additional individuals from fifteen unrelated families carrying HCN2 variants. Seventeen individuals had developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID), two had borderline DD/ID, and one had borderline DD. Ten individuals had epilepsy with DD/ID, with median age of onset of 10 months, and one had epilepsy with normal development. Molecular diagnosis identified thirteen different pathogenic HCN2 variants, including eleven missense variants affecting highly conserved amino acids, one frameshift variant, and one in-frame deletion. Seven variants were monoallelic of which five occurred de novo, one was not maternally inherited, one was inherited from a father with mild learning disabilities, and one was of unknown inheritance. The remaining six variants were biallelic, with four homozygous and two compound heterozygous variants. Functional studies using two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings in Xenopus laevis oocytes were performed on three monoallelic variants, p.(Arg324His), p.(Ala363Val), and p.(Met374Leu), and three biallelic variants, p.(Leu377His), p.(Pro493Leu) and p.(Gly587Asp). The p.(Arg324His) variant induced a strong increase of HCN2 conductance, while p.(Ala363Val) and p.(Met374Leu) displayed dominant negative effects, leading to a partial loss of HCN2 channel function. By confocal imaging, we found that the p.(Leu377His), p.(Pro493Leu) and p.(Gly587Asp) pathogenic variants impaired membrane trafficking, resulting in a complete loss of HCN2 elicited currents in Xenopus oocytes. Structural 3D-analysis in depolarized and hyperpolarized states of HCN2 channels, revealed that the pathogenic variants p.(His205Gln), p.(Ser409Leu), p.(Arg324Cys), p.(Asn369Ser) and p.(Gly460Asp) modify molecular interactions altering HCN2 function. Taken together, our data broadens the clinical spectrum associated with HCN2 variants, and disclose that HCN2 is involved in developmental encephalopathy with or without epilepsy."

The extent to which cognitive symptoms and fatigue contribute to reduced quality of life in affected individuals remains clear.Methods This is a post-hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effect of vortioxetine on cognitive function in adults with PCC. The post-hoc analysis herein aimed to determine the overall effect of baseline cognitive function [as measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)] and baseline fatigue severity [as measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)] on baseline health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [as measured by the 5-item World Health Organisation Well-Being Index (WHO-5)].Results A total of 200 participants were enrolled in the primary trial. Due to missing baseline data, our statistical analysis included baseline measures of 147 individuals. Our generalized linear model analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between DSST-measured objective cognitive function and self-reported WHO-5-measured HRQoL (β = 0.069, 95% CI [0.006, 0.131], p = 0.032). In contrast, our analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between FSS and WHO-5 scores (β = -0.016, 95% CI [-0.021, –0.011], p < 0.001). The beta-coefficient ratio (βDSST / βFSS = 0.069 / 0.016) is calculated as 4.313.Conclusions Overall, we observed that increased cognitive function was associated with increased HRQoL at baseline in adults with PCC. Moreover, we observed that increased severity of fatigue symptoms was associated with decreased HRQoL at baseline in adults with PCC. Furthermore, we observed that an improvement in cognitive function would have a four-fold greater impact on HRQoL than the effect generated by improvement in fatigue."

However, the precise relationship and potential risk of HF events associated with insomnia and subtypes of symptoms necessitate further investigation.Objective This updated meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the associations between HF and various insomnia symptoms, including difficulty initiating sleep (DIS), difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS), early-morning awakening (EMA) and non-restorative sleep (NRS).Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify prospective cohort studies from inception to October 2023. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the correlation between insomnia and the risk of HF. Funnel plots and Egger’s tests were employed to assess publication bias.Results A total of 177,008 patients from seven eligible prospective cohort studies were included. The pooled minimally adjusted HR for HF was 1.26 (95% CI:1.09-1.45; P=0.001), indicating that insomnia was associated with increased risk of HF. Among the individual insomnia symptoms, only DIS showed a positive association with risk of HF (HR:1.14, 95% CI:1.04-1.25; P=0.005). DMS and NRS had no significant effect on the risk of HF (P>0.05). In the subgroup analysis including age, sex and BMI, there were no significant differences between each group.Conclusion This meta-analysis confirms the link between insomnia and an increased risk of HF, particularly highlighting the importance of DIS as a potential predictor for HF.Clinical Perspective What is new?Insomnia is ubiquitous and seriously affects people’s normal work, life, and health. At present, prospective cohort studies have suggested that insomnia can increase the risk of heart failure (HF). However, in our meta-analysis, we firstly found that only Difficulty Initiating Sleep (DIS) was directly associated with an increased HF incidence, rather than other insomnia subtypes. This is a very interesting which suggests that DIS has a greater impact on the incident of HF. In addition, this points us that in the subsequent treatment of insomnia, maybe we should pay more attention to the treatment of DIS.What are the clinical implications?As insomnia symptoms can be assessed and identified early and are relatively manageable, the study of the relationship between insomnia and HF has potential important clinical significance. If further research confirms that the improvement of insomnia symptoms, especially DIS symptoms, contributes to the prevention of HF or the prognosis of HF patients, it will provide another new “track” for the prevention and treatment of HF."

Furthermore, we introduced a machine learning-based metric, Language Informativeness Index (LII), to quantify informativeness.RESULTS Indicators of AD in English were found to be highly predictive of AD in Persian, with a 92.3% classification accuracy. Additionally, we found robust correlations between the typical linguistic abnormalities of AD and language emptiness (low LII) across both languages.DISCUSSION Findings suggest AD linguistics impairments are attributed to a core universal difficulty in generating informative messages. Our approach underscores the importance of incorporating biocultural diversity into research, fostering the development of inclusive diagnostic tools."

Individuals of Mexican descent living in South Texas have increased prevalence of comorbid T2D and early onset AD, despite low incidence of the predisposing APOE-e4 variant and an absence of the phenotype among relatives residing in Mexico – suggesting a role for environmental factors in coincident T2D and AD susceptibility. Here, in a small clinical trial, we show dysbiosis of the human gut microbiome could contribute to neuroinflammation and risk for AD in this population. Divergent Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) responses, despite no differences in expressed dietary preferences, provided the first evidence for altered gut microbial ecology among T2D subjects (sT2D) versus population-matched healthy controls (HC). Metataxonomic 16S rRNA sequencing of participant stool revealed a decrease in alpha diversity of sT2D versus HC gut communities and identified BMI as a driver of gut community structure. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) identified a significant decrease in the relative abundance of the short-chain fatty acid-producing taxa Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibacterium, and Alistipes and an increase in pathobionts Escherichia-Shigella, Enterobacter, and Clostridia innocuum among sT2D gut microbiota, as well as differentially abundant gene and metabolic pathways. These results suggest characterization of the gut microbiome of individuals with T2D could identify key actors among “disease state” microbiota which may increase risk for or accelerate the onset of neurodegeneration. Furthermore, they identify candidate microbiome-targeted approaches for prevention and treatment of neuroinflammation in AD."

This study aims to understand the behavior of parents on self medicating their children with antibiotics.Methods A cross-sectional study was done in the community under UHTC of IGIMS, Patna among 173 parents having children <12 years of age for a period of 12 months. Participants were selected through simple random sampling and were interviewed using a questionnaire developed by the authors. Data were compared using logistic regression and presented with odd ratios and confidence intervals.Result Prevalence of self medication was 31.8% in this study. Higher prevalence was seen among mothers, parents between 30-39 years, graduates (p = 0.001), having family income 20000-40000, housewives and those who do not have Ayushman card. Mothers, parents ≥40 years, having Secondary/ Higher secondary education, not having Ayushman card and those having child’s age of 7-9 years normally stop giving antibiotics when their child start feeling better. Whereas postgraduates parents (p = 0.000) and participants having family member in medical field were seen keeping antibiotic stock at home for later use. 39.9% parents could identify antibiotics correctly. Majority of the parents wait for 1-2 days before starting antibiotic. Most common reason for self medication was minor illness followed by previous experience with similar symptoms.Conclusion Lack of essential knowledge about medicines among parents is a serious matter particularly when children are concerned. Interventions targeted at improving awareness about antibiotic misuse, resistance and adverse effects amongst parents involved in self-medication need to be implemented on large scale."

Despite this, until recently relatively little attention has been paid to their physical health trajectories. There is now emerging longitudinal evidence to suggest an association between specific NDCs in childhood or adolescence and certain physical long-term conditions (LTCs) in adulthood. However, to date this literature has never been comprehensively appraised. As a result, our understanding of all the future health risks that young people with NDCs may collectively be at risk of is limited and the factors which drive these adult health outcomes also remain obscure.Methods A search strategy has been developed in collaboration with two medical librarians and will be used to conduct systematic searches of Medline, Embase, APA PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science. Prospective longitudinal studies exploring the association between three common NDCs in childhood or adolescence (i.e., ADHD, Autism, and Tic Disorders <18 years of age) and any physical LTC in adulthood (i.e., > 18 years of age) will be selected through title and abstract review, followed by a full-text review. Data extracted will include definition of exposure and outcome, mediators or moderators investigated, confounders adjusted for, and crude and adjusted effect estimates. Risk of bias assessment will be conducted. Results will be synthesized narratively and if the data allow, a meta-analysis will also be conducted.Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not applicable for this study since no original data will be collected. The results of the review will be widely disseminated locally, nationally, and internationally through peer-reviewed publication, adhering to the PRISMA statement, and conference presentations.Strengths and Limitations of This StudyTo our knowledge, this is the first systematic review synthesising and critically assessing evidence from longitudinal, observational studies on the association between NDCs in childhood or adolescence and physical long-term conditions (LTCs) in adulthood.We will conduct a comprehensive search across multiple databases, without publication restrictions and will adhere to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) recommendations to ensure methodological rigor.This study’s focus on prospective longitudinal evidence from observational studies will strengthen the conclusions drawn from results and may facilitate causal inference across studies.Depending on its findings, this study may represent a healthier sample of people with NDCs due to studies with significant loss to follow-up.We plan to meta-analyse outcome data; however due to possible heterogeneity between studies this may not be appropriate."

FO was defined as a positive fluid balance ≥7% of admission body weight within 72 hours of ICU admission. After reviewing medication administration record (MAR) data in three-hour periods, IV medication exposure was categorized into clusters using principal component analysis (PCA) and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). Medication regimens of patients with and without FO were compared within clusters to assess for temporal clusters associated with FO using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Exploratory analyses of the medication cluster most associated with FO for medications frequently appearing and used in the first 24 hours was conducted.RESULTS FO occurred in 127/927 (13.7%) of the patients enrolled. Patients received a median (IQR) of 31 (13-65) discrete IV medication administrations over the 72-hour period. Across all 47,803 IV medication administrations, ten unique IV medication clusters were identified with 121-130 medications in each cluster. Among the ten clusters, cluster 7 had the greatest association with FO; the mean number of cluster 7 medications received was significantly greater in patients in the FO cohort compared to patients who did not experience FO (25.6 vs.10.9. p<0.0001). 51 of the 127 medications in cluster 7 (40.2%) appeared in > 5 separate 3-hour periods during the 72-hour study window. The most common cluster 7 medications included continuous infusions, antibiotics, and sedatives/analgesics. Addition of cluster 7 medications to a prediction model with APACHE II score and receipt of diuretics improved the ability for the model to predict fluid overload (AUROC 5.65, p =0.0004).CONCLUSIONS Using ML approaches, a unique IV medication cluster was strongly associated with FO. Incorporation of this cluster improved the ability to predict development of fluid overload in ICU patients compared with traditional prediction models. This method may be further developed into real-time clinical applications to improve early detection of adverse outcomes.Questions Can machine learning detect the presence of time-dependent medication administration patterns that are associated with risk of fluid overload in critically ill patients?Findings Using unsupervised machine learning, a unique IV medication cluster was identified that, when combined with the APACHE II score and diuretic use, improved the ability to predict fluid overload in ICU patients.Meaning These findings suggest that machine learning may be an important tool for analyzing IV mediation administration patterns to predict development of fluid overload. Such models may provide insight into areas where medication administration practices could be optimized to mitigate the risk of fluid overload in this patient population."

However, limited information exists regarding the feasibility and influencing factors of such integration. This study investigates potential barriers and facilitators to integrate TB, DM, and TC programs in Ambegaon Block of Pune District in Maharashtra and Ballabgarh Block of Faridabad District in Haryana states of India.Methods Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted between Nov 2022 to March 2023 among health workers, program managers, and stakeholders involved in program implementation (n=32). Interview guide was based on World Health Organization’s Health System Strengthening framework. Purposive sampling and snowball sampling were used to select participants. Rapid analysis of the data was done using the WHO HSS Framework.Results There were barriers and facilitators for the integration of TB-DM-TC programs observed in India. The primary challenges for integration are at the level of service delivery which is largely attributed to inadequate implementation of all three programs and negligible involvement of private practitioners in the program implementation. Moreover, inadequate referral system, insufficient infrastructure, limited resources, a shortage of trained staff, and lack of essential drugs and equipment impeded the uptake and coverage of services.Conclusion The results highlight the critical importance of addressing barriers and facilitators of implementation program in India to build a robust structure of managing the triple burden of TB, DM and tobacco control. The proposed strategies, such as sensitizing health system staff, implementing feedback and referral systems, and developing cross-program digital platforms offer a roadmap for policymakers and healthcare system managers. A multidimensional approach is vital for overcoming barriers and facilitating integration."

There are limited information about the adequate Antenatal Care (ANC) services coverage, therefore this study aimed at examining the proportion of ANC services coverage, distribution pattern and its associated factors obtained by women of reproductive age (WRA) in Tanzania.Methods This was analytical cross-sectional study among women of reproductive age in Tanzania, utilizing data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) 2022. Analysis considered the complex survey design through application of weights, clustering and strata. Modified Poisson regression models estimated the factors associated with adequate reception of ANC services among WRA in Tanzania. All analyses were performed in STATA software version 18.Results The proportion of WRA who had received adequate ANC component coverage was 41%. Distribution of ANC contents ranged from 0.5% to 41% for none to seven services respectively. Almost all women (96.1%) had their baby’s heartbeat checked. Various factors such as education, wealth index, age, residence, number of ANC visits and birth order were significantly associated with uptake of ANC services among WRA in Tanzania.Conclusion The overall findings suggest a notable disparity in the utilization of ANC services, as fewer than half of women of reproductive age (WRA) are receiving sufficient ANC coverage. Therefore, integrated approaches involving health care facilities and communities, innovative strategies targeting young adults, and strengthening the policy of four or more ANC visits with regular monitoring and data collection are recommended to improve ANC access, utilization, and alignment with WHO guidelines."

Although diffusion biomarkers from the ventral and dorsal streams have demonstrated strong predictive power for language outcomes, it is still unclear how these biomarkers relate to the various stages of PSA recovery. In this study, we aim to compare diffusion metrics and language measures as predictors of language recovery in a longitudinal cohort of participants with PSA.Methods Twenty-four participants (mean age = 73 years, 8 women) presenting PSA were recruited in an acute stroke unit. Participants underwent diffusion MRI scanning and language assessment within 3 days (acute phase) after stroke, with a behavioral follow-up at subacute (10±3 days) and chronic phases (> 6 months). We used regression analyses on language performance (cross-sectional) and Δscores at subacute and chronic timepoints (difference between acute and subacute, and subacute and chronic respectively), with language baseline scores, diffusion metrics from language-related white matter tracts, lesion size and demographic predictors.Results Best prediction model of performance scores used axial diffusivity (AD) from the left arcuate fasciculus (AF) in both subacute (R2 = 0.785) and chronic timepoints (R2 = 0.626). Moreover, prediction of change scores depended on AD from left inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), in subacute stage (R2 = 0.5), and depended additionally on AD from right IFOF in the chronic stages (R2 = 0.68). Mediation analyses showed that lesion load of left AF mediated the relationship between AD from left AF and chronic language performance.Conclusion Language performance in subacute and chronic timepoints depends on the integrity of left AF, whereas Δscores of subacute and chronic phases depends on left IFOF, showing a dissociation of the white matter pathways regarding language outcomes. These results support the hypothesis of a functional differentiation of the dual-stream components in PSA recovery."

The mixed results in the literature may be due to differences in participants’ brain lesions, sensorimotor tasks, or a combination of both.Objective We first sought to better understand the overall impact of stroke on motor adaptation and then delineated the impact of lesion hemisphere and sensorimotor task on adaptation poststroke.Methods Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 studies comparing individuals poststroke to neurotypical controls, with each group consisting of over 200 participants.Results We found that stroke impairs motor adaptation (d = −0.64; 95% CI [−1.06, −0.22]), and that the extent of this impairment did not differ across sensorimotor tasks but may vary with the lesioned hemisphere. Specifically, we observed greater evidence for impaired adaptation in individuals with left hemisphere lesions compared to those with right hemisphere lesions.Conclusions This review not only clarifies the detrimental effect of stroke on motor adaptation but also underscores the need for finer-grained studies to determine precisely how various sensorimotor learning mechanisms are impacted. The current findings may guide future mechanistic and applied research at the intersection of motor learning and neurorehabilitation."

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging can identify cardiac scar, which may improve diagnostic accuracy and prognostication.Objectives To define the incidence of long-term LGE post COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis (C-VAM) and to establish the additive role of CMR in the diagnostic work-up.Methods Patients with Brighton Collaboration Criteria Level 1 (definite) or Level 2 (probable) C-VAM were prospectively recruited from the Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination In the Community (SAEFVIC) database to undergo CMR at least 12 months after diagnosis. As there were limited patients with access to baseline CMR, prior CMR results were not included in the initial case definition. The presence of LGE on follow-up CMR was then integrated into the diagnostic algorithm and the reclassification rate (definite vs. probable) was calculated.Results Sixty-seven patients with C-VAM (mean age 30 ± 13 years, 72% male) underwent CMR evaluation. Median time from vaccination to CMR was 548 (range 398-603) days. Twenty patients (30%) had persistent LGE, most frequently found in the basal inferolateral segment (n = 11). At diagnosis, nine patients (13%) were classified as definite and 58 (87%) as probable myocarditis. With integration of CMR LGE data, 16 patients (28%) were reclassified from probable to definite myocarditis.Conclusion Persistent LGE on CMR occurs in one third of patients with C-VAM. Without CMR at diagnosis, almost one third of patients are misclassified as probable rather than definite myocarditis."

Individuals of both sexes aged 15 to 50 years were included. Patients with positive tests for VVS, OH, or POTS, and those with negative results were excluded. As a healthy group, healthy volunteers without a personal history of syncope or presyncope and with a negative tilt-table test were included.Statistical Analysis Categorical variables were expressed as percentages and quantitative variables as mean ± standard deviation. Repeated measures ANOVA, the χ2 test, and effect size using Glass’s Δ were used for group comparisons. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The R software, RStudio, and the effsize package were used for analysis.Results The main finding was a significant decrease in cerebral blood flow secondary to an increase in cerebral vascular resistance in patients from a supine position at the start and throughout the test, compared to the control group.Conclusion The analysis of cerebral hemodynamics allows for the identification of a subpopulation of patients who exhibit decreased cerebral blood flow from a supine position during the tilt-table test while maintaining cardiovascular stability without progressing to syncope."

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is regarded as a safe and effective treatment for severe and chronic depressive episodes, even when other interventions such as psychotherapy or psychopharmacology have failed. Despite its superior efficacy, use of ECT for depressed patients is surprisingly low in most European countries as exemplified in a recent Dutch study. This low application rate is possibly due to (1) limited knowledge on the optimal position of ECT in the treatment algorithms, (2) a lack of knowledge on cost-effectiveness, (3) fear for (cognitive) side-effects in patients, relatives and professionals, and (4) the outdated representation of ECT in the media and society at large.Methods The present study will overcome the aforementioned limitations and setup a large database of merged clinical and research cohorts of ECT-patients (N=±1500) and an observational prospective cohort study, in order to analyze aspects of (cost-) effectiveness and side-effects of ECT in retro- and prospective Dutch data. Using these results and together with qualitative information from patients and their relatives, we will disseminate the gained knowledge and develop with a decision-making tool that will guide future patients and their family members referred for ECT.Discussion Our project will further clarify the position of ECT in treatment algorithms for depression based on scientific data, including data on cost-effectiveness, cognitive side-effects and needs of the patients in the decision-making process. By these means, it will contribute to the development of successful personalized treatment and preventive strategies also in other countries in cooperation with stakeholders such as national and international commissions."

This study aimed to assess how well the simplified Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score could predict the death of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Vietnam.Methods From July 30 to October 15, 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional study on critically ill COVID-19 adult patients at an intensive care centre in Vietnam. We calculated the areas under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC) to determine how well the simplified RALE score could predict hospital mortality. In a frontal CXR, the simplified RALE score assigns a score to each lung, ranging from 0 to 4. The overall severity score is the sum of points from both lungs, with a maximum possible score of 8. We also utilized ROC curve analysis to find the best cut-off value for this score. Finally, we utilized logistic regression to identify the association of simplified RALE score with hospital mortality.Results Of 105 patients, 40.0% were men, the median age was 61.0 years (Q1-Q3: 52.0-71.0), and 79.0% of patients died in the hospital. Most patients exhibited bilateral lung opacities on their admission CXRs (99.0%; 100/102), with the highest occurrence of opacity distribution spanning three (18.3%; 19/104) to four quadrants of the lungs (74.0%; 77/104) and a high median simplified RALE score of 8.0 (Q1-Q3: 6.0-8.0). The simplified RALE score (AUROC: 0.747 [95% CI: 0.617-0.877]; cut-off value ≥5.5; sensitivity: 93.9%; specificity: 45.5%; PAUROC <0.001) demonstrated a good discriminatory ability in predicting hospital mortality. After adjusting for confounding factors such as age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index, serum interleukin-6 level upon admission, and admission severity scoring systems, the simplified RALE score of ≥5.5 (adjusted OR: 18.437; 95% CI: 3.215-105.741; p =0.001) was independently associated with an increased risk of hospital mortality.Conclusions This study focused on a highly selected cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients with a high simplified RALE score and a high mortality rate. Beyond its good discriminatory ability in predicting hospital mortality, the simplified RALE score also emerged as an independent predictor of hospital mortality."

If zero-shot VQA can be applied to a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), a prevalent diagnostic tool in the medical field, the potential benefits to the field would be substantial. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of zero-shot VQA with multimodal LLMs on 12-lead ECG images. The results revealed that multimodal LLM tended to make more errors in extracting and verbalizing image features than in describing preconditions and making logical inferences. Even when the answers were correct, erroneous descriptions of image features were common. These findings suggest a need for improved control over image hallucination and indicate that performance evaluation using the percentage of correct answers to multiple-choice questions may not be sufficient for performance assessment in VQA tasks."

Non-genetic factors which influence HMO composition in breastfeeding mothers in rural Africa have not been investigated.Objective We undertook a cross-sectional study to determine the association between HMO profiles and non-genetic maternal factors and children’s sex in Ugandan mother-children pairs.Method Human milk was collected from 127 breastfeeding mothers by manual expression. HMO analysis was by high performance liquid chromatography. The proportion of each HMO per total HMO concentration was calculated. Spearman’s correlation and Mann-Whitney U test were used to assess the relationship between individual HMOs and maternal factors and infant sex.Result Nineteen HMOs were assayed. The prevalence of secretor and non-secretor status, based on the proportion of mothers with high milk concentrations of 2’FL and LNFP 1, was 80.3 % and 19.7 %, respectively. In secretor mothers, 2’FL, DFLac and LNFP I constituted > 57 % while in non-secretor mothers LNT and LNFPII constituted 46.9 % of the measured total HMOs. The median 3’SL concentration in milk of all mothers of male children was significantly higher than that in all mothers of female children. The median DFLac concentration in all mothers was significantly higher in multiparous mothers compared to primiparous mothers. Higher FDSLNH and lower LNH concentrations were observed in overweight secretor and non-secretor mothers, respectively. Median concentrations of LNFP I and DSLNT were significantly higher in all mothers < 18 years old compared all mothers > 18 years old. Concentrations of specific HMOs increased, decreased, or remained unchanged with increasing lactation duration in secretor and non-secretor mothers.Conclusions Specific HMOs were associated with infant sex and maternal age, parity and post-partum BMI in Ugandan mothers but were different from those reported in other populations."

We assessed the surface expression of a specific T Cell Receptor β-chain constant region using conjugated anti-JOV1.1 monoclonal antibodies to identify clonal T cell populations in a large diagnostic flow cytometry laboratory within a quaternary referral hospital. 37 cases were analysed. We identified 15 cases of clonal JOVI.1 expression, 7 of which had a consensus diagnosis of T-cell lymphoproliferative disease (TLPD). The remaining 22 cases had polyclonal JOVI.1 expression, none of which had a consensus diagnosis of TLPD, resulting in a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 73%. When clonal NK-T cells were excluded, specificity further improves to 97%. These results provide real-world data and support the widespread adoption of this assay into diagnostic use."

We conducted this study to evaluate the performance of T1 mapping parameters for detection of cardiac amyloidosis (CA) in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and their prognostic values in patients with AL-CA, using a semi-automated deep learning algorithm.Methods and Results A total of 300 patients who underwent CMR for differential diagnosis of LVH were analyzed. CA was confirmed in 50 patients (39 with AL-CA and 11 with transthyretin amyloidosis), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 198, hypertensive heart disease in 47, and Fabry disease in 5. A semi-automated deep learning algorithm (Myomics-Q) was used for the analysis of the CMR images. The optimal cutoff extracellular volume fraction (ECV) for the differentiation of CA from other etiologies was 33.6% (diagnostic accuracy 85.6%). he artificial intelligence (AI)-derived ECV showed a significant prognostic value for a composite of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization in patients with AL-CA (revised Mayo stage III or IV) (adjusted hazard ratio 4.247 for ECV ≥40%, 95% confidence interval 1.215–14.851, p-value=0.024). Incorporation of AI-derived ECV into the revised Mayo staging system resulted in better risk stratification (integrated discrimination index 27.9%, p=0.013; net reclassification index 13.8%, p=0.007).Conclusions AI-assisted T1 mapping on CMR imaging allows for improved diagnosis of CA from other etiologies of LVH. Furthermore, AI-derived ECV has significant prognostic value in patients with AL-CA, suggesting its clinical usefulness.Download figureOpen in new tab"

There is a notable shift in the trend towards integration methods that specifically target the simultaneous analysis of multiple modes or types of data, showcasing superior results compared to individual analyses. Despite the availability of diverse ML architectures for researchers interested in embracing a multimodal approach, the current literature lacks a comprehensive taxonomy that includes the pros and cons of these methods to guide the entire process. Closing this gap is imperative, necessitating the creation of a robust framework. This framework should not only categorise the diverse ML architectures suitable for multimodal analysis but also offer insights into their respective advantages and limitations. Additionally, such a framework can act as a guide for selecting an appropriate workflow for multimodal analysis. This comprehensive taxonomy would furnish a clear guidance and aid in informed decision-making within the progressively intricate realm of biomedical and clinical data analysis, and is imperative for advancing personalised medicine.Objective The aims of the work are to comprehensively study and describe the harmonisation processes that are performed and reported in the literature and present a working guide that would enable planning and selecting an appropriate integrative model.Methods A systematic review of publications that report the multimodal harmonisation of biomedical and clinical data has been performed.Results We present harmonisation as a dual process of representation and integration, each with multiple methods and categories. The taxonomy of the various representation and integration methods are classified into six broad categories and detailed with the advantages, disadvantages and examples. A guide flowchart that describes the step-by-step processes that are needed to adopt a multimodal approach is also presented along with examples and references.Conclusions This review provides a thorough taxonomy of methods for harmonising multimodal data and introduces a foundational 10-step guide for newcomers to implement a multimodal workflow."

We intended to investigate and pool the evidence on the prognostic utility of admission MPV in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with CAD.Methods PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were the major databases used for literature search. The risk of bias was assessed using the quality in prognostic factor studies. We used random-effects pairwise analysis with the Knapp and Hartung approach supported further with permutation tests and prediction intervals (PIs).Results We identified 52 studies with 47066 patients. A meta-analysis of 9 studies with 14,864 patients demonstrated that 1 femtoliter increase in MPV values was associated with a rise of 29% in the risk of long-term mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-1.37) in CAD as a whole. The results were further supported with PIs, permutation tests and leave-one-out sensitivity analyses. MPV also demonstrated its stable and significant prognostic utility in predicting long-term mortality as a linear variable in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.20-1.39, and 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.39, respectively).Conclusion The meta-analysis found robust evidence on the link between admission MPV and the increased risk of long-term mortality in patients with CAD patients, as well as in patients who underwent PCI and patients presented with ACS.PROSPERO number CRD42023495287"

The high cost of bladder cancer treatment stems from its high recurrence rate, which necessitates frequent surveillance. White light cystoscopy (WLC), the standard of care surveillance tool to examine the bladder for lesions, has limited sensitivity for early-stage bladder cancer. Blue light cystoscopy (BLC) utilizes a fluorescent dye to induce contrast in cancerous regions, improving the sensitivity of detection by 43%. Nevertheless, the added cost and lengthy administration time of the dye limits the availability of BLC for surveillance. Here, we report the first demonstration of digital staining on clinical endoscopy videos collected with standard-of-care clinical equipment to convert WLC images to accurate BLC-like images. We introduce key pre-processing steps to circumvent color and brightness variations in clinical datasets needed for successful model performance; the results show excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement of the digitally stained WLC (dsWLC) images with ground truth BLC images as measured through staining accuracy analysis and color consistency assessment. In short, dsWLC can provide the fluorescent contrast needed to improve the detection sensitivity of bladder cancer, thereby increasing the accessibility of BLC contrast for bladder cancer surveillance use without the cost and time burden associated with the dye and specialized equipment."

Currently, the heterogeneity of sepsis makes it challenging to determine the molecular mechanisms that define the syndrome. Here, we leverage population scale proteomics to analyze a well-defined cohort of 1364 blood samples taken at time-of-admission to the emergency department from patients suspected of sepsis. We identified panels of proteins using explainable artificial intelligence that predict clinical outcomes and applied these panels to reduce high-dimensional proteomics data to a low-dimensional interpretable latent space (ILS). Using the ILS, we constructed an adaptive digital twin model that accurately predicted organ dysfunction, mortality, and early-mortality-risk patients using only data available at time-of-admission. In addition to being highly effective for investigating sepsis, this approach supports the flexible incorporation of new data and can generalize to other diseases to aid in translational research and the development of precision medicine."

Addition of durvalumab to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) has previously been shown to improve survival outcomes. Meanwhile, subgroups harboring KRAS mutations have been shown to have worse prognosis. We investigated whether KRAS mutational status may affect survival outcomes after adjuvant durvalumab following cCRT in stage III NSCLC.Methods In this retrospective study, we present a real-world dataset of all stage III NSCLC patients treated with cCRT with a curative intent and molecularly assessed between 2016-2021 in West Sweden. Primary study outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS).Results We identified 145 patients receiving cCRT with a curative intent, 32% harbored an activating mutation in the KRAS gene (KRASMUT). Compared to KRAS wild-type (KRASWT), KRASMUT had a worse OS (p=0.047) and PFS (p=0.038). The finding persisted on multivariate analysis with OS (HR 1.703, 95%CI 1.074-2.702, p = 0.024) and PFS (HR 1.628, 95% CI 1.081-2.453, p = 0.020). After the addition of durvalumab to cCRT, there were no longer any significant differences between KRASWT and KRASMUT in OS or PFS.Conclusions KRAS mutations are a negative prognostic factor after cCRT in stage III NSCLC, and the addition of durvalumab equalizes the negative impact of harboring this mutation."

Inclusion criteria for this review were classified using the “PCC” mnemonic: Population-Pregnant women and mothers; Concept-Policies and strategies that supports prenatal and maternal health; and Context-Relevant to Scotland and Georgia. Published primary and secondary research, and grey literature (guidelines, reports, and legislation from authoritative sources) were included.Results Overall, 60 sources contributed to the report on maternal health system topics. Findings of the textual synthesis presented a regionalized system of maternity care led by physician-provided care models in Georgia compared to the nationalized health system in Scotland with an extended scope for midwife-led care models. On a secondary, organizational level, Scotland also widely operates on protocolized, standardized care informed by clinical guidelines such as NICE. The Georgia health systems also follow national guidelines for care, but extent of standardization may vary based on a mixed system of private and public insurance coverage.Discussion/Conclusion This is the first study to comprehensively examine maternal health policies in the distinct contexts of Georgia and Scotland, shedding light on the diverse approaches within their respective healthcare systems. These observed variations stem from historical, cultural, and policy contexts unique to each region. As the United States continue to prioritize maternal and child health through public health initiatives, our findings feature crucial considerations for maternal antenatal care policies. Specifically, there is a discernible need to increase access to antenatal care and invest in the maternity care provider workforce, revealing opportunities for targeted improvements in support of maternal health."

We investigated the types of variation in the LPA gene and their predictive performance on LP(a) concentration. We determined the Kringle IV-type 2 (KIV-2) copy number (CN) using the DRAGEN LPA Caller (DLC) and a read-depth based CN estimator in 8351 whole genome sequencing samples from the GENESIS-HD study. The pentanucleotide repeat in the promoter region was genotyped with GangSTR and ExpansionHunter. LP(a) concentration was available in 4861 population-based subjects. Predictive performance on LP(a) concentration was investigated using random forests. The agreement of the KIV-2 CN between the two specialized callers was high (r=0.9966; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9965–0.9968). Allele-specific KIV-2 CN could be determined in 47.0% of the subjects using the DLC. Lp(a) concentration can be better predicted from allele-specific KIV-2 CN than total KIV-2 CN. Two single nucleotide variants 4925G>A and rs41272114 further improved prediction. The genetically complex LPA gene can be analyzed with excellent agreement between different callers. The allele-specific KIV-2 CN is more important for predicting LP(a) concentration than the total KIV-2 CN. It would be important that the allele-specific KIV-2 CN is determinable in all subjects.

The present study aims to utilize large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the contextual argument quality of triples in SemMedDB to improve the understanding of disease mechanisms. Using argument mining methods, we first design a quality evaluation framework across four major dimensions, triples’ accuracy, triple-sentence correlation, research object, and evidence cogency, to evaluate the argument quality of the triple-based claim according to their contextual sentences. Then we choose a sample of 66 triple-sentence pairs for repeated annotations and framework optimization. As a result, the predicted performances of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are excellent with an accuracy up to 0.90 in the complex cogency evaluation task. The tentative case evaluating whether there exists an association between gestational diabetes and periodontitis reveals accurate predictions (GPT-4, accuracy, 0.88). LLMs-enabled argument quality evaluation is promising for evidence integration in understanding disease mechanisms, especially how evidence in two stances with varying levels of cogency evolves over time."

Here we developed and clinically validated a largely automated metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay for agnostic detection of respiratory viral pathogens from nasopharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheal aspirate samples in <24 hours. The mNGS assay achieved mean limits of detection of 543 copies/mL, viral load quantification with 100% linearity, and 93.6% sensitivity, 93.8% specificity, and 93.7% accuracy compared to gold-standard clinical multiplex RT-PCR. Performance increased to 97.9% overall predictive agreement after discrepancy testing and clinical adjudication, which was superior to that of RT-PCR (95.0% agreement). To enable discovery of novel, sequence-divergent human viruses with pandemic potential, de novo assembly and translated nucleotide algorithms were incorporated into the automated SURPI+ computational pipeline used by the mNGS assay for pathogen detection. Using in silico analysis, we showed after removal of all human viral sequences from the reference database that 70 (100%) of 70 representative human viral pathogens could still be identified based on homology to related animal or plant viruses. Our assay, which was granted breakthrough device designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August of 2023, demonstrates the feasibility of routine mNGS testing in clinical and public health laboratories, thus enabling a robust and rapid response to the next viral respiratory pandemic."

Individuals suffering from PTSD are at increased risk of cardiovascu-lar disease (CVD), but it is unclear why. This study assesses shared genetic liability and potential causal pathways between PTSD and CVD.Methods We leveraged summary-level data of genome-wide association studies (PTSD: N= 1,222,882; atrial fibril-lation (AF): N=482,409; coronary artery disease (CAD): N=1,165,690; hypertension: N=458,554; heart failure (HF): N=977,323). First, we estimated genetic correlations and utilized genomic structural equation modeling to identify a common genetic factor for PTSD and CVD. Next, we assessed biological, behavioural, and psychosocial factors as potential mediators. Finally, we employed multivariable Mendelian randomiza-tion to examine causal pathways between PTSD and CVD, incorporating the same potential mediators.Results Significant genetic correlations were found between PTSD and CAD, HT, and HF (rg =0.21-0.32, p≤ 3.08 · 10*16), but not between PTSD and AF. Insomnia, smoking, alcohol dependence, waist-to-hip ratio, and inflammation (IL6, C-reactive protein) partly mediated these associations. Mendelian randomization indicated that PTSD causally increases CAD (IVW OR=1.53, 95% CIs=1.19-1.96, p=0.001), HF (OR=1.44, CIs=1.08-1.92, p=0.012), and to a lesser degree hypertension (OR=1.25, CIs=1.05-1.49, p=0.012). While insomnia, smoking, alcohol, and inflammation were important mediators, independent causal effects also remained.Conclusions In addition to shared genetic liability between PTSD and CVD, we present strong evidence for causal effects of PTSD on CVD. Crucially, we implicate specific lifestyle and biological mediators (insomnia, substance use, inflammation) which has important implications for interventions to prevent CVD in PTSD patients.Translational perspective The significant mental and physical strain experienced by patients suffering from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains a domain necessitating further insight for the development of effective intervention strategies. Our study elucidates the complex genetic architecture that underlies the relationship between PTSD and cardiovascular disease. We present evidence supporting a causal link from PTSD to coronary artery disease and heart failure. Further, we identify various mediators of this causality, including inflammatory markers, substance use, waist-to-hip ratio and sleep deprivation. Our work calls for tar-geted preventive and therapeutic approaches to reduce the dual burden of mental and physical disease in PTSD patients."

We propose the GREAT care paradigm (Genomic Informed Care for Motivating High Risk Individuals Eligible for Evidence-based Prevention), which employs polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to stratify disease risk and personalize interventions, such as lung cancer screening and tobacco treatment. We developed PRSs using large-scale multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies and adjusted for genetic ancestry for standardized risk stratification across diverse populations. We applied our PRSs to over 340,000 individuals of diverse ethnic background and found significant odds ratios for lung cancer and difficulty quitting smoking. These findings enable the evaluation of PRS-based interventions in ongoing trials aimed at motivating health behavior changes in high-risk patients. This pioneering approach enhances primary care with genomic insights, promising improved outcomes in cancer prevention and tobacco treatment, and is currently under assessment in clinical trials."

However, the majority of injuries are coded in International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and lack this severity information. A system to predict injury severity classifications from ICD codes would be beneficial as manually coding in AIS can be time-intensive or even impossible for some retrospective cases. It has been previously shown that the encoder-decoder-based neural machine translation (NMT) model is more accurate than a one-to-one mapping of ICD codes to AIS. The objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of two architectures, feedforward neural networks (FFNN) and NMT, in predicting Injury Severity Score (ISS) and ISS ≥16 classification. Both architectures were tested in direct conversion from ICD codes to ISS score and indirect conversion through AIS for a total of four models. Trauma cases from the U.S. National Trauma Data Bank were used to develop and test the four models as the injuries were coded in both ICD and AIS. 2,031,793 trauma cases from 2017-2018 were used to train and validate the models while 1,091,792 cases from 2019 were used to test and compare them. The results showed that indirect conversion through AIS using an NMT was the most accurate in predicting the exact ISS score, followed by direct conversion with FFNN, direct conversion with NMT, and lastly indirect conversion with FFNN, with statistically significant differences in performance on all pairwise comparisons. The rankings were similar when comparing the accuracy of predicting ISS ≥16 classification, however the differences were smaller. The NMT architecture continues to demonstrate notable accuracy in predicting exact ISS scores, but a simpler FFNN approach may be preferred in specific situations, such as if only ISS ≥16 classification is needed or large-scale computational resources are unavailable."

However, there are more observable biomechanical compensation strategies within TUG that are indicative of underlying neuromuscular issues and movement priorities. In individuals with unilateral knee osteoarthritis, an increased trunk flexion during TUG is a common phenomenon, often attributed to muscle weakness and/or pain avoidance. Unfortunately, it is difficult to differentiate between these underlying causes using experimental studies alone. This study aimed to distinguish between muscle weakness and pain avoidance as contributing factors, using predictive neuromuscular simulations of the sit-to-walk movement. Muscle weakness was simulated by reducing the maximum isometric force of the vasti muscles (ranging from 20% to 60%), while pain avoidance was integrated as a movement objective, ensuring that peak knee load did not exceed predefined thresholds (2-4 times body weight). The simulations demonstrate that a decrease in muscular capacity led to greater trunk flexion, while pain avoidance led to slower movement speeds and altered muscle recruitments, but not to greater trunk flexion. Our predictive simulations thus indicate that increased trunk flexion is more likely the result of lack of muscular reserve rather than pain avoidance. These findings align with reported differences in kinematics and muscle activations between moderate and severe knee osteoarthritis patients, emphasizing the impact of severe muscle weakness in those with advanced knee osteoarthritis. The simulations offer valuable insights into the mechanisms behind altered movement strategies, potentially guiding more targeted treatment."

Here, by applying multiomic single cell analysis to duodenal biopsies, we find low-grade malignancies with lymphoma driver mutations in refractory CD type 2 (RCD2) patients comprise surface CD3 negative (sCD3-) lymphocytes stalled at an innate lymphoid cell (ILC) - progenitor T cell stage undergoing extensive TCR recombination. In people with refractory CD type 1 (RCD1), who currently lack explanation, we discover sCD3+ T cells with lymphoma driver mutations forming large clones displaying inflammatory and cytotoxic molecular profiles in 6 of 10 individuals, and a single small clone in 1 of 4 active recently diagnosed CD cases. Accumulation of driver-mutated T cells and their sCD3-progenitors may explain chronic, non-responsive autoimmunity.One-Sentence Summary Treatment refractory autoimmunity in celiac disease may be explained by dysregulated T cells and progenitors that have acquired lymphoma-driver mutations."

The outcomes assessed were the lipid metabolism indicators, including TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C, as well as the safety of the treatment.Data extraction and synthesis Data extraction and quality evaluation were conducted by two independent reviewers, with any discrepancies discussed by a third researcher. Pooled mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each outcome. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were carried out to explore the heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot. The quality of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE system.Results The final meta-analysis included nine eligible studies involving 754 patients. When comparing statin group, the acupuncture plus statin group showed lower levels of TC (MD=-0.48, 95% CI: −0.61 to −0.35, P<0.00001), TG (MD=-0.59, 95% CI: −0.86 to −0.32, P<0.00001), LDL-C (MD=-0.66, 95% CI: −0.99 to −0.33, P=0.0001), and higher levels of HDL-C (MD=0.16, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.26, P=0.001). Each study included in the analysis exhibited some degree of bias. Significant publication bias was detected for the primary outcomes. Evidence quality for the primary outcomes was graded as very low.Conclusions Acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment can further improve lipid profile in individuals diagnosed with AP of CHD based on statin therapy.

However, difficulties persist in precisely locating the PCN needle tip during its insertion into the kidney. Challenges for PCN needle guidance exist in two aspects: 1) Accurate tissue recognition, and 2) Renal blood vessel detection. In this study, we demonstrated an endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) system for PCN needle guidance. Human kidney samples are utilized in the experiments. Different renal tissues including: 1) cortex, 2) medulla, 3) calyx, 4) fat, and 5) pelvis can be clearly distinguished based on their OCT imaging features. We conduct kidney perfusion experiments to mimic the renal blood flow. Our system can efficiently detect the blood flow in front of PCN needle using Doppler OCT function. To improve surgical guidance efficiency and alleviate the workload of radiologists, we employ convolutional neural network (CNN) methods to automate the procedure. Three CNN models including ResNet50, InceptionV3, and Xception were applied for tissue classification. All of them demonstrate promising prediction results, with InceptionV3 achieving the highest recognition accuracy of 99.6%. For automatic blood vessel detection, nnU-net was applied, and it exhibited intersection over unions (IoU) values of 0.8917 for blood vessel and 0.9916 for background."

We quantified the relationship between OAC adherence and AF clinical outcomes using methods not previously applied to this problem.Methods Retrospective observational cohort study of incident cases of AF from population-based administrative data over 23 years. The exposure of interest was proportion of days covered (PDC) during 90 days before an event or end of follow-up. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate time to first SSE and the composite of SSE, TIA, or death, and several secondary outcomes.Results 44,172 patients were included with median follow-up of 6.7 years. For DOACs, each 10% decrease in adherence was associated with a 14% increased hazard of SSE and 5% increased hazard of SSE, TIA, or death. For VKA the corresponding increase in SSE hazard was 3%. Receiving DOAC or VKA was associated with primary outcome hazard reduction across most the PDC spectrum. Differences between VKA and DOAC were statistically significant for all efficacy outcomes and at most adherence levels.Conclusions Even small reductions in OAC adherence in patients with AF were associated with significant increases in risk of stroke, with greater magnitudes for DOAC than VKA. DOAC recipients may be more vulnerable than VKA recipients to increased risk of stroke and death even with small reductions in adherence. The worsening efficacy outcomes associated with decreasing adherence occurred without the benefit of major bleeding reduction."

Here, we investigate the prognostic value of combining survival data on KRAS mutation status and tumor size in early-stage NSCLC.Methods We studied the combined impact of KRAS mutational status and tumor size on overall survival (OS) and risk of death in patients with stage I-II NSCLC. We performed a retrospective study including 310 consecutively diagnosed patients with early (stage I-II) NSCLCs. All consecutive patients molecularly assessed and diagnosed between 2016-2018 with stage I-II NSCLC in the Västra Götaland region of western Sweden were included in this multi-center retrospective study. The primary study outcome was OS and risk of death (hazard ratio).Results Out of 310 patients with stage I-II NSCLC, 37% harbored an activating mutation in the KRAS gene. Our study confirmed staging and tumor size as prognostic factors. However, KRAS mutational status was not found to impact OS and there was no difference in the risk of death when combining KRAS mutational status and primary tumor size.Conclusions In our patient cohort, KRAS mutations in combination with primary tumor size are not associated with a worse prognosis in stage I-II NSCLC."

The high TNBC prevalence (>25%) in India remains a challenge in clinical management. Association of germline BRCA1/2 mutations in TNBCs is well-established as a predisposing factor for hereditary breast cancer risk. These studies are however predominantly representative of western population. Therefore, we investigated germline profiles of multi-institutional cohort of TNBC patients in IndiaMethods Using a multi-gene NGS (next-generation sequencing) panel of 26 ACMG recommended genes associated with inherited cancers.Results In our study cohort of 193 TNBC patients, we identified 57 pathogenic mutations of which BRCA1 (71.93%) and BRCA2 (14.03%) were most commonly mutated. Additionally, 8 pathogenic mutations were identified in non-BRCA genes associated with the HR pathway. 10 novel mutations were identified in 3 genes namely BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2. Comparison of allele-frequency with the global databases like TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), gnomAD and Genome Asia 100K indicated that the novel mutations were unique. Furthermore, we identified 48 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) (24.9%).Conclusions Our study confirms the major proportion of mutations in BRCA1/2 genes in TNBCs in India. Interestingly, a higher proportion of VUS were found in the non-BRCA genes compared to BRCA1/2 emphasizing the need for functional studies of the non-BRCA genes. Additionally, large scale studies are also warranted to elucidate the landscape of germline mutations relevant to the Indian population and their probable clinical implications."

The chatbot was tested with ten open-ended questions per image, covering examination identification, lesion detection, diagnosis, and decision support. The responses were manually assessed for accuracy, usability, safety, and diagnosis repeatablity. Auto-evaluation was performed using sentence similarity and GPT-4-based auto-evaluation.Results Out of 600 responses, 30.6% were accurate, 21.5% were highly usable, and 55.6% were deemed as no harm. GPT-4V performed best with slit-lamp images, with 42.0%, 38.5%, and 68.5% of the responses being accurate, highly usable, and no harm, respectively. However, its performance was weaker in FPP images, with only 13.7%, 3.7%, and 38.5% in the same categories. GPT-4V correctly identified 95.6% of the imaging modalities and showed varying accuracy in lesion identification (25.6%), diagnosis (16.1%), and decision support (24.0%). The overall repeatability of GPT-4V in diagnosing ocular images was 63% (38/60). The overall sentence similarity between responses generated by GPT-4V and human answers is 55.5%, with Spearman correlations of 0.569 for accuracy and 0.576 for usability.Conclusion GPT-4V currently lacks the reliability needed for clinical decision-making in ophthalmology. Our study serve as a benchmark for enhancing ophthalmic multimodal models.Synopsis Only 30.6%, 21.5%, and 55.6% responses about ocular multimodal images generated by GPT-4V(ision) were considered accurate, highly usable, no harm, respectively. Currently, GPT-4V lacks the reliability required for clinical decision-making and patient consultation in ophthalmology.What is already known on this topic: First, GPT-4V(ision) exhibited significant advantages in fine-grained world-knowledge-intensive visual question answering. Second, the performance of GPT-4V in the multimodal medical diagnosis domain had been evaluated through case analysis, involving 17 medical systems and 8 modalities used in clinical practice. However, ophthalmic-related images were not included in the study.What this study adds:Being the first known evaluation of GPT-4V’s capabilities in processing ophthalmic multimodal images, our study adds valuable insights to the existing body of knowledge. Our study highlight the incapabilities of GPT-4V, demonstrating that it currently lacks the essential reliability required for clinical decision-making and patient consultation in ophthalmology.How this study might affect research, practice or policy: The evidence gathered in this study show that continued refinement and testing remain crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models in medical applications. This work provides a benchmark for further investigation in building large language models for processing ophthalmic multimodal images."

We previously discovered that variants in NOS1AP, encoding nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) adaptor protein, cause monogenic nephrotic syndrome (NS). Here, we determined that an intergenic splice product of NOS1AP/Nos1ap and neighboring C1orf226/Gm7694, which precludes NOS1 binding, is the predominant isoform in mammalian kidney transcriptional and proteomic data. Gm7694-/- mice, whose allele exclusively disrupts the intergenic product, developed NS phenotypes. In two human NS subjects, we identified causative NOS1AP splice variants, including one predicted to abrogate intergenic splicing but initially misclassified as benign based on the canonical transcript. Finally, by modifying genetic background, we generated a faithful mouse model of NOS1AP-associated NS, which responded to anti-proteinuric treatment. This study highlights the importance of intergenic splicing and a potential treatment avenue in a mendelian disorder."

Without treatment, death is the norm. Prognostic models can steer important management decisions by identifying patients at high-risk of adverse outcomes. We therefore aim to identify, summarise, and appraise the available prognostic models predicting clinical outcomes in VL patients.Methods We reviewed all published studies that developed, validated, or updated models predicting clinical outcomes in VL patients. Five bibliographic databases were searched from database inception to March 1st 2023 with no language restriction. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate. Findings are presented with tables, figures, and a narrative review.Results Eight studies, published 2003-21, were identified describing 12 model developments and 19 external validations. All models predicted either in-hospital mortality (n=10 models) or registry-reported mortality (n=2), and were developed in either Brazilian or East African settings (n=9 and n=3 models respectively). Model discrimination (c-statistic) ranged from 0.62-0.92 when evaluated in new data (19 external validations, 10 models). Risk of bias was high for all model developments and validations: no studies presented calibration plots, 11 models were at high risk of overfitting due to small sample sizes, and six models presented risk scores that were inconsistent with reported regression coefficients.Conclusion With a high risk of bias identified for all models, caution must be exercised when interpreting model predictions and performance measures. Prior to model development or validation, we encourage investigators to review model reporting guidelines. No prognostic models were identified predicting treatment failure or relapse. Furthermore, despite South Asia representing the highest VL burden pre-2010, no models were developed in this population. In the context of the current South Asia elimination programme, these represent important evidence gaps where new model development should be prioritised.Registration details A protocol for this systematic review has been published (1) and registered (PROSPERO ID: CRD42023417226).What is already known on this topic
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease associated with high mortality, and endemic to regions with constrained resources.Identification of high-risk patients is important when prioritising the allocation of limited resources, including inpatient beds, certain VL treatments, and follow-up clinic capacity.Risk stratification of VL patients can be performed using prognostic models, however, the range of models, and important model characteristics, have yet to be systematically evaluated.What this study adds
Following reporting guidelines for systematic reviews of prediction model studies, we present the first comprehensive review of prognostic models that predict clinical outcomes in VL patients.We describe 12 prognostic models that all predict mortality in Brazil or East Africa.All identified models, including model validations, are assessed at high risk of bias – model predictions and performance measures should be interpreted with caution.How this study might affect research, practice or policy
This review allows investigators to assess important evidence gaps in the VL prediction model landscape, and identify candidate models for validation or updating using their own patient data.Models are identified, summarised, and appraised so that policymakers and healthcare providers can assess model applicability to their own patient population.By highlighting limitations in the interpretation of model predictions and performance measures, and to address common sources of bias, we encourage investigators interested in prediction model research to review current guidelines in model reporting, including recently published tools for the calculation of sample sizes and model presentation."

We investigated pathways to TB pre-elimination and elimination (incidence <1.0 and <0.1 per 100,000, respectively) in the United States.Methods Using a mathematical modelling framework, we simulated how U.S. TB incidence could be affected by changes in TB services in the countries of origin for future migrants to the United States, as well as changes in TB services inside the United States. We constructed intervention scenarios representing improvements in TB services internationally and within the United States, individually and in combination, plus a base-case scenario representing continuation of current services. We simulated health and economic outcomes until 2100.Findings Under the base-case, U.S. TB incidence rates were projected to decline to 1.8 (95% uncertainty interval: 1.5, 2.1) per 100,000 by 2050. Intervention scenarios produced substantial reductions in TB incidence, with the combination of all domestic and international interventions projected to achieve pre-elimination by 2033 (2031, 2037). Compared to the base-case, this combination could avert 101 (84, 120) thousand U.S. TB cases and 13 (11, 16) thousand U.S. TB deaths over 2025-2050; the total economic value of these TB incidence reductions was estimated as US$68 (33, 112) billion. TB elimination was not projected before 2100.Interpretation Strengthening TB services domestically, promoting the development of more effective technologies and interventions, and supporting TB programs in high-burden countries are key strategies for accelerating progress towards TB elimination in the United States.Funding U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Evidence before this study A number of studies have investigated the potential health impacts of tuberculosis intervention options in individual countries, across high incidence and low incidence settings. Studies in high incidence settings have generally emphasized TB case detection as a high-impact strategy, while studies in low incidence settings have focused on preventive treatment among individuals with TB infection. Few studies have examined the combined effect of interventions choices in both high- and low-incidence settings, and how these choices can contribute to progress towards TB elimination goals in individual countries.Added value of this study Using a mathematical modelling approach, this study assessed how interventions in high burden countries and interventions used within the United States could affect future TB trends within the United States. Dependencies between different TB epidemics were modelled explicitly through migration. The analysis examined the extent to which different intervention combinations could accelerate progress towards TB pre-elimination and elimination goals (incidence <1.0 and <0.1 per 100,000, respectively).Implications of all the available evidence In this low-burden setting, actions to strengthen TB services domestically, promote the development of more effective technologies and interventions, and support TB programs in high-burden countries were all found to be complementary and impactful strategies for accelerating progress towards TB elimination."

Despite their transformative impact on natural language processing, public LLMs present notable vulnerabilities given the source of training data is often web-based or crowdsourced, and hence can be manipulated by perpetrators. We delve into the vulnerabilities of clinical LLMs, particularly BioGPT which is trained on publicly available biomedical literature and clinical notes from MIMIC-III, in the realm of data poisoning attacks. Exploring susceptibility to data poisoning-based attacks on de-identified breast cancer clinical notes, our approach is the first one to assess the extent of such attacks and our findings reveal successful manipulation of LLM outputs. Through this work, we emphasize on the urgency of comprehending these vulnerabilities in LLMs, and encourage the mindful and responsible usage of LLMs in the clinical domain."

Total-contact casts are widely used as the most effective external technique for off-loading plantar ulcers. This study compared the effectiveness of PRP and normal saline dressings in conjunction with TCC.Methods 36 patients with diabetic foot ulcers were divided into two groups using computer generated randomization into PRP and NS groups with 18 patients in each group. The PRP group was given autologous PRP, and the NS group was given wet dressing with NS, following which TCC was applied in each case for off-loading. Follow-up was performed every 15 days for 90 days. In each follow-up measurement and TCC application, the time to heal and PUSH score was used to measure the condition of the wound.Results In the PRP group, the mean wound size 8.28±1.18 and the mean Push tool total 13.44±0.98 at base line which gradually decreased, and finally, on day 90, it was reduced to 0.61±1.20 and 1.89±3.68, respectively. In NS group the mean wound size 8.45±1.13 and mean Push tool total 13.50±0.92 at baseline which was gradually decreased and finally at day 90 it was reduced to 1.58±1.55 and 4.61±4.37 respectively. A significant difference was observed in both groups during the final evaluation. Compared with the NS group, the PRP group showed greater improvement.Conclusion Both autologous PRP and NS are effective in treating DFU, when used along with TCC. However, PRP therapy is better at reducing the healing time and hospital visits."

Identifying 73 deletion and 89 duplication carriers among unrelated white British UK Biobank participants, we performed a phenome-wide association study between the region’s copy number and 117 complex traits and diseases, mimicking four dosage models. Forty-six phenotypes (39%) were affected by 16p11.2 BP4-5 CNVs, with the deletion-only, mirror, U-shape, and duplication-only models being the best fit for thirty, ten, four, and two phenotypes, respectively, aligning with the stronger deleteriousness of the deletion. Upon individually adjusting CNV effects for either body mass index (BMI), height, cognitive function, or socio-economic status as potential mediators, we found that sixteen testable deletion-driven associations (61%) – primarily with cardiovascular and metabolic traits – were BMI-dependent, with other mediators playing a more subtle role. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization supported that 13 out of these 16 associations (81%) were secondary consequences of the CNV’s impact on BMI. For the 22 traits that remained significantly associated upon individual adjustment for mediators, matched-control analyses found that eleven phenotypes, including musculoskeletal traits, liver enzymes, fluid intelligence, platelet count, pulmonary capacity, pneumonia, and acute kidney injury, remained associated under strict Bonferroni correction, with eight additional nominally significant associations. These results paint a complex picture of 16p11.2 BP4-5’s pleiotropic pattern that involves direct effects on multiple physiological systems and indirect co-morbidities consequential to the CNV’s impact on BMI and cognition, acting through trait-specific dosage mechanisms."

Perceived knowledge and determinants of mpox were assessed via a self-reported questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed.Results A total of 394 participants took part in the study. With respect to the socio-demographic characteristic of the study population, 356 (89.4%) were Cameroonians, 267 (67.1%) were females, and 261 (65.60%) were students. With regards to mpox knowledge, 278 (69.8%) of the respondents declared that mpox is caused by a virus, with 12 (3.0%) individuals responding that the signs and symptoms associated with mpox were back and/or muscle pain, skin rash, fever, pustules, and exhaustion. Knowledge scores were found to be dependent on socio-demographic background. Based on socio-behavioral determinants of mpox, 348 (87.4%) of the participants reported consumption of wild game (bushmeat) and 92 (23.1%) participants reported that mpox can be treated traditionally in their culture. Regarding epidemiological determinants, 42 (10.6%) participants reported that mpox can be transmitted through direct contact with lesions, 120 (30.2%) reported prior smallpox infection, and 47(11.8%) reported prior mpox infection. Based on risk factors reported, 180 (46.7%) of the participants had close contact with confirmed or probable cases of mpox and 196 (49.2%) were present in healthcare facilities where mpox cases were managed.Conclusion Multiple knowledge gaps regarding mpox and MPXV were documented in the population in Southwest and Littoral regions of Cameroon. Reported social and behavioral determinants included the state of instability of the southwest region and population displacement in the bushes/forests, wild game consumption without proper cooking and poor hygiene were associated with mpox infection risk perception and vulnerability. On the epidemiological aspects increased instability, travel out of town, and limited remote rural chickenpox vaccination coverage were reported to increase risk, vulnerability, and spread of mpox within these endemic communities."

One of the challenges in optimising diabetes care is translating research advances in this heterogenous disease into routine clinical care. A potential solution is the introduction of precision medicine approaches into diabetes care.We aim to develop a digital platform called ‘intelligent Diabetes’ (iDiabetes) to support a precision diabetes care model in Scotland and assess its impact on the primary composite outcome of all-cause mortality, hospitalisation rate, renal function decline and glycaemic control.Methods and Analysis The impact of iDiabetes will be evaluated through a cluster-randomised controlled study, recruiting up to 22,500 patients with diabetes. Primary care general practices (GP) in the National Health Service Scotland Tayside Health Board are the units (clusters) of randomisation. Each primary care GP will form one cluster (approximately 400 patients per cluster), with up to 60 clusters recruited. Randomisation will be to iDiabetes (guideline support), iDiabetesPlus or usual diabetes care (control arm). Patients of participating primary care GPs are automatically enrolled to the study when they attend for their annual diabetes screening or are newly diagnosed with diabetes. A composite hierarchical primary outcome, evaluated using Win-Ratio statistical methodology, will consists of (I) all-cause mortality, (II) all-cause hospitalisation rate, (III) proportion with >40% eGFR reduction from baseline or new development of end-stage renal disease, (IV) proportion with absolute HbA1C reduction >0.5%. Comprehensive qualitative and health economic analyses will be conducted, assessing the cost-effectiveness, budget impact and user acceptability of the iDiabetes platform.Ethics and Dissemination This study was reviewed by the NHS HRA and given a favourable opinion by a Research Ethics Committee (reference:23/ES/0008). Study findings will be disseminated via publications and presented at scientific conferences. Findings will be shared with patients and the public on the study website and social media.Study registration ISRCTN18000901Study Sponsor University of Dundee, no. 2-026-22.

Qualitative data were obtained from semi-structured interviews after the implementation period.Results Patients (n=30) played the VR game during either their medically necessary pin-pulling or needlestick procedures within three clinical environments. Children ranged from 5-16 years and were 50% male. The majority of patients reported enjoyment (mean 8.2 out of 10) with the VR during the procedure and only one minor technical issue was reported. Qualitative data collection showed the benefits of using VR included its ease of use, decreased observed anxiety, and patients had an easier time getting through the medical procedures.Conclusion Clinician feedback from the dissemination of VR into pediatric clinical environments showed promising results. Standardized guidelines are needed to further implement VR pain alleviation as standard care in clinical settings.Implications for patient care VR is easy to implement in clinic settings and can improve pediatric patient care during painful medical procedures. Utilizing nurses as champions for novel clinical techniques can assist with transitioning from research to the standard of care.Impact The project provided evidence for broader expansion and implementation of VR into different clinical areas. If VR is implemented into daily clinical practice, patients could benefit from reduced pain and anxiety, and medical procedures could be performed more easily than without adjunctive pain/anxiety management.Reporting Method This project adhered to the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) checklist.Patient or Public Contribution No Patient or Public ContributionWhat does this paper contribute to the wider global clinical community?Medical providers (including nurses) were able to effectively implement VR for pain and anxiety distraction without extending procedure time.Nurses are excellent champions for implementing novel techniques for patient care.Trial and Protocol Registration There is no trial and protocol registration for this project.

Public health measures to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted services and increased patient delays for colonoscopy services in Quebec. The differential impact of these interruptions by colonoscopy indication is largely unknown.Methods Using 2018–2022 retrospective clinical data from two high-volume Montreal endoscopy centres and provincial administrative data, we characterized changes in colonoscopy wait times and the proportion of waitlisted patients who were delayed (wait time exceeded provincial guidelines) by procedure indication and demographics. We used regression to examine patient characteristics associated with delayed procedures during pre– and intra-COVID-19 periods. We used time series analysis to characterize trends in the proportion of waitlisted patients delayed.Results The COVID-19-related public health measures resulted in record-high delays (median increase in wait times of 34-159% across indications). While older patients experienced longer wait times pre-pandemic, intra-COVID-19 wait times increased disproportionately for patients younger than 50. The proportion of waitlisted patients delayed peaked mid-2020 (56.9% for screening; 56.0% for symptom assessment patients). By early 2022, the proportion delayed had fallen to 37.3% for screening patients but remained at 53.8% for symptom assessment patients.Conclusions In Quebec, intra-COVID-19 colonoscopy delays disproportionately impacted symptom assessment procedures and younger patients.

However, the accuracy, stability and prompt strategies associated with LLMs in extracting complex medical information have not been adequately investigated. Our study assessed the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 in extracting or summarizing seven crucial medical information items from the title and abstract of research papers. We also validated the impact of prompt engineering strategies and the effectiveness of evaluating metrics.Methodology We adopted a stratified sampling method to select 100 papers from the teaching schools and departments in the LKS Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, published between 2015 and 2023. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 were instructed to extract seven pieces of information, including study design, sample size, data source, patient, intervention, comparison, and outcomes. The experiment incorporated three prompt engineering strategies: persona, chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting. We employed three metrics to assess the alignment between the GPT output and the ground truth: BERTScore, ROUGE-1 and a self-developed GPT-4.0 evaluator. Finally, we evaluated and compared the proportion of correct answers among different GPT versions and prompt engineering strategies.Results GPT demonstrated robust capabilities in accurately extracting medical information from titles and abstracts. The average accuracy of GPT-4.0, when paired with the optimal prompt engineering strategy, ranged from 0.688 to 0.964 among the seven items, with sample size achieving the highest score and intervention yielding the lowest. GPT version was shown to be a statistically significant factor in model performance, but prompt engineering strategies did not exhibit cumulative effects on model performance. Additionally, our results showed that the GPT-4.0 evaluator outperformed the ROUGE-1 and BERTScore in assessing the alignment of information (Accuracy: GPT-4.0 Evaluator: 0.9714, ROUGE-1: 0.9429, BERTScore: 0.8714).Conclusion Our result confirms the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting medical information, suggesting their potential as efficient tools for literature review. We recommend utilizing an advanced version of LLMs to enhance the model performance, while prompt engineering strategies should be tailored to the specific tasks. Additionally, LLMs show promise as an evaluation tool to assess the model performance related to complex information processing."

While telemedicine is not the panacea for the increasing health care burden, it can alleviate the problem. Here, the hypothetical impact of delivering telehealth care to patients in a busy tertiary cardio-vascular clinic in Istanbul, Turkey, is examined. Additionally, the potential environmental and societal ramifications of telemedicine are also examined.Demographics, health care costs, wages, productivity, and patient-specific data were exploited to develop a hypothetical telemedicine framework for the Turkish health care landscape. Specifically, the distance traveled and travel time to receive care using real-life location of the clinics and patients addresses seeking care are tabulated.Data from August 3, 2015 to January 25, 2023 resulted in 45,602 unique encounters with 448 unique diagnoses recorded for the patient encounters. The patients in the top 5% of the most common diagnoses traveled 23.82 ± 96.3 km to reach the clinics. Based on our model and the related literature that telehealth care for chronic diseases is not inferior to face-to-face care, 656,258 km would have been saved if all patients were to take the first visit in person followed by telemedicine visits. The travel-associated carbon footprint and wage losses for in-person care in lieu of telehealth appointments is calculated and it was observed that exploiting telemedicine could have saved approximately 30% carbon footprint and prevented approximately $878,000 wage loss. As a result, it is found that application of telemedicine could ease the burden on patients, environment, increase access, and prevent the wage losses caused by unnecessary hospital visits."

The extent of correlation has mechanistic and clinical implications.Methods This post-hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial contains baseline data of subjective and objective measures of cognition in a rigorously characterized cohort living with PCC. Herein, we evaluated the association between subjective and objective condition function, as measured by the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire, 20-item (PDQ-20) and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Trails Making Test (TMT)-A/B, respectively.Results A total of 152 participants comprised the baseline sample. Due to missing data, our statistical analyses included 150 for self-reported PDQ-20, 147 individuals for combined DSST-measured cognitive function (composite z-score of the Pen/Paper plus Online CogState Version, NcombinedDSST), 71 for in-person DSST-measured cognitive function (Pen/Paper Version), 70 for TMT-A-measured cognitive function, and 70 for TMT-B-measured cognitive function. After adjusting for age, sex, and education, PDQ-20 was significantly correlated with pen-and-paper DSST (β = -0.003, p = 0.002) and TMT-B (β = 0.003, p = 0.008) scores, but not with TMT-A scores (β = -0.001, p = 0.751).Conclusions Overall, a statistically significant correlation was observed between subjective and objective cognitive functions. Clinicians providing care for individuals with PCC who have subjective cognitive function complaints may consider taking a measurement-based approach to cognition at the point of care that focuses exclusively on patient-reported measures."

While pre-surgical histopathological examination is ideal, it’s not always possible. CT radiomic analysis shows promise to predict NSCLC histological subtypes.Objective To use CT scan radiomic analysis from NSCLC-Radiomics data to predict NSCLC histological subtypes using machine learning and deep learning models.Methods 422 CT scans from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) were analyzed. Primary neoplasms were segmented by expert radiologists. Using PyRadiomics, 2446 radiomic features were extracted; post-selection, 179 features remained. Machine learning models like logistic regression, SVM, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, alongside a deep neural network (DNN) model.Results Random forest demonstrated the highest accuracy at 78% (95% CI: 70%-84%) and AUC-ROC at 94% (95% CI: 90%-96%). LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost had AUC-ROC values of 95%, 93%, and 93% respectively. The DNN’s AUC was 94.4% (95% CI: 94.1% to 94.6%). Logistic regression had the least efficacy. For histological subtype prediction, random forest, boosting models, and DNN were superior.Conclusions Quantitative radiomic analysis with machine learning can accurately determine NSCLC histological subtypes. Random forest, ensemble models, and DNNs show significant promise for pre-operative NSCLC classification, which can streamline therapy decisions."

Variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number (mtDNAcn), a key mitochondrial change associated with chronic stress, is an emerging biomarker for disease pathology and progression. mtDNAcn can be quantified from whole blood samples using qPCR to determine the ratio of nuclear DNA to mtDNA. However, the collection of blood samples in pediatric populations, particularly in infants and young children, can be technically challenging, yield much smaller volume samples, and can be distressing for the patients and their caregivers. Therefore, we have validated a mtDNAcn assay utilizing DNA from simple buccal swabs (Isohelix SK-2S) and report here it’s performance in specimens from infants (age = <12 months). Utilizing qPCR to amplify ∼200bp regions from two mitochondrial (ND1, ND6) and two nuclear (BECN1, NEB) genes, we demonstrated absolute (100%) concordance with results from low-pass whole genome sequencing (lpWGS). We believe that this method overcomes key obstacles to measuring mtDNAcn in pediatric populations and creates the possibility for development of clinical assays to measure mitochondrial change during pathophysiological stress."

Access to multimodal HDCD provides a unique opportunity for genetic studies of complex traits because different modalities relevant to a single physiological system (e.g., circulatory system) encode complementary and overlapping information. We propose a novel multimodal deep learning method, M-REGLE, for discovering genetic associations from a joint representation of multiple complementary HDCD modalities. We showcase the effectiveness of this model by applying it to several cardiovascular modalities. M-REGLE jointly learns a lower representation (i.e., latent factors) of multimodal HDCD using a convolutional variational autoencoder, performs genome wide association studies (GWAS) on each latent factor, then combines the results to study the genetics of the underlying system. To validate the advantages of M-REGLE and multimodal learning, we apply it to common cardiovascular modalities (PPG and ECG), and compare its results to unimodal learning methods in which representations are learned from each data modality separately, but the downstream genetic analyses are performed on the combined unimodal representations. M-REGLE identifies 19.3% more loci on the 12-lead ECG dataset, 13.0% more loci on the ECG lead I + PPG dataset, and its genetic risk score significantly outperforms the unimodal risk score at predicting cardiac phenotypes, such as atrial fibrillation (Afib), in multiple biobanks."

This study delves into the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke care, by examining evidence of shifts in healthcare utilization, the enduring effects on post-stroke recovery, and the overall quality of life experienced by stroke survivors.Methods A scoping review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology for Scoping Reviews. The search strategy encompassed electronic databases (APA PsycInfo, Embase, Medline, and CINAHL). English language articles published between December 2019 and January 2022 were included, focusing on individuals who experienced a stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data extraction involved identifying study characteristics and significant findings, facilitating a qualitative and narrative synthesis of the gathered evidence.Results Seven domain summaries were identified. They all described the aspects of systemic transformations in stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) patient behavior and awareness; (2) telemedicine and remote care; (3) delays in treatment; (4) impact on healthcare resources; (5) quality of care; (6) changes in stroke severity; and (7) reduction in stroke admissions.Conclusions This study underscored the critical need to encourage swift patient response to acute stroke symptoms, by finding new avenues for treatment, mitigating hospital-related infection fears, and advocating for the establishment of centralized stroke centers. These measures are integral to optimizing stroke care delivery and ensuring timely interventions, particularly in the challenging context of a pandemic."

Data for the observational study were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011–2018. The relationship between exposure and outcomes was primarily assessed using restricted cubic splines (RCS), weighted multivariable logistic regression, and subgroup analysis. In the Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, the outcome was precisely defined as coronary heart disease (CHD), and the data primarily originated from the IEU OpenGWAS project.RESULTS A total of 10,158 participants aged 20–59 years were included, with a prevalence of cardiovascular diseases at 3.4%. Regional body fat was primarily associated with heart disease rather than with stroke. The RCS indicated a positive linear correlation between all body fat masses and the percentage of heart disease. After adjusting for confounding factors, logistic regression analysis revealed significant associations between heart disease and head fat mass (unit: 0.1 kg, odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, p = 0.002), head fat percentage (unit: 1%, OR = 1.37, p = 0.018), arm fat mass (unit: 1 kg, OR = 1.18, p = 0.047), and trunk fat mass (unit: 2.5 kg, OR = 1.14, p = 0.027). Leg fat mass and percentage of fat in the arms, trunk, and legs showed no significant correlation with heart disease (p > 0.05). The IEU OpenGWAS database does not include head-fat information. MR meta-analysis indicated that the fat mass and percentage in the arms, trunk, and legs were all causally related to CHD.CONCLUSION Head fat mass, head fat percentage, arm fat mass, and trunk fat mass were all associated with heart disease and were likely causally related.WHAT IS KNOWN Trunk fat mass is positively associated with certain cardiovascular risk factors, while leg fat mass is the opposite.Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry measures regional body fat, characterized by its speed, low radiation exposure, and cost-effectiveness, making it suitable for community settings.WHAT THE STUDY ADDS In middle-aged and young adults, regional body fat mass and percentage are not associated with stroke.Head fat mass, head fat percentage, arm fat mass, and trunk fat mass are all associated with heart disease and are likely causally related.Measurement of fat in the head, arms, and trunk may contribute to early screening forheart diseases in middle-aged and young adults."

In recent years, despite Burundi maintaining high coverage in all antigens (over 80% since the launch of the PEV in 1980), performance has begun to decline. From 2015 to 2017, all coverage rates experienced a slight regression, and the WHO/UNICEF figures for 2018 confirm this downward trend. The objective of this work is to contribute to the reduction of infant morbidity and mortality due to vaccine-preventable diseases by identifying factors associated with correct vaccination among children aged 24 to 48 months hospitalized in national hospitals in Bujumbura.Methodology A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in 4 national hospitals in Burundi. A sample of 216 children was selected, and the collected data were entered into Epinfo 7.2 software and transferred to Stata 15 for analysis. Three types of analyses were performed: descriptive analysis, univariate logistic regression, and multivariate logistic regression. After modeling, variables with a p-value <0.05 were considered associated with correct vaccination.Results Out of 216 children, correct vaccination was observed in 64.81%. The average age of mothers was 29.4 ± 5.43 years, ranging from 15 to 45 years. Factors significantly associated with correct vaccination after modeling were: husband’s level of education [OR = 15.41; P = 0.021], household income [OR = 10.23; P = 0.021], distance from residence to vaccination facility [OR = 0.12; P = 0.000], and mothers’ knowledge levels of vaccine-preventable diseases [OR = 1.73; P = 0.004]. The model was well-calibrated (the p-value of the Lemeshow test is 0.6697) with a 90% capacity to correctly classify observations.Conclusion The study’s results indicate that children are not properly vaccinated despite the service being free. Various factors influencing correct vaccination status were identified, including the level of education of the head of the household, income level, distance to vaccination facilities, and mothers’ knowledge of vaccine-preventable diseases. It is essential to implement interventions targeting these factors associated with correct vaccination to reduce morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases."

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to analyze such data, however, often requires high-quality annotations that are difficult to obtain. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) has shown promising performance on a variety of NLP tasks in the health domain with little to no annotated data. However, their potential in analyzing health-related social media data remains underexplored. In this paper, we report empirical evaluations of LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo, FLAN-T5, and BERT-based models) on a common NLP task of health-related social media data: sentiment analysis for identifying opinions toward health issues. We explored how different prompting and fine-tuning strategies affect the performance of LLMs on social media datasets across diverse health topics, including Healthcare Reform, vaccination, mask wearing, and healthcare service quality. We found that LLMs outperformed VADER, a widely used off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tool, but are far from being able to produce accurate sentiment labels. However, their performance can be improved by data-specific prompts with information about the context, task, and targets. The highest performing LLMs are BERT-based models that were fine-tuned on aggregated data. We provided practical tips for researchers to use LLMs on health-related social media data for optimal outcomes. We also discuss future work needed to continue to improve the performance of LLMs for analyzing health-related social media data with minimal annotations."

The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to eliminate schistosomiasis by 2030, predominantly relying on a strategy of mass drug administration (MDA) using praziquantel. The effectiveness of MDA can vary widely among disease foci. Mathematical modelling is increasingly being used to understand the transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis and for predicting the effectiveness of MDA and time frames to elimination. Due to the highly focal nature of schistosomiasis, many key parameters influencing its transmission are likely highly geographically variable. Yet typically models do not fully integrate this uncertainty into predictions. This can lead to unrealistic expectations on the prospects for elimination. Here, we present a schistosomiasis transmission model to evaluate how uncertainty in parameters relating to local socio-ecological conditions influence resilience of the parasite population to intervention and the effectiveness of MDA. We discuss the growing importance of incorporating uncertainty in mathematical models for this and other NTDs to enable transparent communication of predictions as we move towards the 2030 elimination goals."

Pharmacokinetic models and expanding clinical data in pregnancy may support antenatal doses. In this article, we introduce a comprehensive and user-driven Framework for Dose Selection in Pregnancy (FDSP), developed and validated to support the clinical implementation of best-evidence and in some cases, model-informed doses for pregnant women and/or fetuses. After initial development and validation by experts, the framework prototype was piloted to formulate an antenatal dosing strategy for sertraline in depression and anxiety disorders. Next, the framework was validated and assessed for usability by a multidisciplinary working committee of end-users comprising healthcare practitioners, experts from other disciplines including pharmacometrics, reproductive toxicology and medical ethics, alongside pregnant women and a partner. The resulting framework encompasses the following: rationale for drug selection, a comprehensive analysis of pharmacokinetic and dose-related efficacy and safety data, and implementation aspects including feasibility and desirability of the recommended antenatal dose based on a structured maternal and fetal benefit-risk assessment. An antenatal dose recommendation for sertraline, as a proof-of-concept, was formulated using this approach and endorsed for clinical use by the working committee. The FDSP, as demonstrated by the example of sertraline, is fit for supporting the development of best-evidence acceptable and clinically feasible antenatal doses."

Here we present GWAS meta-analyses across six cohorts for male and female infertility in up to 41,200 cases and 687,005 controls. We identified 21 genetic risk loci for infertility (P≤5E-08), of which 12 have not been reported for any reproductive condition. We found positive genetic correlations between endometriosis and all-cause female infertility (rg=0.585, P=8.98E-14), and between polycystic ovary syndrome and anovulatory infertility (rg=0.403, P=2.16E-03). The evolutionary persistence of female infertility-risk alleles in EBAG9 may be explained by recent directional selection. We additionally identified up to 269 genetic loci associated with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone, oestradiol, and testosterone through sex-specific GWAS meta-analyses (N=6,095-246,862). While hormone-associated variants near FSHB and ARL14EP colocalised with signals for anovulatory infertility, we found no rg between female infertility and reproductive hormones (P>0.05). Exome sequencing analyses in the UK Biobank (N=197,340) revealed that women carrying testosterone-lowering rare variants in GPC2 were at higher risk of infertility (OR=2.63, P=1.25E-03). Taken together, our results suggest that while individual genes associated with hormone regulation may be relevant for fertility, there is limited genetic evidence for correlation between reproductive hormones and infertility at the population level. We provide the first comprehensive view of the genetic architecture of infertility across multiple diagnostic criteria in men and women, and characterise its relationship to other health conditions."

We aim to investigate the epidemiological and genomic characteristics of VREfm in China.Methods We collected 20747 non-redundant E. faecium isolates from inpatients across 19 hospitals in six provinces between Jan 2018 and June 2023. VREfm was confirmed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The prevalence was analyzed using changepoint package in R. Genomic characteristics were explored by whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis.Results 5.59% (1159/20747) of E. faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin. The prevalence of VREfm increased in Guangdong province from 5% before 2021 to 20%-50% in 2023 (p<0.0001), but not in the other five provinces. The two predominant clones before 2021, ST17 and ST78, were substituted by an emerging clone, ST80, from 2021 to 2023 (88.63%, 195/220). All ST80 VREfm from Guangdong formed a single lineage (SC11) and were genetically distant from the ST80 VREfm from other countries, suggesting a regional outbreak. All ST80 VREfm in SC11 carried a new type of plasmid which harbored a vanA cassette (vanRSHAXYZ) flanked by Tn1546/Tn3 clusters. However, no conjugation-related gene was detected and no transconjugant was obtained in conjugation experiment, indicating that the outbreak of ST80 VREfm could be attributed to clonal transmission.Conclusions We revealed an ongoing outbreak of ST80 VREfm with a new vanA-harboring plasmid in Guangdong, China. This clone has also been identified in other provinces and countries, foreboding a risk of wider spreading shortly. Continuous surveillance is needed to inform public health interventions."

While engagement in the HIV Care Continuum (e.g., HIV care visits, antiretroviral (ART) prescribed, ART adherence) is essential to reduce viral load, HIV transmission, and related morbidity, the extent to which TGD people engage in one or more steps of the HIV Care Continuum at similar levels as cisgender people is understudied on a national level and by gendered subgroups.Methods and Findings We used Medicare Fee-for-Service claims data from 2009 to 2017 to identify TGD (trans feminine and non-binary (TFN), trans masculine and non-binary (TMN), unclassified gender) and cisgender (male, female) beneficiaries with HIV. Using a retrospective cross-sectional design, we explored within- and between-gender group differences in the predicted probability (PP) of engaging in one or more steps of the HIV Care Continuum. TGD individuals had a higher predicted probability of every HIV Care Continuum outcome compared to cisgender individuals [HIV Care Visits: TGD PP=0.22, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI)=0.22-0.24; cisgender PP=0.21, 95% CI=0.21-0.22); Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Screening (TGD PP=0.12, 95% CI=0.11-0.12; cisgender PP=0.09, 95% CI=0.09-0.10); ART Prescribed (TGD PP=0.61, 95% CI=0.59-0.63; cisgender PP=0.52, 95% CI=0.52-0.54); and ART Persistence or adherence (90% persistence: TGD PP=0.27, 95% CI=0.25-0.28; 95% persistence: TGD PP=0.13, 95% CI=0.12-0.14; 90% persistence: cisgender PP=0.23, 95% CI=0.22-0.23; 95% persistence: cisgender PP=0.11, 95% CI=0.11-0.12)]. Notably, TFN individuals had the highest probability of every outcome (HIV Care Visits PP =0.25, 95% CI=0.24-0.27; STI Screening PP =0.22, 95% CI=0.21-0.24; ART Prescribed PP=0.71, 95% CI=0.69-0.74; 90% ART Persistence PP=0.30, 95% CI=0.28-0.32; 95% ART Persistence PP=0.15, 95% CI=0.14-0.16) and TMN people or cisgender females had the lowest probability of every outcome (HIV Care Visits: TMN PP =0.18, 95% CI=0.14-0.22; STI Screening: Cisgender Female PP =0.11, 95% CI=0.11-0.12; ART Receipt: Cisgender Female PP=0.40, 95% CI=0.39-0.42; 90% ART Persistence: TMN PP=0.15, 95% CI=0.11-0.20; 95% ART Persistence: TMN PP=0.07, 95% CI=0.04-0.10). The main limitation of this research is that TGD and cisgender beneficiaries were included based on their observed care, whereas individuals who did not access relevant care through Fee-for-Service Medicare at any point during the study period were not included. Thus, our findings may not be generalizable to all TGD and cisgender individuals with HIV, including those with Medicare Advantage or other types of insurance.Conclusions Although TGD beneficiaries living with HIV had superior engagement in the HIV Care Continuum than cisgender individuals, findings highlight notable disparities in engagement for TMN individuals and cisgender females, and engagement was still low for all Medicare beneficiaries, independent of gender. Interventions are needed to reduce barriers to HIV care engagement for all Medicare beneficiaries to improve treatment outcomes and reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality in the US."

This rapid scoping review aims to broadly map the existing literature on this subject, focusing on children aged less than six years, and to identify areas where further research is needed.Objectives To explore the extent and nature of research on fathers’ roles in feeding care and dental hygiene practices for children under six years old. The review aims to identify key themes, variations in fatherly involvement across different contexts, and gaps in the current literature.Methods A structured search of key databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus, was performed. Studies included in the review involved fathers of children aged less than six years and addressed aspects of feeding care or dental hygiene. The process involved screening for relevance, categorizing studies into thematic areas, and summarizing overarching themes.Results The search yielded 15 studies encompassing diverse geographical and socio-cultural contexts. The review underscores the variability in fathers’ roles, influenced by factors such as urbanization, education, and cultural norms. It reveals that while fathers often serve as financial providers and role models, direct involvement in feeding and dental hygiene is less common. Notably, the literature on fathers’ involvement in children’s dental hygiene is limited.Conclusions Fathers’ roles in feeding care and dental hygiene practices for children under six years are multifaceted and context dependent. The review highlights significant gaps, particularly in understanding the involvement of fathers in dental hygiene. Addressing these gaps through future research is essential for developing comprehensive family-centred health care strategies and policies."

The two training gropes exercised bi-weekly for 12-week. Measurements included blood pressure, waist circumference, BMI, 15-repetition maximum-strength tests, and a LALA aerobic shuttle test analyzed using a linear mixed model.Results Weight circumference decreased in both the Gym and Zoom groups (P=.0202 and P=.0014 respectively); in addition, in both these groups systolic (P=.018, P=.0001 respectively) and diastolic (P=.086 -marginal significance, P<.0001 respectively) blood pressure decreased, with a more pronounced reduction in the diastolic blood pressure for the Zoom-group (P=.043). Maximum aerobic speed increased (P<.0001) in the Zoom-group, with the Gym-group achieving the same speed with a lower peak heart rate (P=.0144). Strength significantly improved in the Zoom group for row (P=.05) and knee-extension (P<.0001) exercises. The Gym group improved in all strength measures (Row P<.0001, Chest-press P<.0001, and Knee-extension P<.0001). The Gym-group’s gains were greater than the Zoom-group’s in the row (P<.0001) and knee-extension (P=.005) exercises. The Control-group experienced a rise in BMI (P=.0256), waist circumference (P=.056 marginal significance), and systolic blood pressure (P=.055 marginal significance).Conclusion Both exercise programs effectively reduced health-risk factors. The Zoom-group excelled in improving aerobic capacity and diastolic blood pressure, while the Gym-group demonstrated superior strength gains. Not exercising was detrimental to body mass, waist circumference, and blood pressure.Impact Exercise programs enhance long life heath and prevent health deterioration in adults with cerebral palsy. Results endorse using waist circumference and blood pressure measures as valuable clinical outcomes for adults with cerebral palsy."

Given its parallels with the Act on Secondary Use of Health and Social Data (Secondary Use Act) implemented in Finland in 2020, this study examines the consequences of heightened privacy constraints on registry-based medical research. Between 2020 and 2023, a median of 5.5% fewer data permits were approved annually by Finnish university hospitals. Based on linear regression modelling, we estimated a reduction of 46.9% in new data permits nationally in 2023 compared to the expected count. Similar changes were not observed in other medical research types highlighting the consequences of excessive data privacy laws on registry-based medical research."

This study aims to construct and externally validate a predictive model for CCU readmission using machine learning (ML) algorithms across multiple hospitals. Patient information, including demographics, medical history, and laboratory test results were collected from electronic health record system and contributed to a total of 40 features. Three ML models, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were employed to estimate the readmission risk. The gradient boosting model was selected demonstrated superior performance with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.887 in the internal validation set. Further external validation in hold-out test set and three other medical centers upheld the model’s robustness with consistent high AUCs, ranging from 0.852 to 0.879. The results endorse the integration of ML algorithms in healthcare to enhance patient risk stratification, potentially optimizing clinical interventions and diminishing the burden of CCU readmissions.Key learning points What is already known:Readmission to the CCU has significant implications for both patient outcomes and healthcare costs.Accurately distinguishing patients at high or low risk for CCU readmission is essential for clinicians to allocate resources effectivelyWhat this study adds:A predictive model for CCU readmission was constructed using machine learning algorithms trained from one medical center and validated externally in three major medical centers.Among the ML models evaluated, the Gradient Boosting model showed the highest performance with an AUC of 0.879 in hold-out test set, and its robustness was further confirmed in external validation across three medical centers with an AUC range from 0.848-0.863.By using different cut-off thresholds to prioritize the model’s sensitivity or specificity, clinicians can distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients, enabling them to determine the appropriate level of monitoring and treatment planning for those at high risk."

There are, however, unknowns that have the potential to hinder the achievement and measurement of this goal. These include asymptomatic gHAT infections (inclusive of the potential to self-cure or harbour skin-only infections) and whether gHAT infection in animals can contribute to the transmission cycle in humans. Using modelling we explore how cryptic (undetected) transmission impacts the monitoring of progress towards as well as the achievement of the EoT goal. We have developed gHAT models that include either asymptomatic or animal transmission, and compare these to a baseline gHAT model without either of these transmission routes, to explore the potential role of cryptic infections on the EoT goal. Each model was independently calibrated using available historic human case data for 2000––2020 (obtained from the World Health Organization’s HAT Atlas) which includes routine data from active and passive screening for five different health zones in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).Our results suggest that when matched to past case data, we estimated similar numbers of new human infections between model variants, although human infections were slightly higher in the models with cryptic infections. We simulated the continuation of screen-confirm-and-treat interventions and found that forward projections from the animal and asymptomatic transmission models produced lower probabilities of EoT than the baseline model. Simulation of a (as yet to be available) screen-and-treat strategy found that removing a parasitological confirmation step was predicted to have a more noticeable benefit to transmission reduction under the asymptomatic model compared to the others. Our simulations suggest vector control could greatly impact all transmission routes in all models, although this resource-intensive intervention should be carefully prioritised."

Modelling can provide key insights informing epidemic response, hence synthesising current evidence about EVD epidemiology and models is critical to prepare for future outbreaks.Methods We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42023393345) and meta-analysis of EVD transmission models and parameters characterising EVD transmission, evolution, natural history, severity, risk factors and seroprevalence published prior to 7th July 2023 from PubMed and Web of Science. Two people screened each abstract and full text. Papers were extracted using a bespoke Access database, 10% were double extracted. Meta- analyses were conducted to synthesise information where possible.Findings We extracted 1,280 parameters and 295 models from 522 papers. Basic reproduction number estimates were highly variable (central estimates between 0.1 and 12.0 for high quality assessment scores), as were effective reproduction numbers, likely reflecting spatiotemporal variability in interventions. Pooled random effect estimates were 15.4 days (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 13.2-17.5) for the serial interval, 8.5 (95% CI 7.7-9.2) for the incubation period, 9.3 (95% CI 8.5-10.1) for the symptom-onset-to-death delay and 13.0 (95% CI 10.4-15.7) for symptom-onset-to-recovery. Common effect estimates were similar albeit with narrower CIs. Case fatality ratio estimates were generally high but highly variable (from 0 to 100%), which could reflect heterogeneity in underlying risk factors such as age and caring responsibilities.Interpretation While a significant body of literature exists on EVD models and epidemiological parameter estimates, many of these studies focus on the West African Ebola epidemic and are primarily associated with Zaire Ebola virus. This leaves a critical gap in our knowledge regarding other Ebola virus species and outbreak contexts.Funding UKRI, NIHR, Academy of Medical Sciences, Wellcome, UK Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy, BHF, Diabetes UK, Schmidt Foundation, Community Jameel, Royal Society, and Imperial College London.Evidence before this study We searched Web of Science and PubMed up to 7th July 2023 using the search terms: Ebola, epidemiology, outbreaks, models, transmissibility, severity, delays, risk factors, mutation rates and seroprevalence. We identified 179 reviews or overviews of different aspects of Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission, of which we explored 11 that had “systematic” or “meta” in the title plus one included by expert recommendation. Five reviews focused on case fatality ratios, with estimates ranging between 34-42% for the Bundibugyo Ebola virus species, 53-69% for the Sudan species, 31.6-100% for the Zaire species, and pooled estimates ranging between 28-65% from reviews not specifying the species. Three reviews estimated seroprevalence to be between 3.3-8% depending on the setting and time. Three reviews investigated risk factors and found that caring for a case in the community and participation in traditional funeral rites are strongly associated with acquiring disease. Two reviews reported the incubation period to be 6.3 days for the Bundibugyo species, a range of 3.35-14 days for the Sudan species, and a range of 9-11.4 days across studies on the Zaire species. We found one review considering each of the following: basic reproduction number (1.34– 2.7 for Sudan species and 1.8 for Zaire species), serial interval (15-15.3 days for Zaire species), latent period (11.75 days for a combination of Zaire and unspecified species), and secondary attack rates (12.5%, species unspecified). Two reviews consider transmission models, identifying that it is difficult to accurately model the impact of time-dependent changing factors without high quality data, and data are often missing, complicating proper parameterisation of the underlying transmission mechanisms. One specific review looked at the Sudan EVD in response to the outbreak in Uganda in 2023, which highlighted the lack of vaccines and treatment available for this species.Added value of this study We provide a comprehensive summary of all available peer reviewed literature of transmission models and the variables needed to parameterise them across all EVD species and outbreaks. Our study synthesises all available analyses until 2023 and additionally considers attack rates, overdispersion and mutation rates. We give updated pooled random effects meta-analyses of incubation periods, serial intervals, symptom onset to death and symptom onset to recovery and, where possible, provide species-specific estimates in the Supplementary Material. We also provide ranges for the basic reproduction number and case fatality ratios without running meta-analyses because these are very setting dependent. We identify that most evidence (92%) is for the Zaire species and highlight that there are knowledge gaps for other species, which should be explored in the future. All our data is held within a bespoke open-source R package to enable others to use this information easily during their model building and updates.Implications of all the available evidence Previous outbreaks of infectious pathogens, including the 2013-2016 West African EVD epidemic, emphasise the usefulness of computational modelling in assessing epidemic dynamics and the impact of mitigation strategies. Our study provides an updated and broader overview of all the necessary information for designing and parameterising mathematical models for use in future outbreaks of EVD, including a centralised database for other researchers to use and contribute data to."

As a strategy to achieve UHC, the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) introduced new premium packages in September 2019 named TIMIZA, NAJALI and WEKEZA premium packages to accommodate private individuals and their families who are not in the formal employment sector to increase the coverage of citizens who are health insured in the country and to increase their accessibility to quality health services. Since the introduction of these packages no studies have been done to assess their performance. Therefore, this study evaluated the performance of the packages through process evaluation by exploring its level of utilization from September 2019, the acceptability of the packages by the health care providers and client satisfaction towards the services offered.Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in selected NHIF accredited health facilities in Kinondoni Municipal using mixed method of data collection. Secondary data was quantitatively extracted from NHIF enrollment registries using a data abstraction tool to assess the percentage of citizens enrolled from Kinondoni NHIF office from September 2019 to March 2021.In-depth interview was used to evaluate the acceptability of the packages among the health care providers and Clients (beneficiaries) satisfaction towards the quality of services offered. Qualitative data was analyzed by content analysis approach and Microsoft excel for the quantitative data.Results NHIF has been able to enroll 17,248 members which is only 1% of the total population of people in Kinondoni MC against their set target which was to enroll at least 50% of the total population. Beneficiaries of the packages are unsatisfied and health providers are also unhappy about the packages due to poor orientation, cumbersome referral system and uncertainties in availability of medications and investigations.Conclusion and Recommendation This evaluation has revealed that NHIF new packages have not been performing well since their introduction in September 2019. They are far from reaching the set target due to challenges which have been brought forward by beneficiaries and health care providers. NHIF need to improve their orientation by educating their clients about every service covered in a scheme before enrollment. Also, they should perform biannual review of their list of medicines and services covered by constantly updating their medicines list according to the pharmaceutical and insurance market."

Data from medical records were evaluated regarding age, symptoms, presence of arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypopituitarism, size of the initial lesion, invasiveness (cavernous sinus invasion), T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity, GH and insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1) levels, treatment performed [surgery, use of somatostatin receptor ligands (SRL), pegvisomant, cabergoline and bromocriptine and radiotherapy] and response to surgical or adjuvant treatment (normal levels of GH and/or IGF-1 after each treatment instituted).Patients were divided into groups according to the size of the adenoma at diagnosis (group I = ≤ 10 mm, II = 10-19 mm, III = 20-29 mm, IV = 30-39 mm and V = ≥ 40 mm), and comparisons were made between the 5 groups and two-by-two comparisons.Results 117 patients were studied (59 women, age at diagnosis 43 ± 13 years). Group I consisted of 11 patients (9%), group II of 54 (46%), group III of 34 (29%), group IV of 10 (9%) and group V of 8 patients (7%). The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypopituitarism were 49%, 25% and 28%, respectively. Hypopituitarism, invasiveness, and the use of SRL had their prevalence increased according to the size of the adenoma, as well as GH levels. Age, on the other hand, showed a negative correlation with tumor size, and group I was older when compared to the group with macroadenoma. The ROC curves showed that in relation to the size of the adenoma at diagnosis, most of the outcomes evaluated (hypopituitarism, invasiveness, radiotherapy, use of SRL, use of medications other than SRL, disease control after surgery) occurred with a tumor diameter of around 20 mm.Conclusion Our study demonstrated that microadenomas and macroadenomas < 20 mm are associated with lower morbidity and better therapeutic response in acromegaly. From a tumor diameter of 20 mm, there was no significant difference in the clinical, therapeutic and prognostic behavior of GH-secreting pituitary adenomas.Trial Registration number (Plataforma Brasil) CAAE 30066220.2.0000.0096 (April 02, 2020)"

This study aims to examine the provision and specificity of GAI usage guidelines and their relationships with journal characteristics.Methods From the SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) list for medicine in 2022, we selected 98 journals as top journals to represent highly indexed journals and 144 as whole-spectrum sample journals to represent all medical journals. We examined their GAI usage guidelines for scholarly publishing between December 2023 and January 2024.Results Compared to whole-spectrum sample journals, the top journals were more likely to provide author guidelines (64.3% vs. 27.8%) and reviewer guidelines (11.2% vs. 0.0%) as well as refer to external guidelines (85.7% vs 74.3%). Probit models showed that SJR score or region was not associated with the provision of these guidelines among top journals. However, among whole-spectrum sample journals, SJR score was positively associated with the provision of author guidelines (0.85, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.25) and references to external guidelines (2.01, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.65). Liner models showed that SJR score was positively associated with the specificity level of author and reviewer guidelines among whole-spectrum sample journals (1.21, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.70), and no such pattern was observed among top journals.Conclusions The provision of GAI usage guidelines is limited across medical journals, especially for reviewer guidelines. The lack of specificity and consistency in existing guidelines highlights areas deserving improvement. These findings suggest that immediate attention is needed to guide GAI usage in scholarly publishing in medical journals.Question What are the provision and specificity of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) usage guidelines for scholarly publishing in top and whole-spectrum medical journals and their relationships with journal characteristics?Findings Author guidelines were more abundant and specific in top journals than in whole-spectrum journals. However, reviewer guidelines were extremely scarce in both groups of journals. Journal ranking score was associated with both provision and specificity of GAI usage guidelines in whole-spectrum journals while no significant relationship was found in top journals.Meaning The lack of provision and specificity as well as the inconsistencies in existing guidelines suggest that immediate attention is needed to guide GAI usage in scholarly publishing and safeguard integrity and trust in medical research."

This process could be hampered by stroke-associated cognitive impairments, such as the capability to rapidly follow instructions (Rapid instructed task learning, RITL). RITL was never directly studied in old adults and subjects with stroke. The aim of this study was to assess RITL following stroke and its underlying cognitive determinants.Methods 31 subjects with chronic stroke and 36 age-matched controls completed a computerized cognitive examination that included an anti-saccade task for measuring prepotent inhibition and processing speed and stimulus-response association task (NEXT) for measuring RITL and proactive inhibition.Results RITL abilities were impaired after stroke, together with prepotent inhibition and processing speed. A correlation analysis revealed that RITL is associated with prepotent inhibition abilities and with processing speed.Conclusions Subjects with stroke show impairments in the ability to follow instructions, that may be related to their impaired prepotent inhibition and processing speed. The causal effect of RITL impairments on the responsivity to rehabilitation and on motor recovery should be examined."

We recruited n=131 participants with acute LBP from the community and followed them for 3 and 6-month outcomes. Acute LBP was defined by a duration of < 4 weeks, and participants must have reported a 30-day LBP-free period before the current acute episode. Chronic LBP was defined as pain most or every day over the past 3 months. Baseline psychological, social, and demographic factors were examined as predictors of transition to chronic LBP at 3 months or continuation of chronic LBP at 6 months. The transition from acute to chronic LBP at 3 months was 32.2% ( 38/118). At 6 months, 80.7% (25/111) of participants who transitioned at 3 months continued to have chronic LBP. At 6 months, participants who identified as Black or African American were more likely than white participants to transition to chronic LBP (RR=1.76, 95% CI 1.05, 2.95) and more likely to continue to have chronic LBP (RR=2.19, 95% CI 1.14, 4.21). Those classified at baseline by both LBP most or every day and intensity of at least 30/100 were more likely to transition to chronic LBP (RR=3.13, 95% CI 1.84, 5.30) and continue to have chronic LBP at 6 months (RR=2.58, 95% CI 1.43, 4.16). The STarT Back Screening Tool and the OSPRO-YF were associated with the transition to chronic LBP at 3 months and continuation at 6 months. Participants with higher PROMIS General Health and PROMIS Physical Health scores were less likely to transition to chronic LBP or continue to have chronic LBP at 6 months. These findings identify factors of acute LBP in the community that may predict the transition to chronic LBP. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and better understand the mechanisms driving the transition to chronic LBP."

Travel of infected individuals from one region to another can transport a virus to places that were previously unaffected or may accelerate the spread of disease in places where the disease is not yet well established. We develop and apply models and metrics to analyze the role of inter-regional travel relative to the spread of disease, drawing from data on Covid-19 in the United States. To better understand how transportation affects disease transmission, we established a multi-regional time-varying compartmental disease model with spatial interaction. The compartmental model was integrated with statistical estimates of travel between regions. From the integrated model, we derived a transmission import index to assess the risk of Covid-19 transmission between states. Based on the index, we determined states with high risk for disease spreading to other states at months scale, and we analyzed how the index changed over time during 2020. Our model provides a tool for policymakers to evaluate the influence of travel between regions on disease transmission in support of strategies for epidemic control."

With a steep increase in breast cancer morbidity and mortality, there exists a critical need for effective early-stage theragnostic and prognostic biomarkers. This would help in patient stratification and optimal treatment selection towards better disease management. In this study, we examined four key problems with respect to the characterization of breast cancer heterogeneity, namely: (i) cancer screening; (ii) identification of metastatic cancers; (iii) molecular subtype (TNBC, HER2, or luminal); and (iv) histological subtype (ductal or lobular). We mined the available public-domain transcriptomic data of breast cancer patients from the TCGA and other databases using stage-encoded statistical models of gene expression, and identified stage-salient, monotonically expressed, and problem-specific biomarkers. Next we trained different classes of machine learning algorithms targeted at the above problems and embedded in these feature spaces. Hyperparameters specific to each algorithm were optimized using 10-fold cross-validation on the training dataset. The optimized models were evaluated on the holdout testset to identify the overall best model for each problem. The best model for each problem was validated with: (i) multi-omics data from the same cohort (miRNA and methylation profiles); (ii) external datasets from out-of-domain cohorts; and (iii) state of the art, including commercially available breast cancer panels. External validation of our models matched or bested available benchmarks in the respective problem domains (balanced accuracies of 97.42% for cancer vs normal; 88.22% for metastatic v/s non metastatic; 88.79% for ternary molecular subtyping; and ensemble accuracy of 94.23% for histological subtyping). We have translated the results into BC-Predict, a freely available web-server that forks the best models developed for each problem, and provides the cascade annotation of input instance(s) of expression data, along with uncertainty estimates.

In addition, predictive models in Mental Health do not properly assess speech-based systems’ limitations, such as uncertainty, or fairness for a safe clinical deployment.Objective We investigated the predictive potential of mobile-collected speech data for detecting and estimating depression, anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia, focusing beyond mere accuracy, in the general population.Methods We included n=435 healthy adults and recorded their answers concerning their perceived mental and sleep states. We asked them how they felt and if they had slept well lately. Clinically validated questionnaires measured depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue severity. We developed a novel speech and machine learning pipeline involving voice activity detection, feature extraction, and model training. We detected voice activity automatically with a bidirectional neural network and examined participants’ speech with a fully ML automatic pipeline to capture speech variability. Then, we modelled speech with a ThinResNet model that was pre-trained on a large open free database. Based on this speech modelling, we evaluated clinical threshold detection, individual score prediction, model uncertainty estimation, and performance fairness across demographics (age, sex, education). We employed a train-validation-test split for all evaluations: to develop our models, select the best ones and assess the generalizability of held-out data.Results Our methods achieved high detection performance for all symptoms, particularly depression (PHQ-9 AP=0.77, BDI AP=0.83), insomnia (AIS AP=0.86), and fatigue (MFI Total Score AP=0.88). These strengths were maintained while ensuring high abstention rates for uncertain cases (Risk-Coverage AUCs < 0.1). Individual symptom scores were predicted with good accuracy (Correlations were all significant, with Pearson strengths between 0.59 and 0.74). Fairness analysis revealed that models were consistent for sex (average Disparity Ratio (DR) = 0.77), to a lesser extent for education level (average Disparity Ratio (DR) = 0.44) and worse for age groups (average Disparity Ratio (DR) = 0.26).Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of speech-based systems for multifaceted mental health assessment in the general population, not only for detecting clinical thresholds but also for estimating their severity. Addressing fairness and incorporating uncertainty estimation with selective classification are key contributions that can enhance the clinical utility and responsible implementation of such systems. This approach offers promise for more accurate and nuanced mental health assessments, potentially benefiting both patients and clinicians."

Despite this, little research has focused on the experiences of those using intrapartum care during this time. This study aimed to elevate the voices and document the experiences of birthing people in Nampula Province, Mozambique during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a longitudinal qualitative study from March-August 2021 and present an analysis of the 17 follow-up in-depth interviews conducted with participants who had a vaginal live birth. Interviews explored participants’ experience of labor and delivery care. They were conducted in Makua and Portuguese, audio-recorded, transcribed and translated. We applied thematic content analysis. Overall, participants did not express major concerns about COVID-19 or related service adaptations when describing their experiences of intrapartum care. Some noted its negative effects on elements of respectful care such as restricting birth companions. Overcrowding became more concerning due to the threat of infection. While unclear if affected by the pandemic, all participants who gave birth at a health facility reported experiencing at least one form of mistreatment, some recounting threats of cesarean delivery. Most explained that they and their newborns received care without their consent, especially regarding enemas and episiotomies. At the same time, respondents described a range of intrapartum experiences that included both respectful and disrespectful care. Most recalled positive verbal communication with their providers and many described receiving continuous attentive care. Participants explained that their satisfaction with childbirth services was tied to their birth outcome and their experience of respectful care. The findings indicate that steadfast commitments to quality care are critical to ensure families benefit from high-quality, respectful care at all times. The ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic were limited but nonetheless signal a need for tighter connections between maternal health and emergency preparedness stakeholders."

Devices typically consist of a bundle of thousands of fiber membranes in a housing, with gas flowing inside the fibers and blood flowing in the opposite direction outside the fibers. Both ends of the fiber membranes are attached with an adhesive to prevent direct contact between gas and blood. The shape of the volume through which the blood flows is determined by the housing of the oxygenator and the internal end surfaces of the bonded parts of the fiber-membrane bundle. The traditional potting process results in a volume shape that is associated with stagnation zones, which are known to promote thrombus formation. In this study, an adapted potting process is proposed which results in a blood compartment with beveled end faces of the glued bundle parts. Using a numerical study, we have demonstrated that the novel oxygenator design results in optimized flow conditions."

We aimed to compare pharmacological treatments for gambling disorder in terms of efficacy and tolerability, using network meta-analysis (NMA).Methods We searched, up to 19 February 2024, a broad range of databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, AMED, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ERIC and Web of Science (including Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Science and Humanities (CPCI-SSH)) via Web of Knowledge and the WHO International Trials Registry Platform (including ClinicalTrials.gov), for double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of medications for gambling disorder. Outcomes were gambling symptom severity and quality of life (for efficacy), and tolerability. Confidence in the network estimates was assessed using the CINeMA framework. We followed the PRISMA-NMA guidelines and pre-registered the protocol [CRD42022329520].Outcomes We included 22 RCTs in the systematic review and 16 RCTs (n = 977 participants) in the NMA. Compared with placebo, moderate confidence evidence indicated that nalmefene [Standardized Mean Difference (SMD): −0·86; 95% confidence interval (CI: −1·32,-0·41)] reduced gambling severity, followed by naltrexone [-0·42; −0·85, 0·01)]. Nalmefene [Odds Ratio (OR): 7·55; 95%CI: 2·24-25·41] and naltrexone (7·82; 1·26-48·70) had significantly higher dropout due to side effects (lower tolerability) compared with placebo. Naltrexone (SMD: −0·50; 95%CI: −0·85,-0·14) and nalmefene (−0·36; −0·72,-0·01) were more beneficial than placebo in terms of quality of life. Olanzapine and topiramate were not more efficacious than placebo.Interpretation Nalmefene and naltrexone currently have the most supportive evidence for the pharmacological treatment of gambling disorder. Further clinical trials of novel compounds, and analysis of individual participant data are needed, to strengthen the evidence base, and help tailor treatments at the individual patient level.Funding This study was supported by unrestricted grant funds to Professor Chamberlain held at the University of Southampton, originating from the NHS.Evidence before this study Over the past few decades, there has been a substantial need for evidence-based pharmacological treatments of gambling disorder. However, the benefits and safety of medications trialled to treat gambling disorder remains debateable.Before planning this study, we searched PubMed on 01.06.2022 (and again on 16.03.2024 for any new evidence) for meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological treatments for gambling disorder, using the following syntax/search terms: gambling [tiab] AND meta-analy* [tiab]. We found two recent pairwise meta-analyses assessing the efficacy and tolerability of individual medications. However, we could not find any network meta-analysis (NMA) providing evidence on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications used for the treatment of gambling disorder. As NMAs have been successfully used to inform treatment approaches for other conditions, the lack of NMA of pharmacological treatments for gambling disorder is an important gap.Added value of this study We conducted the first NMA of pharmacological treatments for gambling, based on state-of-the-art methodology for NMA. Our NMA represents the most comprehensive synthesis to date on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological options to treat gambling disorder. Unlike previous systematic reviews and pairwise meta-analyses of head-to-head trials, we considered each treatment option separately (i.e., not as “class of medication”) and focused on clinically relevant outcomes – namely, the efficacy on gambling severity symptoms, tolerability and effects on the quality of life. We found that nalmefene and naltrexone currently have the most supportive evidence, in terms of clinical efficacy (reduction of gambling severity and improvement in quality of life), for the pharmacological treatment of gambling disorder, whereas olanzapine or topiramate had less or no supportive evidence. We also found that nalmefene and naltrexone were less well tolerated than placebo, which highlights the need for future clinical trials to broaden the evidence base.Implications of all the available evidence Evidence from our NMA supports the use of nalmefene and naltrexone in adults with gambling disorder as the preferred first pharmacological choice for the management of gambling disorder. Our NMA should inform future guidelines and supplement clinical decision-making on the choice of treatment for adults with gambling disorder, along with available evidence on psychological options, evidence on cost-effectiveness, and patients’ preferences. Future studies should evaluate a broader range of pharmacological agents for the treatment of gambling disorder .Future research should also include individual patient data in NMA of gambling disorder medications, which will allow a wider and more reliable estimation of predictors of individual response."

We established a prospective pediatric cohort to characterize the function of fecal microbiota and metabolite changes of treatment-naïve CD patients in response to EEN. Integrated multi-omics analysis identified network clusters from individually variable microbiome profiles, with Lachnospiraceae and medium chain fatty acids as protective features. Metagenomic analysis identified high strain-level dynamics in response to EEN cessation, and hundreds of bacterial gene functions with significant changes in abundance. Functional changes of diet-exposed fecal microbiota were further validated in a combined approach using gut chemostat cultures and microbiota transfer into germ-free Il10-deficient mice. EEN-like and fiber-repleted dietary model conditions, respectively, induced individual strain signatures to prevent or cause IBD-like inflammation in gnotobiotic mice. Hence, we provide evidence that EEN therapy operates through explicit functional changes of temporally and individually variable microbiome profiles."

In rare cases, however, infection with some subtypes can result in paralysis or death. Of the 300 subtypes known, only poliovirus is reportable, limiting our understanding of the distribution of other enteroviruses that can cause clinical disease.Objective The overarching objectives of this study were to: 1) describe the distribution of enteroviruses in Arizona during the late summer and fall of 2022, the time of year when they are thought to be most abundant, and 2) demonstrate the utility of viral pan-assay approaches for semi-agnostic discovery that can be followed up by more targeted assays and phylogenomics.Methods This study utilizes pooled nasal samples collected from school-aged children and long-term care facility residents, and wastewater from multiple locations in Arizona during July–October of 2022. We used PCR to amplify and sequence a region common to all enteroviruses, followed by species-level bioinformatic characterization using the QIIME 2 platform. For Enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68), detection was carried out using RT-qPCR, followed by confirmation using near-complete whole EV-D68 genome sequencing using a newly designed tiled amplicon approach.Results In the late summer and early fall of 2022, multiple enterovirus species were identified in Arizona wastewater, with Coxsackievirus A6, EV-D68, and Coxsackievirus A19 composing 86% of the characterized reads sequenced. While EV-D68 was not identified in pooled human nasal samples, and the only reported acute flaccid myelitis case in Arizona did not test positive for the virus, an in-depth analysis of EV-D68 in wastewater revealed that the virus was circulating from August through mid-October. A phylogenetic analysis on this relatively limited dataset revealed just a few importations into the state, with a single clade indicating local circulation.Significance This study further supports the utility of wastewater-based epidemiology to identify potential public health threats. Our further investigations into EV-D68 shows how these data might help inform healthcare diagnoses for children presenting with concerning neurological symptoms."

Our goals were to detect unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) from voice recordings using machine learning, to identify which acoustic variables were important for prediction to increase trust, and to determine model performance relative to clinician performance.Methods Patients with confirmed UVFP through endoscopic examination (N=77) and controls with normal voices matched for age and sex (N=77) were included. Voice samples were elicited by reading the Rainbow Passage and sustaining phonation of the vowel “a”. Four machine learning models of differing complexity were used. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to identify important features.Results The highest median bootstrapped ROC AUC score was 0.87 and beat clinician’s performance (range: 0.74 – 0.81) based on the recordings. Recording durations were different between UVFP recordings and controls due to how that data was originally processed when storing, which we can show can classify both groups. And counterintuitively, many UVFP recordings had higher intensity than controls, when UVFP patients tend to have weaker voices, revealing a dataset-specific bias which we mitigate in an additional analysis.Conclusion We demonstrate that recording biases in audio duration and intensity created dataset-specific differences between patients and controls, which models used to improve classification. Furthermore, clinician’s ratings provide further evidence that patients were over-projecting their voices and being recorded at a higher amplitude signal than controls. Interestingly, after matching audio duration and removing variables associated with intensity in order to mitigate the biases, the models were able to achieve a similar high performance. We provide a set of recommendations to avoid bias when building and evaluating machine learning models for screening in laryngology."

Depression is increasingly being conceptualised as a dysconnection syndrome and two large-scale networks surmised to contribute to the expression of depressive symptoms in premanifest HD are the striatum and the default mode network. Existing neuroimaging studies are limited and relied on functional connectivity: an inherently undirected measure of connectivity. Dynamic causal modelling allows testing of neurobiologically plausible models of connectivity changes in pre-specified networks. We investigated default mode network and striatal effective connectivity and depression in premanifest HD, using these model-based methods.We analysed 3T resting state fMRI data from 93 premanifest HD participants (51.6% females; Mage = 42.7). Behavioural measures included history of depression, Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd Edition (BDI-II) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, depression subscale (HADS-D). A cut-off score recommended for use in HD categorised clinically significant depressive symptoms. Regions of interest (ROIs) included medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, hippocampus, caudate, and putamen. Each ROI time series was calculated as the first principal component of the voxels’ activity within an 8 mm sphere for medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate and a 6 mm sphere for all other regions and was further constrained within masks. Spectral dynamic causal modelling was used to estimate subject-level connectivity and parametric empirical bayes was employed to estimate group-level effective connectivity between participants with self-report depression history and those without. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed for connections that reached this criterion.Model estimation was excellent, with average variance-explained of 89.70%. Having a depression diagnosis was associated with aberrant excitatory influence of both posterior and anterior DMN to hippocampi and striatal areas. No aberrant connections were found from medial prefrontal cortex to caudate or posterior cingulate. The present study demonstrates that aberrant connectivity patterns for premanifest HD with a history of depression is associated with coupling differences in depressive symptoms. Leave-one-out cross-validation accurately predicted clinically elevated depressive symptoms. Correct classification reached significance for HADS-D cut-off scores, corr(91) = −0.29: p = 0.002, and BDI-II scores, corr(91) = 0.36, p < 0.001.These findings suggest network dysconnection as a neural basis for depression in premanifest HD. Aberrant effective connections were associated with self-reported depression history, which was differentially associated with coupling changes in depressive symptoms. This adds to our understanding of the pathophysiology of HD and suggests defining functional networks of neuropsychiatric features plays an important role in understanding the disease."

Previous studies suggest that lipids may play a role in CIPN. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the particular types of lipids that are regulated as a consequence of paclitaxel administration and may be associated with the occurrence of post-therapeutic neuropathy.Methods High resolution mass spectrometry lipidomics was applied to quantify d = 255 different lipid mediators in the blood of n = 31 patients drawn before and after paclitaxel therapy for breast cancer treatment. A variety of supervised statistical and machine-learning methods was applied to identify lipids that were regulated during paclitaxel therapy or differed among patients with and without post-therapeutic neuropathy.Results Twenty-seven lipids were identified that carried relevant information to train machine learning algorithms to identify, in new cases, whether a blood sample was drawn before or after paclitaxel therapy with a median balanced accuracy of up to 90%. One of the top hits, sphinganine-1-phosphate (SA1P), was found to induce calcium transients in sensory neurons via the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors.SA1P also showed different blood concentrations between patients with and without neuropathy.Conclusions Present findings suggest a role for sphinganine-1-phosphate in paclitaxel-induced biological changes associated with neuropathic side effects. The identified SA1P, through its receptors, may provide a potential drug target for co-therapy with paclitaxel to reduce one of its major and therapy-limiting side effects."

This study aims to elicit the knowledge, attitude and perceptions of childbearing women towards uterine fibroids in order to provide empirical evidence informing relevant interventions oriented toward health promotion in this regard.Methods A quantitative, cross-sectional descriptive design was used and data were collected from a sample of 362 women of reproductive age residing in a selected township in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Durban University of Technology’s Institutional Research Ethics’ Committee (IREC – Ref No. BIREC 014/21). A pre-tested survey was conducted to gather data on knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions concerning uterine fibroids. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 27, employing descriptive statistics. Inferential statistics were also conducted to examine associations between key variables and respondents who self-reported being diagnosed with uterine fibroids.Results Most participants, 73.8% (n=267), had no awareness of uterine fibroids. Participants also demonstrated poor knowledge regarding the aetiology and symptoms of the condition. However, most participants, 49.2% (n=178), perceived uterine fibroids to be of spiritual origin, citing evil spirits and witchcraft as the cause. Participants subsequently reported that treatment would require herbal approaches and consultation with spiritualists such as traditional healers and seers. In summary, the study highlights various factors influencing self-reporting behaviours, including age, education level, employment status, marital status, number of children, awareness of the condition, perception of requiring treatment, family history, and symptom severity.Discussion and conclusion The study findings seem to suggest that women in the selected township lack accurate knowledge about uterine fibroids. These insights are valuable for shaping targeted health interventions and policies. Recognizing the complexities of self-reporting is crucial for improving health outcomes through early detection and tailored interventions."

Although artificial water fluoridation improves dental health and reduces dental health inequalities, there is concern that excessive fluoride exposure may lower cognition.We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed the association between water fluoride and intelligence quotient (IQ).Methods A literature search of Medline and Web of Science and random-effects meta-analysis comparing mean IQ of children living in low/normal or higher water fluoride areas was investigated. Followed by exploration of possible dose effects among sub-groups, living in moderate (<1.5 ppm) high (1.5-3.0 ppm) or extremely high (>3ppm) water fluoride areas.Results Twenty-three observational studies (n=9539 children) were included. Overall, the higher water fluoride group had a lower mean IQ compared with the low water fluoride group (standardised mean difference (95% confidence interval): -0.43 (-0.63 to -0.24) p<0.0001, I2=94.2% p<0.0001). Sub-group analysis showed no association between water fluoride and mean IQ in studies of moderate fluoride concentrations (moderate: 0.04 (-0.08 to 0.15) p=0.53, I2=0.0% p=0.68). Mean IQ was lower in the higher water fluoride groups (high: - 0.52 (-0.92 to -0.12) p=0.01, I2=96.2% p<0.00001, extremely high: -0.60 (-0.87 to -0.33), p<0.0001, I2=84.6% p<0.0001).Conclusions At moderate levels (<1.5 ppm) there was no statistical or clinically meaningful association between water fluoride and IQ. This suggests that populations living in these areas could benefit from artificial water fluoridation without experiencing neurotoxicity. An association between lower mean IQ and high water fluoride observed suggests a need to prioritise removal of excess fluoride from drinking water in these regions.Key Message (3-5 bullet points in complete sentence) At low concentrations of water fluoride (<1.5 ppm) there was no detectable association between water fluoride and intelligence quotient (IQ);At high levels of water fluoride concentrations (>1.5 ppm) there was an inverse association between increasing fluoride concentration and decreasing mean IQ;In countries in which fluoridation of water is considered but kept within safe concentrations, the available evidence suggests that fluoridation has demonstrable benefits on public dental health without any clinically significant effect on IQ.In countries with excessive groundwater fluoride concentrations there is an imperative to promote water de-fluoridation schemes to protect the public from skeletal and dental fluorosis and from possible neurotoxicity."

A self-controlled case series analysis was performed in three commercial insurance databases to compare the risk of seizure in the risk interval (0-1 days) to a control interval (8-63 days).Exposure Receipt of dose 1 and/or dose 2 of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations.Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was febrile seizure (0-1 day risk interval).Analysis A conditional Poisson regression model was used to compare outcome rates in risk and control intervals and estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analyses were used to pool results across databases.Results The primary meta-analysis found a statistically significant increased incidence of febrile seizure, in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 vaccination compared to the control interval (IRR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.35 to 4.69, risk difference (RD)/100,000 doses = 3.22 (95%CI −0.31 to 6.75)). For the BNT162b2 vaccination, the IRR was elevated but not statistically significant (IRR: 1.41, 95%CI: 0.48 to 4.11, RD/100,000 doses = −0.25 (95%CI −2.75 to 2.24).Conclusions and Relevance Among children aged 2-5 years, the analysis showed a small elevated incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures in the 0-1 days following the mRNA-1273 vaccination. Based on the current body of scientific evidence, the safety profile of the monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.Question Among children aged 2-5 years, is the risk of febrile seizure elevated immediately following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination compared with a later period after vaccination?Findings In this self-controlled case series that included participants aged 2-5 years from three commercial insurance databases, the incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures was significantly elevated in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 administration. Absolute risk was small.Meaning The incidence of febrile seizures was elevated immediately following vaccination with the monovalent mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 2-5 years. Based on the current body of evidence, the safety profile of monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children."

The global disparities in immunization access emphasize the urgent need for ongoing research into therapeutic interventions. This study focuses on the potential use of molecular dihydrogen (H2) inhalation as an adjunctive treatment for Covid-19. H2 therapy shows promise in inhibiting intracellular signaling pathways associated with inflammation, particularly when administered early in conjunction with nasal oxygen therapy.Methods This Phase I study, characterized by an open-label, prospective, monocentric, and single ascending dose design, seeks to assess the safety and tolerability of the procedure in individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Employing a 3+3 design, the study includes three exposure durations (target durations): 1 day (D1), 3 days (D2), and 6 days (D3).Results We concluded that the Maximum Tolerated Duration is at least three days. Every patient showed clinical improvement and excellent tolerance to H2 therapy.Discussion/conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this phase 1 clinical trial is the first to establish the safety of inhaling a mixture of H2 (3.6%) and N2 (96.4%) in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The original device and method employed ensure the absence of explosion risk. The encouraging outcomes observed in the 12 patients included in the study justify further exploration through larger, controlled clinical trials.Question What is the Maximum Tolerated Duration of inhalation for a gaseous mixture including 3.6% of molecular dihydrogen in moderate COVID-19 patients?Findings The Maximum Tolerated Duration is at least three days. All patients showed clinical improvement and excellent tolerance to H2 therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this phase 1 clinical trial is the first to establish the safety of inhaling a mixture of H2 (3.6%) and N2 (96.4%) in hospitalized Covid-19 patients.Meaning A gaseous mixture including 3.6% H2, considered in the literature to have promising anti-inflammatory potential, and presenting no risk of explosion, can be used in patients with moderate COVID 19 for at least three days."

These symptoms can negatively impact an affected individual’s health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Herein, we investigate the effects of cognitive function on HRQoL in persons with PCC. Secondarily, we determine whether vortioxetine modulates cognitive function on HRQoL.Methods Participants aged 18-65 years were randomized to receive vortioxetine or placebo for 8 weeks. HRQoL was measured using the World Health organization Wellbeing Scale 5-item, cognition was measured using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and the Trail-Making Test A/B. Generalized estimating equations were used to model the relationship of cognition to HRQoL for each treatment group.Results 147 participants, 75.5% of which were female, were included in the analysis. At baseline, there was a statistically significant positive association between WHO-5 scores and combined DSST z-scores (β = 0.090, 95% CI [0.051, 0.129], p < 0.001), and a statistically significant negative association with TMT-A (β = −0.007, 95% CI [-0.011, −0.003], p < 0.001) and -B (β = −0.002, 95% CI [-0.003, 0.000], p = 0.024) scores, respectively. A significant treatment, time, and combined DSST z-score interaction on changes in overall WHO-5 total score (χ2 = 15.481, p = 0.004) was reported. After adjusting for the type of cognitive test, there was a significant between-group difference (mean change = 1.77, SEM = 0.868, p = 0.042) favoring vortioxetine.Conclusion Cognitive function is significantly associated with HRQoL in persons with PCC where enhanced cognitive functioning is associated with a better HRQoL. Vortioxetine is effective in improving HRQoL through enhancing cognitive function. Cognitive function in persons with PCC provides the impetus for future therapeutic targets for persons with PCC. Future studies should aim to investigate pro-cognitive therapeutic strategies."

Advanced care planning (ACP) plays a crucial role in good death. However, the factors associated with ACP and good death have not been well described.Objective This study aimed to characterize the association between advanced care planning and the outcome of good death in elderly AML patients.Method AML patients aged ≥60, who received less intensive treatment from August 2020 to December 2021, were interviewed and prospectively followed. All clinical data and potential factors related to ACP and good death were collected.Results Seventeen AML patients were included during the study period. The median age was 73 years (range 63-88). Twenty-five patients had passed away, with a median survival of 5.5 months. Thirteen patients had undergone ACP. Among them, twelve patients with ACP had passed away, and all had achieved good death, while six out of fifteen in the non-ACP group had achieved good death (p=0.003). Two-thirds of the ACP group initially expected to live for a year when undergoing ACP but later revised their expectations downward. In the non-ACP group, only two patients who achieved a good death were aware that AML would be the cause of death, whereas five out of six in the non-good death group were not aware of it. However, it was found that prognosis understanding alone did not correlate with successful end-of-life care. No other significant factors associated with patient outcomes were identified. Factors associated with the initiation of ACP discussions included decreased platelet count and increased blast count from baseline. Palliative performance status was not predictive when assessed too late. The median time from palliative consultation to death was 3.5 months, which appeared sufficient for patient preparation.Conclusion The key factor associated with good death was the initiation of ACP discussions with the patient. Decreased platelet count and increased blast count from baseline could serve as warning signs."

COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, cesarean section, fetal dysfunction, preeclampsia, and perinatal death. Additionally, vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from pregnant women to their fetuses has been observed. While severe infections in neonates and infants are rare, newborns can experience serious consequences from COVID-19, despite their suboptimal humoral immune system protection. The amino acids in the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to constant mutation. Since around January 2023, COVID-19, caused by infection with omicron-type SARS-CoV-2 variants, has been prevalent globally. Omicron-type SARS-CoV-2 variants can evade the immune response triggered by traditional mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, such as BNT162b2. Therefore, vaccination with a vaccine (BNT162b2 XBB.1.5) that can provide protection against omicron-type SARS-CoV-2 variants is recommended. Therefore, we examined the titers of anti-spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA in the blood and umbilical cord blood obtained from pregnant women vaccinated with BNT162b2 XBB.1.5. The results showed that anti-spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA titers were highest in the blood and cord blood obtained from pregnant women vaccinated with BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 at late gestational age (28–34 weeks). No serious side effects or adverse events caused by vaccination of pregnant women with BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 were observed in either pregnant women or newborns. In the future, to validate our findings, large cohort clinical studies involving numerous pregnant women must be conducted."

The need for sample collection, shipping, and testing facilities drives up the cost of WBE and hinders its use for rapid detection and isolation in environments with small populations and in low-resource settings. Given the ubiquitousness and regular outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 and various influenza strains, there is a rising need for a low-cost and easy-to-use biosensing platform to detect these viruses locally before outbreaks can occur and monitor their progression. To this end, we have developed an easy-to-use, cost-effective, multiplexed platform able to detect viral loads in wastewater with several orders of magnitude lower limit of detection than mass spectrometry. This is enabled by wafer scale production and aptamers pre-attached with linker molecules, producing forty-four chips at once. Each chip can simultaneously detect four target analytes using twenty transistors segregated into four sets of five for each analyte to allow for immediate statistical analysis. We show our platform’s ability to rapidly detect three virus proteins (SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and Influenza A) and a population normalization molecule (caffeine) in wastewater. Going forward, turning these devices into hand-held systems would enable waste-water epidemiology in low-resource settings and be instrumental for rapid, local outbreak prevention."

The body reacts to these actions by changing OER and consequently VO2i. Understanding the body’s adaptive OER dynamics can elucidate its oxygen consumption goals during CPB and help improve our ability to safely manage the patient’s journey.Methods An autoregressive, integrated time-series model was trained on granular perfusion data from 879 paediatric patients (age: newborn to 18 years old) undergoing 963 CPB operations, with the outcome variable being the minute-by-minute changes in the logit transformation of OER. Variables were cardiac index, haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation of arterial haemoglobin and temperature. An explicit ‘disequilibrium term group’ was also included, proportional to the difference between the logarithm of VO2i and logarithm of a ‘latent’ (i.e. unobserved) oxygen demand - or ‘target’ VO2 (tVO2i) - term, with the logarithm of tVO2i assumed to be a linear function of body temperature (the Van’t Hoff model). The trained time-series models were studied using permutation-based variable importance, deterministic and stochastic simulations, and subgroup analysis by acute kidney injury (AKI) grade and by temperature.Results Model coefficients are consistent with an adaptive OER response to keep VO2i in line with tVO2i, according to body temperature. This adaptation consists of a primary rapid response for 5-10 minutes, and a secondary slow response that is estimated to last up to several hours. The model reproduces the hyperbolic shape of DO2i-VO2i curves - first published in 1982 - as an artefact of insufficient wait times between equilibrium-state transitions. Asymptotically, however, the model converges to a piecewise linear relationship between DO2i and VO2i, with supply-independence of oxygen consumption occurring above a threshold DO2i. Subgroup analysis by temperature suggests that the dependence of tVO2i on temperature (expressed as Q10) may be significantly stronger at low temperatures (< 28C) than at high temperatures (> 28C).Conclusions This study proposes a physiologically plausible model of OER changes during CPB that is consistent with past experimental data. While during CPB, under-oxygenation is the dominant risk in the long term, slow adaptation of OER during CPB creates short-term opportunities for over-oxygenation following significant changes in variables such as cardiac index. The model provides well-defined values for tVO2i at a given temperature, paving the way for further research into the effects of over- and under-oxygenation during CPB on postoperative outcomes such as AKI, and hence improvements in goal-directed perfusion protocols.What Is New?This study is the first to present a data-driven, analytical framework for predicting OER changes in response to clinical interventions during CPB.Changes in the components of oxygen delivery cause an adaptive OER response to keep oxygen consumption in line with oxygen demand, according to body temperature.The dependence of oxygen demand on temperature decreases as temperature increases towards normothermia, inconsistent with the accepted Van’t Hoff equation.Children developing AKI exhibit a dampened response to changes in haemoglobin during CPB, with this dampening of response intensifying with AKI severity.What Are the Clinical Implications?This proposed, dynamic model of OER provides a novel framework for goal-directed perfusion by identifying periods of over- and under-oxygenation.The observed, dampened response to haemoglobin changes in patients that develop AKI can be the foundation of an intraoperative tool for early diagnosis of at-risk patients."

Studies have shown that women are more susceptible than men. This study aims to discover genetic variants associated with neck or shoulder pain through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), using data from 441,757 participants in the UK Biobank. The primary GWAS revealed five significant genetic loci (including two novel) associated with neck or shoulder pain, with the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) being rs9889282 (p = 2.63 x 10-12) near CA10 on chromosome 17. Two novel significant associations were detected on chromosomes 18 and 14, with the top SNPs being rs4608411 (p = 8.20 x 10-9) near TCF4 and rs370565192 (p = 3.80 x 10-8) in DCAF5, respectively. The female-specific GWAS identified two significant loci including one near CA10 and one near LINC02770 on chromosome 1 with the top SNP being rs5779595 (p = 3.57 x 10-8). The male-specific GWAS identified one locus in SLC24A3 on chromosome 20 with the top SNP being rs16980973 (p = 6.52 x 10-9). The tissue expression analysis revealed a significant association between brain tissues and neck or shoulder pain. In summary, this study has identified novel genetic variants for neck or shoulder pain. Sex stratified GWAS also suggested that gender played a role in the occurrence of the phenotype."

Despite understanding the important role of inflammation in morbidity following SAH, there is no current effective way to modulate this deleterious response. There is a critical need for a novel approach to immunomodulation that can be safely, rapidly, and effectively deployed in SAH patients. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) provides a non-pharmacologic approach to immunomodulation, with prior studies demonstrating VNS can reduce systemic inflammatory markers, and VNS has had early success treating inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, sepsis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of the Non-invasive Auricular Vagus nerve stimulation for Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (NAVSaH) trial is to translate the use of non-invasive transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) to spontaneous SAH, with our central hypothesis being that implementing taVNS in the acute period following spontaneous SAH attenuates the expected inflammatory response to hemorrhage and curtails morbidity associated with inflammatory-mediated clinical endpoints.Materials and methods The overall objectives for the NAHSaH trial are to 1) Define the impact that taVNS has on SAH-induced inflammatory markers in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 2) Determine whether taVNS following SAH reduces radiographic vasospasm, and 3) Determine whether taVNS following SAH reduces chronic hydrocephalus. Following presentation to a single enrollment site, enrolled SAH patients are randomly assigned twice daily treatment with either taVNS or sham stimulation for the duration of their intensive care unit stay. Blood and CSF are drawn before initiation of treatment sessions, and then every three days during a patient’s hospital stay. Primary endpoints include change in the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid between day 1 and day 13, rate of radiographic vasospasm, and rate of requirement for long-term CSF diversion via a ventricular shunt. Secondary outcomes include exploratory analyses of a panel of additional cytokines, number and type of hospitalized acquired infections, duration of external ventricular drain in days, interventions required for vasospasm, continuous physiology data before, during, and after treatment sessions, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, and modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) at admission, discharge, and each at follow-up appointment for up to two years following SAH.Discussion Inflammation plays a central role in morbidity following SAH. This NAVSaH trial is innovative because it diverges from the pharmacologic status quo by harnessing a novel non-invasive neuromodulatory approach and its known anti-inflammatory effects to alter the pathophysiology of SAH. The investigation of a new, effective, and rapidly deployable intervention in SAH offers a new route to improve outcomes following SAH.Trial registration Clinical Trials Registered, NCT04557618.

We investigated the association between (time since) SARS-COV-2 infection and health outcomes: HRQoL (health utility (SF-6D); physical health and mental health (both SF-12)) and fatigue (CIS-fatigue) using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, educational level, number of comorbidities, COVID-19 vaccination status, and the intensity of restrictions. For each outcome, multivariable logistic regression models were fitted at cut-off points selected based on the cumulative distribution of those uninfected.Results Results shown correspond to the cut-off point related to the worst off 15% of each outcome. Significant differences between those uninfected (n=4,614) and cases infected ≤4 months ago (n=368) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (OR [95%CI]: 1.7 [1.3-2.3]) and fatigue (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.0]), but not for mental health. There were no significant differences between uninfected and cases infected >4 months ago (n=345) for all outcomes.Conclusions In a Dutch population-based cohort of seroconverted individuals, those infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 ≤4 months ago more often reported poor health utility and physical health and were more often severely fatigued compared to those uninfected (at the 15% cut-off). HRQoL and fatigue remained below the detection limit for those infected >4 months ago, suggesting a relatively low prevalence of PCC."

The minimal sacral vertebral tilt(Smin), maximal thoracolumbar vertebral tilt(TLmax), and minimal thoracic vertebral tilt (Tmin) were recorded. The concept of lumbosacral lordosis (LSL) was introduced, and the Ferguson method was utilized to measure sagittal spinal parameters both in anatomical segmentation (Ferguson L1-S2, Ferguson T1-T12) and functional segmentation (Ferguson LSLmax, Ferguson TKmax). The subjects were grouped based on pelvic incidence (PI) and TLmax separately, and the mean and standard deviation of each parameter were calculated. Chi-square tests were conducted for statistical analysis.Results 1. Based on PI grouping: PI for all subjects was 45.4 ± 9.5° (21.7-86.4°). Group A consisted of 117 subjects with a mean PI of 34.7 ± 4.4°, Group B had 158 subjects with a mean PI of 45.2 ± 2.9°, and Group C included 113 subjects with a mean PI of 56.7 ± 5.8°. No statistically significant differences were found in tilt of S2, L1, T1, TLmax, Tmin, and Ferguson L1-S2, Ferguson T1-T12, and Ferguson TKmax among Groups A, B, and C. 2. Based on TLmax grouping: TLmax for all subjects was 110.5 ± 5.5° (94.4-132.0°). Group A had 91 subjects with a mean TLmax of 104.0 ± 2.3°, Group B comprised 216 subjects with a mean TLmax of 110.2 ± 2.1°, and Group C included 81 subjects with a mean TLmax of 118.6 ± 3.8°. Significant statistical differences were observed in tilt of S2, L1, T1, Smin, TLmax, Tmin, and Ferguson L1-S2, Ferguson T1-T12, Ferguson LSLmax, and Ferguson TKmax among Groups A, B, and C.Conclusion There were no differences in the magnitude of LSL and TK among subjects with different PI, indicating that PI does not affect the overall curvature of the “S” curve in the sagittal spinal aligment. In contrast, TLmax effectively distinguishes the overall curvature of the “S” curve."

The clinical data and plasma samples were collected from PAH patients and controls and plasma coagulation cascade in subject was quantified by both immunoassay and proteomic approach.Results RNA sequencing analysis of lung tissues in two PAH models showed the reduced anticoagulants and intrinsic clotting factors and increased tissue factor (TF) expression. The immunoassay assessment of coagulation cascade in PAH models revealed increased TF expression, reduced intrinsic and common clotting factors and decreased anticoagulants antithrombin (AT)-Ⅲ in the peripheral circulation. Additionally, clinical evaluation of hemostatic parameters in PAH patients demonstrated hemostatic deficiency and lower AT-Ⅲ activity. Consistently, proteomic and immunoassay analysis of coagulation cascade in PAH patients revealed the increased extrinsic clotting factors, impairment of intrinsic and common pathways and impairment of AT-Ⅲ anticoagulant pathway.Conclusions The activation of extrinsic pathway and impairment of heparin/AT-Ⅲ anticoagulant system are conserved mechanisms for thrombosis across rat and human PAH, restoring its function with heparin supplementation may be a better option for future anticoagulant therapy.Clinical Perspective What Is New?
The activation of extrinsic pathway and impairment of heparin/AT-Ⅲ system were responsible for thrombosis in pulmonary arterial hypertension.Impairment of intrinsic and common pathways, due to reduced plasma levels of clotting factors F10, F11, F2 and vWF, contributed to hemorrhagic complications, such as hemoptysis in PAH patients.What Are the Clinical Implications?
Increased risk of bleeding for anticoagulation with warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants may be attributed to further impairment of intrinsic and common pathways in PAH.Restoring function of heparin/ AT-Ⅲ anticoagulant system with heparin supplementation may be a better option for future anticoagulant therapy."

Cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, are implicated in clinical and subclinical brain injuries. Even in the absence of a clinical diagnosis, subclinical or prodromal substrates of arrhythmias, including an abnormally long or short P-wave duration (PWD), a measure associated with atrial abnormalities, have been associated with stroke and cognitive decline. However, the extent to which PWD has subclinical influences on overall aging patterns of the brain is not clearly understood. Here, using neuroimaging and ECG data from the UK Biobank, we use a novel regional “brain age” method to identify the brain aging networks associated with abnormal PWD. We find that PWD is inversely associated with accelerated brain aging in the sensorimotor, frontoparietal, ventral attention, and dorsal attention networks, even in the absence of overt cardiac diseases. These findings suggest that detrimental aging outcomes may result from subclinically abnormal PWD."

Given its potential link to dementia and reversible characteristics, this study aims to understand the national-level prevalence of CF, its regional variations, and its holistic association with socio-demographic, physical, psychosocial, and lifestyle factors. Methods: The present study employed data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI-Wave-I), a nationally representative survey that included 27,379 individuals (13,293 men and 14,086 women) aged 60+. CF was defined as the presence of both PF and CI without dementia. PF was assessed using the modified Community-Oriented Frailty Index, comprising a 20-item deficits frailty index. CI was evaluated using the composite score, which considered five cognitive domains and seven difficulties with IADL. To investigate the association between the outcome variable (CF) and predictor variables (socio-demographic, physical, psychosocial, and lifestyle factors), the study utilised stepwise binary logistic regression (backward elimination) and presented the results as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Results: The overall prevalence of CF amongst those aged 60+ was found to be 4.5%, with higher rates evident in the Western (6.2%) and Southern (5.3%) regions. Several factors exhibited significant associations with CF (p < 0.01), including being aged 80 and above (AOR 4.7, 95% CI: 3.9–5.6), being female (AOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.4–1.9), and having less than primary education (AOR 15.3, 95% CI: 7.2–32.5, p < 0.01). Mobility impairment (AOR 6.7, 95% CI: 4.7–9.8) also exhibited a strong effect on CF. Psychosocial factors, such as low social participation (AOR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.8–2.4), major depression (AOR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.4–2.0), sleep problems (AOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.4–1.9), and low life satisfaction (AOR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2–1.6), were also found to have significant associations with CF. Conclusions: This pioneering study outlines the prevalence of CF in India, revealing elevated rates among the community-dwelling population aged over 60 compared to global figures, accompanied by notable regional variations, and underscores the importance of future longitudinal data and targeted investigations for informing policy implications."

We have previously shown that circulating levels of angiopoietin-2 increased in critically ill COVID-19 patients correlated to kidney injury, coagulopathy, and mortality. Furthermore, our experiments showed a causal effect on coagulopathy from angiopoietin-2 binding and inhibition of thrombomodulin mediated anticoagulation. In the current study we hypothesize that renal microthrombi may be a mechanism for reduced renal function in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and that local dysregulation of thrombomodulin and angiopoietin-2 may be involved.To investigate our hypothesis, we utilized postmortem kidney tissue from seven COVID-19 patients treated at the intensive care unit. We evaluated kidney function, thrombosis, tubular injury, fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, glomerular size as well as renal expression of thrombomodulin and angiopoietin-2. Proximity ligation assay was utilized to evaluate the presence of angiopoietin-2 binding to thrombomodulin. Normal kidney tissue came from the healthy part of six nephrectomies due to cancer.Our experiments show renal thrombosis in 6/7 COVID-19 patients, on average 14.7 (6.9-22.5) thrombi per mm2. Most COVID-19 kidneys had extensive kidney injury, especially tubular necrosis, but also glomerular enlargement, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis which in some cases most likely resulted from underlying disease. Thrombomodulin expression was reduced in glomeruli and peritubular capillaries in kidneys from COVID-19 patients, whereas no change was found for angiopoietin-2.In summary, our study describes a high degree of acute renal failure, renal microthrombosis, and loss of thrombomodulin in postmortem tissue from critically ill COVID-19 patients."

The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess incidence of silent cerebral microembolization detected by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) following these procedures.Methods A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane databases including comparative studies involving symptomatic or asymptomatic patients undergoing either CEA or CAS, and reporting on new cerebral ischemic lesions in post-operative MRI. The primary outcome was the newly detected cerebral ischemic lesions. Pooled effect estimates for all outcomes were calculated using the random-effects model. Pre-specified random effects meta-regression and subgroup analysis were conducted to examine the impact of moderator variables on the presence of new cerebral ischemic lesions.Results 25 studies reporting on total 1827 CEA and 1500 CAS interventions fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The incidence of new cerebral ischemic lesions was significantly lower after CEA comparing to CAS, regardless of the time of MRI assessment (first 24 hours; OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17-0.64, p<0.001), (the first 72 hours, OR: 0.25, 95% CI 0.18-0.36, p<0.001), (generally within a week after the operation; OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.17-0.34, p<0.001). Also, the rate of stroke (OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.23-0.63, p<0.001) and the presence of contralateral new cerebral ischemic lesions (OR: 0.16, 95% CI 0.08-0.32, p<0.001) were less frequent after CEA. Subgroup analysis based on the study design and the use of embolic protection device during CAS showed consistently lower rates of new lesions after CEA.Conclusions CEA demonstrates significant lower rates of new silent cerebral microembolization, as detected by MRI in postoperative period, compared to CAS."

Mpox health activism negatively correlated with LGB social climate index at U.S. state level, ρ = -0.322, p = 0.031.Conclusions SMMGD discussions on mpox encompassed utilitarian (e.g., vaccine access, case reports, mpox symptoms) and emotionally-charged themes—advocating against homophobia, misinformation, and stigma. Mpox health activism was more prevalent in states with lower LGB social acceptance.Public Health Implications Findings illuminate SMMGD engagement with mpox discourse, underscoring the need for more inclusive health communication strategies in infectious disease outbreaks to control associated stigma."

This study aimed to measure the prevalence of short birth intervals and identify their associated factors in a semi-urban setting in Burkina Faso. We conducted a cross-sectional study in which data were collected in households between May and October 2022. The dependent variable was the short birth interval (SBI), defined by the World Health Organization as the time between two live births. We performed a multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression with robust variance to determine the factors associated with the SBI by reporting adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 5544 birth intervals were recorded from 4067 women. A short birth interval was found in 1503 cases out of 5544, i.e., a frequency of 27.1%. The prevalence of short birth interval (time between two live births less than 33 months) was higher in never users of modern contraceptive users (aPR=1.24; 95% CI [1.14-1.34] vs. previous users), in younger ages with aPR of 4.21 (95% CI [3.30-5.37]), 2.47 (95% CI [1.96-3.11]), and 1.45 (95% CI [1.16-1.81]), respectively for under 18, 18-24 years old, and 25-34 years old, compared to 35 and over. Childbirths occurring before the implementation of the maternal and infant free health care policy (aPR=2.13; 95% CI [1.98-2.30]) and also before the free FP policy (aPR=1.53; 95% CI [1.28-1.81]) were found also protective against SBI. Women with low socio-economic positions were more likely to have SBI. This study found a high SBI in Burkina Faso (more than one woman out of four). Our results have programmatic implications, as some factors, such as contraceptive practice and socioeconomic status, are modifiable. These factors need particular attention to lengthen birth intervals and, in turn, improve mother-child couple health by reducing short birth interval consequences."

It is unknown whether those findings generalize to real-world conditions such as community-based treatment, which is marked by intermittent exposure and polypharmacy. To fill this gap, we capitalized on the observational design of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to examine effects of stimulant exposure on modulation of large-scale bilateral cortical networks’ resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with 6 striatal regions (left and right caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens) across two years in children with ADHD. Out of 11,878 children, 179 met criteria for an ADHD diagnosis at baseline and high-quality imaging data at baseline and the two-year timepoint. Bayesian hierarchical logistic regressions revealed that change in rs-FC over the two-year period of multiple striatal-cortical networks associated with executive functions and a visuo-motor network predicted stimulant exposure. These networks did not overlap with those that predicted non-stimulant exposure. Of these networks, change selective to stimulant exposure was limited to rs-FC with the putamen, specifically frontoparietal and visual networks, implicating motor control. 23% of stimulant-exposed children did not meet criterion for ADHD at the two-year timepoint, and they were distinguished by change in rs-FC between left putamen and frontoparietal network. Thus, while stimulant exposure for a two-year period under real-world conditions modulated striatal-cortical functional networks broadly, therapeutic effects of that exposure were limited in scale, to network connections relevant to motor control in a small subset of children."

However, the textured type, which is one of the shell types of breast implants, has been identified as a possible carcinogenic factor for lymphoma, specifically breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). Identifying the texture type of the implant is critical to the diagnosis of BIA-ALCL. However, distinguishing the shell type can be difficult due to human memory or loss of medical history. An alternative approach is to use ultrasonography, but this method also has limitations in quantitative assessment.Objective The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of using a deep learning model to classify the textured shell type of breast implants and make robust predictions from ultrasonography images from heterogeneous sources.Methods A total of 19,502 breast implant images were retrospectively collected from heterogeneous sources, including images from both Canon (D1) and GE (D2), images of ruptured implants (D3), and images without implants (D4), as well as publicly available images (D5). The Canon (D1) images were trained using Resnet-50. The performance of the model on D1 was evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Additionally, external validation was conducted using D2 and D5. The AUROC and PRAUC were calculated based on the contribution of the pixels with Grad-CAM. To identify the significant pixels for classification, we masked the pixels that contributed less than 10%, up to a maximum of 100%. To assess model robustness to uncertainty, Shannon entropy was calculated for four image groups: Canon (D1), GE (D2), ruptured implant (D3), and without implants (D5).Result The deep learning model achieved an average AUROC of 0.98 and a PRAUC of 0.88 in the Canon dataset (D1). For images captured with GE (D2), the model achieved an AUROC of 0.985 and a PRAUC of 0.748. Additionally, the model predicted an AUROC of 0.909 and a PRAUC of 0.958 for a dataset available online. For quantitative validation, this model maintained PRAUC up to 90% masking of less contributing pixels, and the remnant pixels located in breast shell layers. Furthermore, the prediction uncertainty increased in the following order: Canon (D1), GE (D2), ruptured implant (D3), no implant (D5) (0.066; 0072; 0.371; 0.777, respectively).Conclusion We have demonstrated the feasibility of using deep learning to predict the shell types of breast implants. With this approach, the textured shell types of breast implants can be quantified, supporting the first step in the diagnosis of BIA-ALCL."

However, LSI may lack accuracy in individuals with ACLR and ankle sprains, as it overlooks kinetic chain coordination across lower limb joints. Previous ankle sprains (AS) contribute to altered neuromuscular control in ACLR, emphasizing the need to evaluate within-limb coordination during bilateral tasks to prevent secondary ACL injuries. The effect of Energy Absorption Contribution (EAC) on joint work provides insight into the coordination between joints during observed movements. Thus, the purpose of this study was to validate a novel LSI based on EAC for discriminating movement strategies in bilateral drop vertical jump landing (DVJL) among individuals with ACLR and ACLR-ASMETHODS 39 healthy athletes, including 13 healthy controls, 13 ACLR, and 13 ACLR-AS were matched by age, height, weight, sex, sports involvement, and limb dominance. Participants performed five DVJLs with kinematics and ground reaction forces recorded. Individual joint work (M) and EAC were calculated and averaged across the middle three trials to compute the LSI on individual joint work (LSIM) and EAC (LSIEAC). Negative LSI indicates asymmetry toward the nonsurgical limb, while positive LSI indicates asymmetry toward the surgical limb. A 3x2x3 repeated measures analysis of variance was utilized to analyze interactions between groups, the LSI method, and joint. Tukey’s LSD post-hoc analyses were used to examine within and between groups (alpha=0.05).RESULTS There was a significant interaction between the group, LSI method, and joint (F4,72=3.216, P=.017). LSIEAC identified significant loading asymmetry at the hip (P=.046) and knee (P=.015) when compared to healthy controls.CONCLUSIONS LSIEAC proved to be the method capable of distinguishing group differences in loading asymmetry at the hip and knee for the ACLR-AS group compared to healthy controls during bilateral DVJL. Overall, LSIEAC provided a more comprehensive insight into the movement strategies employed during DVJL, particularly for individuals with ACLR and ACLR-AS. This emphasizes its suitability for effectively monitoring the rehabilitation progression post ACLR towards RTS. Our findings suggest that clinicians should prioritize computing the LSI based on EAC and assessing the history of ankle sprains for precise RTS decision-making. This approach not only aids in identifying loading asymmetry at the knee and hip but also underscores the critical importance of restoring modified movement strategies in adolescents with ACLR-AS, ultimately reducing the risk of secondary ACL injury following RTS."

We deployed a validated AI model of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) to ECG images (≥0.1, positive screen) and explored its association with i) global longitudinal strain (GLS) measured within 15 days (n=7,271 pairs); ii) future CTRCD (new cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]<50%), and LVEF<40%. In the ICI cohort we correlated baseline AI-ECG-LVSD predictions with downstream myocarditis.Results Higher AI-ECG LVSD predictions were associated with worse GLS (−18% [IQR:-20 to −17%] for predictions<0.1, to −12% [IQR:-15 to −9%] for ≥0.5 (p<0.001)). In 1,308 patients receiving AC/TZM (age 59 [IQR:49-67] years, 999 [76.4%] women, 80 [IQR:42-115] follow-up months) a positive baseline AI-ECG LVSD screen was associated with ∼2-fold and ∼4.8-fold increase in the incidence of the composite CTRCD endpoint (adj.HR 2.22 [95%CI:1.63-3.02]), and LVEF<40% (adj.HR 4.76 [95%CI:2.62-8.66]), respectively. Among 2,056 patients receiving ICI (age 65 [IQR:57-73] years, 913 [44.4%] women, follow-up 63 [IQR:28-99] months) AI-ECG predictions were not associated with ICI myocarditis (adj.HR 1.36 [95%CI:0.47-3.93]).Conclusion AI applied to baseline ECG images can stratify the risk of CTRCD associated with anthracycline or trastuzumab exposure.CONDENSED ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for scalable and affordable biomarkers to stratify the risk of cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD). In this hospital system-based, decade-long cohort of patients without cardiomyopathy receiving anthracyclines or trastuzumab, a validated artificial intelligence algorithm applied to baseline electrocardiographic (AI-ECG) images identified individuals with a 2-fold and 4.8-fold risk of developing any cardiomyopathy or left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, respectively.

Developing such computational systems must also overcome the cold-start problem related to the inevitable scarce early data and extant knowledge regarding a novel pathogen’s transmissibility and virulence, while addressing changing population behavior and policy options as a pandemic evolves. Here, we describe how we have coupled advances in the construction of digital or virtual models of real-world cities with an agile, modular, agent-based model of viral transmission and data from navigation and social media interactions, to overcome these challenges in order to provide a new simulation tool, CitySEIRCast, that can model viral spread at the sub-national level. Our data pipelines and workflows are designed purposefully to be flexible and scalable so that we can implement the system on hybrid cloud/cluster systems and be agile enough to address different population settings and indeed, diseases. Our simulation results demonstrate that CitySEIRCast can provide the timely high resolution spatio-temporal epidemic predictions required for supporting situational awareness of the state of a pandemic as well as for facilitating assessments of vulnerable sub-populations and locations and evaluations of the impacts of implemented interventions, inclusive of the effects of population behavioral response to fluctuations in case incidence. This work arose in response to requests from county agencies to support their work on COVID-19 monitoring, risk assessment, and planning, and using the described workflows, we were able to provide uninterrupted bi-weekly simulations to guide their efforts for over a year from late 2021 to 2023. We discuss future work that can significantly improve the scalability and real-time application of this digital city-based epidemic modelling system, such that validated predictions and forecasts of the paths that may followed by a contagion both over time and space can be used to anticipate the spread dynamics, risky groups and regions, and options for responding effectively to a complex epidemic."

This suggests that it may be possible to develop speech analysis algorithms that can quantify ASD symptom severity from speech recordings in a direct and objective manner. Here we demonstrate the utility of a new open-source AI algorithm, ASDSpeech, which can analyze speech recordings of ASD children and reliably quantify their social communication difficulties across multiple developmental timepoints. The algorithm was trained and tested on the largest ASD speech dataset available to date, which contained 99,193 vocalizations from 197 ASD children recorded in 258 Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd edition (ADOS-2) assessments. ASDSpeech was trained with acoustic and conversational features extracted from the speech recordings of 136 children, who participated in a single ADOS-2 assessment, and tested with independent recordings of 61 additional children who completed two ADOS-2 assessments, separated by 1–2 years. Estimated total ADOS-2 scores in the test set were significantly correlated with actual scores when examining either the first (r(59) = 0.544, P < 0.0001) or second (r(59) = 0.605, P < 0.0001) assessment. Separate estimation of social communication and restricted and repetitive behavior symptoms revealed that ASDSpeech was particularly accurate at estimating social communication symptoms (i.e., ADOS-2 social affect scores). These results demonstrate the potential utility of ASDSpeech for enhancing basic and clinical ASD research as well as clinical management. We openly share both algorithm and speech feature dataset for use and further development by the community."

Prostate cancer was chosen as a use-case for this study. We collected more than 1.8 million clinical notes and radiology and pathology reports for 15341 patients treated for prostate cancer in Mayo Clinic across three sites and outpatient clinics. In addition to domain-specific training data, we built domain-specific tokenizers and devised knowledge-guided training strategies for LLM development. During the self-supervised training, LLM was forced to predict domain-specific information by marking clinical terms using UMLS parser. We evaluated the model for downstream tasks of clinical information prediction and question answering using quantitative and user evaluation study to measure the accuracy, reliability and information completeness. We compared the domain-specific model against similarly sized general purpose model GPT-2 and a three-times larger domain specialized model. i.e., BioGPT. Our model outperformed GPT-2 on both tasks by a wide margin. Our model was also able to outperform BioGPT on clinical information prediction tasks and showed some advantages over BioGPT in question-answering tasks."

Previous research has identified associations between healthy eating patterns and both cardiovascular and brain health, although there is little evidence specifically focusing on the Eatwell Guide. To date no research has investigated associations between the Eatwell Guide and risk for future dementia.Methods Data from the PREVENT dementia cohort study baseline visit was used in this analysis. Binary and graded Eatwell Guide scores (BEWG, GEWG) were created from a self-reported Food Frequency Questionnaire. The CAIDE score was included as the primary outcome measure to represent risk for future Alzheimer’s disease. Secondary outcome measures included cardiometabolic health measures and brain health measures. Generalised additive models were run in R.Results A total of 517 participants were included in the analysis, with a mean BEWG score of 4.39 (± 1.66) (out of a possible 12 points) and GEWG score of 39.88 (± 6.19) (out of a possible 60 points). There was no significant association between either Eatwell Guide score and the CAIDE score (BEWG β: 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.07, 0.22; GEWG β: 0.02, 95% CI: - 0.02, 0.06) or any measures of brain health. There was a significant association between higher GEWG score and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) (systolic β: −0.24, 95% CI: −0.45, −0.03; diastolic β: −0.16, 95% CI: −0.29, −0.03; BMI β: −0.09, 95% CI: −0.16, −0.01).Conclusions Although not directly associated with the CAIDE score, the Eatwell Guide dietary pattern may be beneficial for dementia prevention efforts through the modification of hypertension and obesity, which are both known risk factors for dementia. Future work could replicate these findings in other UK-based cohorts as well as further development of Eatwell Guide scoring methodologies."

Adherence to HWE, using a p-value filter, is used as a quality control measure to remove potential genotyping errors prior to certain analyses. Larger sample sizes increase power to differentiate smaller effect sizes, but will also affect methods of quality control. Here, we test the effects of current methods of HWE QC filtering on varying sample sizes up to 486,178 subjects for imputed and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) genotypes using data from the UK Biobank and propose potential alternative filtering methods.METHODS Simulations were performed on imputed genotype data using chromosome 1. WES GWAS (Genome Wide Association Study) was performed using PLINK2.RESULTS Our simulations on the imputed data from Chromosome 1 show a progressive increase in the number of SNPs eliminated from analysis as sample sizes increase. As the HWE p-value filter remains constant at p<1e-15, the number of SNPs removed increases from 1.66% at n=10,000 to 18.86% at n=486,178 in a multi-ancestry cohort and from 0.002% at n=10,000 to 0.334% at n=300,000 in a European ancestry cohort. Greater reductions are shown in WES analysis with a 11.91% reduction in analyzed SNPs in a European ancestry cohort n=362,192, and a 32.70% reduction in SNPs in a multi-ancestry dataset n=463,605. Using a sample size specific HWE p-value cutoff removes ∼ 2.25% of SNPs in the all ancestry cohort across all sample sizes, but does not currently scale beyond 300,000 samples. A hard cutoff of +/- 20% deviation from HWE produces the most consistent results and scales across all sample sizes but requires additional user steps.CONCLUSION Testing for deviance from HWE may still be an important quality control step in GWAS studies, however we demonstrate here that using an HWE p-value threshold that is acceptable for smaller sample sizes will be inappropriate for large sample studies due to an unnecessarily high number of variants removed prior to analysis. Rather than exclude variants that fail HWE prior to analysis it may be better to include all variants in the analysis and examine their deviation from HWE afterward. We believe that adjusting the cutoffs will be even more important for large whole genome sequencing results and more diverse population studies.KEY TAKEAWAYSCurrent thresholds for assessing HWE are impractical for large sample sizes.Filtering imputed datasets for HWE regardless of sample size is unnecessary and in fact detrimental if you have a diverse, mixed, or unknown ancestry cohort.WES data shows more distributed deviation from HWE for all Minor Allele Frequencies (MAF).We present an alternative p-value filter for HWE for large sample sizes.We recommend that all genotype data (imputed, WES or WGS) should be analyzed, HWE computed, results combined, and then filtered post-hoc."

Evidence is lacking for the current >20 mmHg peak-to-peak blood pressure gradient (BPGpp) guideline, which can cause aortic thickening, stiffening and dysfunction. This study sought to find the BPGpp severity and duration that avoid persistent dysfunction in a preclinical model, and test if predictors translate to HTN status in CoA patients.Methods Rabbits (N=75; 5-12/group) were exposed to mild, intermediate or severe CoA (≤12, 13-19, ≥20 mmHg BPGpp) for ∼1, 3 or 22 weeks using dissolvable and permanent sutures with thickening, stiffening, contraction and endothelial function evaluated via multivariate regression. Relevance to CoA patients (N=239; age=0.01-46 years; median 3.7 months) was tested by retrospective review of predictors (pre-operative BPGpp, surgical age, etc.) vs follow-up HTN status.Results CoA duration and severity were predictive of aortic remodeling and active dysfunction in rabbits, and HTN in CoA patients. Interaction between patient age and BPGpp at surgery contributed significantly to HTN, similar to rabbits, suggesting preclinical findings translate to patients. Machine learning decision tree analysis uncovered that pre-operative BPGpp and surgical age predict risk of HTN along with residual post-operative BPGpp.Conclusions These findings suggest the current BPGpp threshold determined decades ago is likely too high to prevent adverse coarctation-induced aortic remodeling. The results and decision tree analysis provide a foundation for revising CoA treatment guidelines considering the interaction between CoA severity and duration to limit the risk of HTN."

We conducted whole exome sequencing on 14 participants (12 families) from an Indian cohort. Our analysis revealed a spectrum of genetic variants, predominantly in the PKD1. These in PKD1 included missense variants such as p.Glu2937Lys (c.8809G>A) and p.Gly2310Arg (c.6928G>A), p.Asp2095Gly (c.6284A>G), p.Thr938Met (c.2813C>T), p.Trp967Arg (c.2899T>C), p.Glu593* (c.1777G>T), frameshift variants p.Gln149fs*141 (c.445delC), p.Ser3305fs*84 (c.9914_9915delCT), p.His1347fs*83 (c.4041_4042delCA), and p.Leu2776fs*87(c.8327_8363delTGGCGGGCGAGGAGATCGTGGCCCAGGGCAAGCGCTC), intronic splice site variant c.8017-3C>G, nonsense variant p.Glu593* (c.1777G>T) and in PKD2 missense variant p.Ser370Asn (c.1109G>A). While one individual carried intronic (c.2358+5G>A) and 3’UTR (c.*174G>T) variants in PKD2 only another individual carried variants in both PKD1 and PKD2, suggesting potential genetic complexity. Clinical data revealed diverse presentations. Age at diagnosis varied widely. Patients with frameshift variants exhibited earlier onset and severe manifestations, including bilateral ADPKD. One proband had right unilateral ADPKD. Involvement of liver, a common extra-renal manifestation, was also observed. Heterogeneity at phenotypic and at allelic level was observed in our cohort. In this study, using WES of a trio, a frameshift-truncation deletion [c.32del/p.Leu11ArgfsTer61] in MIOX was found to be associated with the disease shared by both the affected and early diagnosed mother and daughter carrying PKD1 missense variant, which had not been previously reported in ADPKD. Further, differential gene expression analysis using data from GEO database showed reduced MIOX expression in ADPKD cystic samples compared to minimal cystic tissues and controls. MIOX is an enzyme specific to renal tubules and catalyses the initial step of the kidney-based myoinositol catabolism. Both affected candidates also shared benign variants and other variations of uncertain significance which may influence the disease development. Further functional analysis will clarify how MIOX contributes to the disease. The study limitations include the small sample size and the need for validation in larger cohorts. Our findings highlight the importance of genetic analysis in ADPKD management especially to facilitate personalized therapeutic strategies.HighlightsIdentified variants in PKD1 and PKD2 through whole exome sequencing in ADPKD patients, affecting different protein regions.Variants include non-synonymous coding changes, frame-shift deletions, and splice site alterations.Clinical features and age at diagnosis varied widely, with common symptoms including flank pain, fatigue.Frameshift deletion in MIOX, associated in one PKD1 trio, implicates its role in ADPKD pathogenesis.DGE analysis of dataset from database reveals downregulation of MIOX in ADPKD tissue samples highlighting its role in potential molecular pathways in ADPKD progression.Download figureOpen in new tab"

The goal of the present study was to identify and characterize the presence and characteristics of chronic pain in SM and GM persons using data from The PRIDE Study, which is the first large-scale, long-term national cohort health study of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or as another sexual or gender minority person. A total of 6189 adult participants completed The PRIDE Study 2022 Annual Questionnaire at the time of data analysis. A total of 2462 participants reported no chronic pain, leaving 2935 participants who reported experiencing chronic pain. The findings from this study highlight that chronic pain is present to a significant degree in sexual and gender minority adults who participated in The PRIDE Study with chronic spine pain being the most common location/region of pain. Notably, more than one-third of non-binary persons, transgender men, and people who selected another gender experienced chronic widespread pain, defined by having 3 or more total regions of chronic pain. The lowest prevalence of chronic widespread pain was among transgender women and cisgender men. When considering sexual orientation, the highest prevalence of widespread pain was in participants who selected another sexual orientation, followed by queer and asexual, demisexual, gray ace, with the lowest prevalence of chronic widespread pain being in those who identify as straight or heterosexual, bisexual, pansexual, gay, and lesbian. Future studies are planned to elucidate how a variety of biopsychosocial mechanisms may influence chronic pain in sexual and gender minority persons."

However, applicability to patient groups excluded from trials remains unknown. Real-world patient data provides an opportunity to evaluate outcomes in a trial analogous population of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) users and in patients otherwise excluded from RCTs, however there remains uncertainty on the validity of the methods and suitability of the data.Successful reference trial emulation can support the generation of evidence around treatment effects in groups excluded or underrepresented in the original trials.We used linked UK primary care data to investigate whether we could emulate the pivotal ARISTOTLE trial (apixaban vs warfarin) and extend the analysis to investigate the impact of warfarin time in therapeutic range (TTR) on results.Methods and findings Patients with AF in a UK primary care database Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD Aurum) prescribed apixaban or warfarin from 1 Jan 2013 to 31 Jul 2019 were selected. ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria were applied to this population and matched to the RCT apixaban arm on baseline characteristics creating a trial-analogous apixaban cohort; this was propensity-score matched to warfarin users in the CPRD Aurum. ARISTOTLE outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression stratified by prior warfarin exposure status during 2.5 years of patient follow-up and results benchmarked against the trial results before treatment effectiveness was further evaluated based on (warfarin) time in therapeutic range (TTR).The analysis sample comprised 8734 apixaban users and propensity-score matched 8734 warfarin users in CPRD. Results [Hazard Ratio (95% Confidence Interval)] confirmed apixaban non-inferiority for stroke or systemic embolism (SE) [CPRD 0.98 (0.82,1.19) vs trial 0.79 (0.66,0.95)] and death from any cause [CPRD 1.03 (0.93,1.14) vs trial 0.89 (0.80,0.998)] but did not indicate apixaban superiority. Absolute event rates for Stroke/SE were similar for apixaban in CPRD Aurum and ARISTOTLE (1.27%/year) whereas a lower event rate was observed for warfarin (CPRD Aurum 1.29%/year, ARISTOTLE 1.60%/year)Analysis by TTR suggested non-inferiority of apixaban in those with TTR < 0.75 [Stroke/SE 0.94 (0.75,1.19), all-cause death 0.99 (0.87,1.12)]. However, apixaban was associated with increased hazards compared with well-controlled warfarin treatment (TTR ≥ 0.75) [Stroke/SE 1.49 (1.13,1.97), all-cause death 1.75 (1.49,2.06)]. The main limitation of the study’s methodology are the risk of residual confounding, channelling bias and attrition bias in the warfarin arm.Conclusions Analysis of non-interventional data generated results demonstrating non-inferiority of apixaban vs warfarin consistent with the pre-specified benchmarking criteria. Unlike in ARISTOTLE superiority of apixaban vs warfarin was not seen which may be linked to the lower proportion of Asian patients and higher proportion of patients with well-controlled warfarin compared to ARISTOTLE. The methodological template developed can be used to investigate treatment effects of oral anticoagulants in patient groups excluded from or under-represented in trials and also provides a framework which can be adapted to investigate treatment effects for other conditions.Why Was This Study Done?Stroke prevention treatment guidelines for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are based on results from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we do not know if these results are relevant to patients that would not have been eligible to be included in the RCTs.This study used routinely collected health data from the UK to emulate an RCT that compared apixaban to warfarin, ARISTOTLE, and also looked at whether the benefit of apixban compared with warfarin was impacted by the quality of warfarin therapy (measured by time in therapeutic range, TTR).Emulating an RCT for stroke prevention in patients with AF should help to understand how transferable RCT results are to ‘real-world’ practices and whether this methodological approach can help to improve treatment options and outcomes for patient groups currently underrepresented in clinical trials.What Did the Researchers Do and Find?The researchers looked at patients with AF in a UK primary care data prescribed apixaban or warfarin and applied a “reference trial emulation” approach, in which the ARISTOTLE trial eligibility, selection and analysis approaches were applied to UK primary care data and results benchmarked against those of ARISTOTLE.Patients prescribed apixaban had similar rates of outcomes to those prescribed warfarin in our cohort and our results were successfully benchmarked against ARISTOTLE. Unlike ARISTOTLE we did not see superiority of apixaban vs warfarin [Hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)] for time to stroke or systemic embolism: 0.98 (0.82,1.19) in our cohort vs 0.79 (0.66,0.95) in ARISTOTLE.We also found the benefit of apixaban vs warfarin differed depending on the quality of warfarin therapy with apixaban superior to poorly controlled warfarin therapy (TTR < 0.75) [Stroke/SE 0.94 (0.75,1.19), Death 0.99 (0.87,1.12)] whereas apixaban was not superior to well-controlled warfarin (TTR ≥ 0.75) [Stroke/SE 1.49 (1.13,1.97), Death 1.75 (1.49,2.06)].What Do These Findings Mean?ur results support the NICE guidelines on selecting treatment for stroke prevention in patients with AF and also provide reassurance on continuing warfarin in patients with high TTR.can use UK primary health care data to emulate a reference trial of treatments for the prevention of stroke in AF.can use the data and methods to look at how well treatments work in patients that would not have been included in RCTs such as those with multimorbidity or patient groups under-represented in RCTs such as ethnic minority groups and older patients.limitations include the possibility of residual confounding, a risk patients doing well on warfarin were over-represented in our cohort, and a lower proportion of Asian participants in our cohort compared with ARISTOTLE."

However, most implemented scores were developed using logistic regression, only underwent retrospective internal validation, and were not tested in important patient subgroups.Objectives To develop a gradient boosted machine model (eCARTv5) for identifying clinical deterioration and then validate externally, test prospectively, and evaluate across patient subgroups.Methods All adult patients hospitalized on the wards in seven hospitals from 2008- 2022 were used to develop eCARTv5, with demographics, vital signs, clinician documentation, and laboratory values utilized to predict intensive care unit transfer or death in the next 24 hours. The model was externally validated retrospectively in 21 hospitals from 2009-2023 and prospectively in 10 hospitals from February to May 2023. eCARTv5 was compared to the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).Measurements and Main Results The development cohort included 901,491 admissions, the retrospective validation cohort included 1,769,461 admissions, and the prospective validation cohort included 46,330 admissions. In retrospective validation, eCART had the highest AUROC (0.835; 95%CI 0.834, 0.835), followed by NEWS (0.766 (95%CI 0.766, 0.767)), and MEWS (0.704 (95%CI 0.703, 0.704)). eCART’s performance remained high (AUROC ≥0.80) across a range of patient demographics, clinical conditions, and during prospective validation.Conclusions We developed eCARTv5, which accurately identifies early clinical deterioration in hospitalized ward patients. Our model performed better than the NEWS and MEWS retrospectively, prospectively, and across a range of subgroups."

This study aimed to assess the cost incurred for wheezing episodes during five years after a severe RSV infection in children from Argentina, considering both the public health system and societal perspectives.Methods A prospective cohort was conducted to assess the cost-of-illness (COI) linked to wheezing episodes after severe RSV disease in children from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Direct medical and non-medical costs were estimated, along with indirect costs per episode and patient. Data pertaining to healthcare resource utilization, indirect expenses, and parental out-of-pocket costs were obtained from research forms. The overall cost per hospitalization and health visits were calculated from the perspectives of the healthcare system and society. Costs were quantified in US dollars.Results Overall, 150 children aged between 12 and 60 months presented a total of 429 wheezing episodes. The median number of wheezing episodes per patient was 5 (IQR 3-7). The mean cost per wheezing episode was US$ 191.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] $166.37 – $215.64). The total cost per episode of wheezing was significantly higher (p<0.001) in infants under 12 months of age (207.43, 95%CI 154.3-260.6) compared to older toddler subgroups. The average cumulative cost associated to wheezing per patient was US$ 415.99 (95%CI $313.35 - $518.63). Considering both acute RSV disease and long-term wheezing outcomes the cumulative mean cost per patient was US$ 959.56 (95%CI $832.01-$1087.10).Conclusions This study reveals the economic impact of prolonged wheezing resulting from severe acute RSV infection on Argentina’s public health system and society. The estimates obtained serve as valuable inputs for informing cost-effectiveness analyses of upcoming RSV preventive interventions.What is already known on this topic Multiple studies demonstrate the association between severe acute lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV in infancy with long-term obstructive pulmonary disease such as recurrent wheezing or asthma. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information regarding the economic impact of these frequent wheezing episodes in individuals who experienced hospitalization due to RSV disease early in life, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. To address this gap, we conducted a prospective cohort study to ascertain the cost of illness associated with wheezing episodes in children during their initial 5 years of life following a severe RSV infection within a low-income population in Buenos Aires, Argentina.What this study adds This study provides a comprehensive account of both medical and non-medical expenses associated with frequent wheezing episodes in childhood in low settings of Argentina, focusing on patients who experienced a severe RSV infection. Furthermore, we computed the total cost, encompassing the expenses associated with the initial severe RSV disease in those patients with long-term wheezing episodes.How this study might affect research, practice or policy The data produced in this study is important for estimating the economic impact of forthcoming preventive measures against RSV in low- and middle-income countries through cost-effectiveness studies. Health decision-makers can leverage this information for future decisions on implementing preventive policies against RSV in infancy."

Studies have reported differences in risk factor associations with breast cancer subtypes, especially by tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status, but their consistency across racial and ethnic populations has not been comprehensively evaluated.Methods We conducted a qualitative, scoping literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis, extension for Scoping Reviews to investigate consistencies in associations between 18 breast cancer risk factors (reproductive, anthropometric, lifestyle, and medical history) and risk of ER-defined subtypes in women who self-identify as Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latina, or White. We reviewed publications between January 1, 1990 and July 1, 2022. Etiologic heterogeneity evidence (convincing, suggestive, none, or inconclusive) was determined by expert consensus.Results Publications per risk factor ranged from 14 (benign breast disease history) to 66 (parity). Publications were most abundant for White women, followed by Asian, Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latina women. Etiologic heterogeneity evidence was strongest for parity, followed by age at first birth, post-menopausal BMI, oral contraceptive use, and estrogen-only and combined menopausal hormone therapy. Evidence was limited for other risk factors. Findings were consistent across racial and ethnic groups, although the strength of evidence varied.Conclusion The literature supports etiologic heterogeneity by ER for some established risk factors that are consistent across race and ethnicity groups. However, in non-White populations evidence is limited. Larger, more comparable data in diverse populations is needed to better characterize breast cancer etiologic heterogeneity."

Digital health interventions (DHIs) hold promise for reaching large population groups, but raise health equity concerns. A subgroup (n=6978) of 20 to 74-year-old participants of the population-based Healthy Finland survey were offered an opportunity to start using a web-based DHI, aiming to support adoption of healthy lifestyle habits. We used adjusted logistic regression models to identify significant predictors of DHI uptake. Women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.69, 95% CI 1.49–1.93), middle-aged individuals (1.47, 1.21–1.79), and those with higher income (aORs between 1.76–1.97) and education (1.10, 1.08–1.12) had higher odds of DHI uptake. Moreover, healthier lifestyle indicated by better diet quality (1.07, 1.04– 1.10), less frequent or non-smoking (aORs between 1.59–2.29), sleep (0.58, 0.37–0.86), higher functional capacity (1.06, 1.02–1.11), and good overall current health (1.46, 1.15– 1.89) associated with increased likelihood of DHI uptake. Lastly, individuals with better internet connections, higher competence to use e-services (aORs between 2.00–4.10), low concerns about data security (aORs between 1.37–1.76), stronger belief in benefits of digital services (1.04, 1.02–1.05), and reporting to use e-services (aORs between 2.48–6.08) had higher odds of uptake. Our findings indicate that those with higher socioeconomic status, better health and healthier lifestyle are more likely to take up DHI. Our research also highlights the impact of digital literacy and positive attitudes towards online services in adopting DHIs. These insights will be valuable in shaping strategies for future DHI initiatives."

Tumor heterogeneities have been a hot spot in cancer research because of their critical roles in promoting clonal evolution and metastasis of cancer cells and in influencing cancer progression and therapy efficacy. Cancer tissue microbiome as part of tumor microenvironment can influence tumor heterogeneities both directly and indirectly through their “intimate” intracellular and intercellular interactions with human cells including tumor, immune and normal cells. From an ecological perspective, the relationship between tumor microenvironment and tumor heterogeneity is not unlike that between habitat heterogeneity and community heterogeneity. That is, their heterogeneities should be interwoven with each other, and then the net effects of the microbiomes on cancer development, malignant progression, and therapy responses can be either promotive or suppressive depending on the so-termed immune-oncology-microbiome axis or trio. The objective of this study is to assess and interpret the heterogeneity and often conflated diversity of tumor microbiomes. Our findings, from reanalyzing a big microbiome dataset originally distilled from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database by Poore et al. (2020, Nature) including 16555 tumor microbiome samples from the primary tumor (PT), solid tissue normal (SN) and blood derived normal (B) of 32 cancer types, include: (i) The tumor microbiome heterogeneity (diversity) cancer relationship HCR (DCR), i.e., the heterogeneity (diversity) differences between PT vs. SN (B) are only significantly in approximately 10%-40% depending on the cancer types. (ii) The pan-tumor HCR (DCR), i.e., microbiome heterogeneity/diversity differences of same tissue type (e.g., PT) across cancer types (e.g., lung vs. breast cancers) are approximately twice the range of previous tumor-HCR (DCR) (i.e., 30%-80% for pan-tumor vs. 10%-40% of tumor scale). In both tumor and pan-tumor scales, the heterogeneity differences ranges are wider than the diversity ranges. (iii) The NSR values range between 0.4 and 0.8 and in 75% cases NSR>0.5, suggesting that tumor selection plays a dominant role than stochastic drifts in shaping microbiome diversity/heterogeneity patterns. Furthermore, the NSR values are significantly different between PT and NT (B) in 50%-100% (mostly 70%-80%) cases across 32 cancer types, further confirming that it should be the tumor growth that is largely responsible for the dominance of selection forces. Finally, we postulate that the HCR (DCR) should be dynamic with tumor types, progression, microbial taxa, host genomics and physiology, therapy and diets."

One of the primary difficulties lies in the underreporting and underdiagnosis of psychosis, compounded by the stigma surrounding mental health and the individuals’ often diminished insight into their condition. Existing efforts leveraging Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to retrospectively identify psychosis typically rely on structured data, such as medical codes and patient demographics, which frequently lack essential information. Addressing these challenges, our study leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to analyze psychiatric admission notes for the diagnosis of psychosis, providing a detailed evaluation of rule-based algorithms, machine learning models, and pre-trained language models. Additionally, the study investigates the effectiveness of employing keywords to streamline extensive note data before training and evaluating the models. Analyzing 4,617 initial psychiatric admission notes (1,196 cases of psychosis versus 3,433 controls) from 2005 to 2019, we discovered that the XGBoost classifier employing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features derived from notes pre-selected by expert-curated keywords, attained the highest performance with an F1 score of 0.8881 (AUROC [95% CI]: 0.9725 [0.9717, 0.9733]). BlueBERT demonstrated comparable efficacy an F1 score of 0.8841 (AUROC [95% CI]: 0.97 [0.9580, 0.9820]) on the same set of notes. Both models markedly outperformed traditional International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based detection methods from discharge summaries, which had an F1 score of 0.7608, thus improving the margin by 0.12. Furthermore, our findings indicate that keyword pre-selection markedly enhances the performance of both machine learning and pre-trained language models. This study illustrates the potential of NLP techniques to improve psychosis detection within admission notes and aims to serve as a foundational reference for future research on applying NLP for psychosis identification in EHR notes."

Variants of PLCG2 cause PLCγ2-associated immune dysregulation (PLAID), a family of conditions that are classified by mutational effect. PLAID with cold urticaria (CU-PLAID) is caused by in-frame deletions of PLCG2 that are dominant negative at physiologic temperatures but become spontaneously active at sub-physiologic temperatures.Objective To identify genetic lesions that cause PLAID by combining RNA sequencing of full-length PLCG2 with whole genome sequencing.Methods We studied nine probands with antibody deficiency and a positive evaporative cooling test, together with two known CU-PLAID patients and three healthy subjects. Illumina sequencing was performed on full-length PLCG2 cDNA synthesized from peripheral blood mononuclear cell RNA and whole genome sequencing was used to identify genetic lesions. Novel alternate transcripts were overexpressed in the Plcg2-deficient DT40 cell overexpression system. ERK phosphorylation was quantified by flow cytometry with and without BCR crosslinking.Results Two probands expressed novel alternative transcripts of PLCG2 with in-frame deletions. The first, expressing PLCG2 without exons 18-19, carried a splice site mutation in intron 19. The second, expressing PLCG2 without exons 19-22, carried a 14kb de novo deletion of PLCG2. DT40 cells overexpressing the exon 18-19 or exon 19-22 deletions failed to phosphorylate ERK in response to BCR crosslinking.Conclusion In addition to autosomal dominant genomic deletions, de novo deletions and splice site mutations of PLCG2 can also cause CU-PLAID. All of these can be identified by cDNA-based sequencing.Capsule Summary By identifying both the first de novo and splice site variants to cause PLCG2-associated immune dysregulation with cold urticaria (CU-PLAID), we demonstrate the diagnostic utility of PLCG2-specific RNA-sequencing."

The condition has an unpredictable but ultimately terminal trajectory that poses a number of challenges for patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. While the diagnosis and disclosure are critical periods for intervention and support, knowledge regarding the relational, communicational and psychodynamic forces that occur within the process of diagnostic disclosure is relatively limited.Objectives The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of persons living with ALS in the diagnosis and disclosure of the condition, and the experiences of their caregivers.Methods We conducted a focus group and in-depth individual interviews with Canadians living with ALS (n = 9), family caregivers (n = 7), a professional caregiver (n = 1), and one past caregiver (1). The interviews were transcribed, cleaned, and anonymized, and then entered into NVivo 11 for thematic analysis.Results Participants discussed the diagnosis process, including the inklings and subtle changes prior to diagnosis, attempts at self-diagnosis, and the lengthy assessment process. Time was also a consideration in the disclosure process, in which participants shared how the diagnosis disclosure was the product of longstanding conversations with their care providers. It was described as rarely a shock to finally have confirmation. Additionally, participants shared their information seeking strategies and needs for a diagnosis that, for them, typically came with insufficient information on the disease, prognosis, and next steps.Significance This project serves as an initial step in bridging the relevant gaps in our knowledge and understanding towards improved patient-centered care practices in the diagnosis and disclosure of ALS."

Here, we mapped genetic risk for T2D and its comorbidities to proteins, mechanistic pathways and clinical outcomes using proteogenomic data from a population-scale biobank and two randomized controlled trials.Methods We tested polygenic scores (PGS) for T2D and its cardiometabolic comorbidities, plus five partitioned T2D PGS (beta cell, lipodystrophy, liver lipid, obesity, and liver lipid), for association with 2,922 circulating proteins in 54,306 multi-ancestry participants (of which 42,452 were unrelated and without prevalent cardiometabolic disease) from the UK Biobank (UKB). Then, we tested the PGS-associated proteins for association with incident cardiometabolic complications in two cardiovascular outcome trials among T2D patients with proteogenomic data: EXSCEL (N=2,823) and DECLARE-TIMI 58 (N=915). We assessed causality using two-sample Mendelian randomization and mediation.Results We identified 839 unique proteins significantly associated with any T2D PGS and 1,005 proteins that were associated with at least one cardiometabolic PGS. Some PGS-associated proteins such as TFF3, EFEMP1, and MMP12 were in turn associated with renal and cardiovascular trial outcomes. PGS association patterns revealed shared pathways, e.g., complement cascade, cholesterol metabolism, IGF signaling. The proteins underlying these pathways, such as LPA, C1S, and IGFBP2, were consistently associated with clinical trial outcomes or identified via causal inference.Conclusions This proteogenomic study revealed proteins and mechanistic pathways underlying T2D and related comorbidities, advancing our understanding of T2D pathobiology and identifying putative biomarkers.

The issue is particularly challenging for healthcare systems in developing countries, where interventions are required. Although there has been a decline in neonatal mortality worldwide, comprehensive data on the patterns of neonatal mortality and the contributing factors in rural regions of Ethiopia is lacking.Objective To determine neonatal mortality trends and mortality in rural Ethiopia using 2011-2019 DHS dataMethods Ethiopian demographic health survey (EDHS) program conducted a cross-sectional community-based study in rural Ethiopia in 2011, 2016, and 2019. The study included women who gave birth within the specified timeframe and agreed to participate. Sampling was done through a multistage cluster approach, and STATA version 17 was used to analyze the data. Predictor variables were validated through multiple logistic regression analysis. Weighted estimates were used to derive population-level statistics and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.Results The study analyzed data from 22,755 women who participated in EDHS surveys between 2011 and 2019. Neonatal mortality rates decreased from 7.5% to 6.03%. Regional variations were observed, with Gambela and Tigrai having the lowest rates, and Dire Dawa and the Somali region having higher rates. Factors like mother’s age, wealth index, birth order, neonate’s sex, and presence of twins, immediate breastfeeding, and baby’s size were associated with neonatal mortality.Conclusion and recommendation Despite significant advancements that have been made to decrease neonatal mortality, there remain challenges that need to be addressed. Therefore, regional health bureaus should strengthen their strategies to enhance antenatal care (ANC) visits and promote birth delivery at health facilities."

In this integrative single-case study on a patient with RA, we had the unique opportunity to closely monitor the individual dynamics of endocrine, immune and disease variables during a naturally occurring flare-up and subsequent medication change.Methods The female RA patient collected her entire urine over 30 days in 12-h intervals (60 consecutive measurements in total). Subsequently, interleukin-6 (IL-6), orosomucoid-2, cortisol (ELISA), neopterin and creatinine (HPLC) levels were determined in the urine samples. Further, each morning and evening, the patient completed the DIARI, a set of questionnaires on variables such as subjective pain, subjective RA disease activity and emotional states. Once a week, besides an online video interview, the patient had an appointment at her rheumatologist, in which several indices of RA disease activity were determined: SDAI, CDAI and DAS28. From these data various time series were constructed for statistical analysis.Results RA disease state increased from low to high activity during the first 12 study days. Thereupon, the medication was changed, which proved effective in reducing RA disease activity. However, the levels of urinary neopterin, urinary orosomucoid-2, and urinary IL-6 did not show any response, neither to the increasing disease activity nor the medication change. The patient’s daily reports on pain, RA disease activity, and emotional states, however, mirrored the course of the rheumatologic indices.Conclusion This integrative single-case study clearly demonstrated the importance of process analysis for the evaluation of therapeutic measures in RA. In the patient studied, urinary levels of neopterin, orosomucoid-2 and urinary IL-6 were not found to be appropriate biomarkers of short-term fluctuations in RA disease activity. Instead, the results reported by the patient proved to be a useful tool for ambulatory and longitudinal monitoring of RA."

In this study, we used an unimodal cosinor model to assess the seasonality of lab tests using electronic health record (EHR) data from 34,303 AD patients from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium. We observed significant seasonal fluctuations—higher in winter in lab tests such as glucose, neutrophils per 100 white blood cells (WBC), and WBC. Notably, certain leukocyte types like eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes are elevated during summer, likely reflecting seasonal respiratory diseases and allergens. Seasonality is more pronounced in older patients and varies by gender. Our findings suggest that recognizing these patterns and adjusting reference intervals for seasonality would allow healthcare providers to enhance diagnostic precision, tailor care, and potentially improve patient outcomes."

We included the deaths between January 1 and June 3, 2023. We reviewed the research data base of the deaths as well as the clinical epidemiology records, death certificates and laboratory test results. A time analysis was performed from the date of onset of symptoms, date of first visit at a health establishment, date that dengue diagnosis was first registered and date of death.RESULTS We included 40 deaths by dengue in the study. 70% were females, the median age of death was 51 years of age, and 70% came from Piura. 51.2% presented some comorbidity and 14% had self-medicated with metamizole, other NSAIDS or corticoids before the initial medical consultation. 37.5% presented an unconventional clinical pattern at admission and dengue was not suspected in 40% during the initial assessment. The median time until the initial assessment, the diagnosis time, and the time from diagnosis until death were 3 days, 0 days, and 1 day, respectively. Adults presented a time until the initial assessment significantly greater than the other age groups (p=0.048), the diagnosis time was significantly less than those seen at the Health Department establishments and regional government establishments (MINSA/GORE) than in private establishments (p=0.014) and greater in pediatrics (p=0.018). The time from diagnosis until death was significantly less in those that self-medicated before the initial assessment (p=0.041).CONCLUSION The adults presented a significantly greater time until the initial assessment; the diagnosis time was less than those seen in MINSA/GORE establishments and greater in pediatrics, furthermore, the time from diagnosis until death was significantly less in those who self-medicated before the initial assessment. An important fraction of deaths presented comorbidities and an unconventional clinical pattern at admission, with dengue frequently not suspected during the initial assessment."

A comprehensive strategy combining biomedical and lifestyle changes is necessary for optimal health. However, the complexity of evidence from varied study designs on lifestyle interventions poses a challenge to decision-making. To tackle this challenge, our work focused on leveraging large language model to construct a dataset primed for evidence triangulation. This approach automates the process of gathering and preparing evidence for analysis, thereby simplifying the integration of reliable insights and reducing the dependency on labor-intensive manual curation. Our approach, validated by expert evaluations, demonstrates significant utility, especially illustrated through a case study on reduced salt intake and its effect on blood pressure. This highlights the potential of leveraging large language models to enhance evidence-based decision-making in health care."

This study adopted the official method of the American Association for Analytical Chemistry (AOAC, 2002) in collecting, preserving and processing UCB samples, and the heavy metals were measured using an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. The statistical study was carried out using SPSS Statistics 23.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences).The lower and upper limits for the concentrations of the studied elements in UCB range between: Pb (6.18-17.60µg/L), Hg (1.05-7.62µg/L), Cd (0.01-0.67µg/L), As (0.30-5.70µg/L), Cr (0.02-0.43µg/L), Ni (0.01-0.94µg/L).The concentrations of all HM measured in UCB are below the recommended international reference limits. This paper represents the first step in studying the assessment of fetal exposure to HM in our region. The current and future studies aim to expand the study area to include all of Syria, in addition to linking laboratory levels of HM with various sources of exposure and pregnancy outcomes observed at birth."

In this multicenter study, we combined quantitative deep urinary proteomics and machine learning to predict severe acute outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Using a 10-fold cross-validated random forest algorithm, we identified a set of urinary proteins that demonstrated predictive power for both discovery and validation set with 87% and 79% accuracy, respectively. These predictive urinary biomarkers were recapitulated in non-COVID acute kidney injury revealing overlapping injury mechanisms. We further combined orthogonal multiomics datasets to understand the mechanisms that drive severe COVID-associated kidney injury. Functional overlap and network analysis of urinary proteomics, plasma proteomics and urine sediment single-cell RNA sequencing showed that extracellular matrix and autophagy-associated pathways were uniquely impacted in severe COVID-19. Differentially abundant proteins associated with these pathways exhibited high expression in cells in the juxtamedullary nephron, endothelial cells, and podocytes, indicating that these kidney cell types could be potential targets. Further, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of kidney organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2 revealed dysregulation of extracellular matrix organization in multiple nephron segments, recapitulating the clinically observed fibrotic response across multiomics datasets. Ligand-receptor interaction analysis of the podocyte and tubule organoid clusters showed significant reduction and loss of interaction between integrins and basement membrane receptors in the infected kidney organoids. Collectively, these data suggest that extracellular matrix degradation and adhesion-associated mechanisms could be a main driver of COVID-associated kidney injury and severe outcomes."

For the hospitalization data analysis, hospital discharge records were extracted from the Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) for all patients admitted to an acute care facility for RSV infection defined by ICD-10 codes from 2010-2020 and 2021-2023.Results Overall, 26 studies, including 7 systematic reviews, were identified and summarized in the rapid review. Evidence suggests that medically attended RSV respiratory tract infections (RTI) are frequent causing 4.7 to 7.8% of symptomatic RTI in adults 60 years of age and older. Incidence of RSV RTI increases with age and presence of underlying medical conditions, such as cardiorespiratory disease, diabetes, and immunocompromising conditions. This trend was consistently observed across all RSV clinical outcomes of interest (i.e., hospitalization, ICU admission and death). Patients who reside in long-term care or other chronic care facilities have higher likelihood of severe clinical outcomes (i.e., ICU admission, receiving mechanical ventilation and/or death) compared to patients with other living situations upon hospital admission. Approximately 10% of older adults hospitalized with RSV infection require ICU admission. Although data are limited, evidence suggests that case fatality ratio (CFR) among those admitted to hospital varies between 5 and 10%. Some evidence suggests that RSV burden may be close to influenza burden in older adults. In general, the results from the Canadian hospitalization data support the rapid review findings Rates of hospitalization, ICU admission and death associated with RSV all increased with age, with 16% of hospitalizations resulting in ICU admission and with an in-hospital CFR of 9%.Conclusion In adults, risk of severe RSV outcomes in general increases with increasing age and presence of comorbidities."

Lp(a) levels are genetically pre-determined, with LPA gene encoding for two apolipoprotein (a) [apo(a)] isoforms. Isoform size variations are driven by the number of kringle IV type 2 (KIV-2) repeats. Lp(a) levels are inversely correlated with isoform size. In this study, we examined the role of Lp(a) levels, apo(a) size and inflammatory markers with lower extremity revascularization outcomes.Methods 25 subjects with chronic peripheral arterial disease (PAD), underwent open or endovascular lower extremity revascularization (mean age of 66.7±9.7 years; F=12, M=13; Black=8, Hispanic=5, and White=12). Pre- and post-operative medical history, self-reported symptoms, ankle brachial indices (ABIs), and lower extremity duplex ultrasounds were obtained. Plasma Lp(a), apoB100, lipid panel, and pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-18, hs-CRP, TNFα) were assayed preoperatively. Isoform size was estimated using gel electrophoresis and weighted isoform size (wIS) calculated based on % isoform expression. Firth logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between Lp(a) levels, and wIS with procedural outcomes: symptoms (better/worse), primary patency at 2-4 weeks, ABIs, and re-intervention within 3-6 months. We controlled for age, sex, history of diabetes, smoking, statin, antiplatelet and anticoagulation use.Results Median plasma Lp(a) level was 108 (44, 301) nmol/L. The mean apoB100 level was 168.0 ± 65.8 mg/dL. These values were not statistically different among races. We found no association between Lp(a) levels and wIS with measured plasma pro-inflammatory markers. However, smaller apo(a) wIS was associated with occlusion of the treated lesion(s) in the postoperative period [OR=1.97 (95% CI 1.01 - 3.86, p<0.05)]. The relationship of smaller apo(a) wIS with re-intervention was not as strong [OR=1.57 (95% CI 0.96 - 2.56), p=0.07]. We observed no association between wIS with patient reported symptoms or change in ABIs.Conclusions In this small study, subjects with smaller apo(a) isoform size undergoing peripheral arterial revascularization were more likely to experience occlusion in the perioperative period and/or require re-intervention. Larger cohort studies identifying the mechanism and validating these preliminary data are needed to improve understanding of long-term peripheral vascular outcomes.Key Findings 25 subjects with symptomatic PAD underwent open or endovascular lower extremity revascularization in a small cohort. Smaller apo(a) isoforms were associated with occlusion of the treated lesion(s) within 2-4 weeks [OR=1.97 (95% CI 1.01 - 3.86, p<0.05)], suggesting apo(a) isoform size as a predictor of primary patency in the early period after lower extremity intervention.Take Home Message Subjects with high Lp(a) levels, generally have smaller apo(a) isoform sizes. We find that, in this small cohort, patients undergoing peripheral arterial revascularization subjects with small isoforms are at an increased risk of treated vessel occlusion in the perioperative period.Table of Contents Summary Subjects with symptomatic PAD requiring lower extremity revascularization have high median Lp(a) levels. Individuals with smaller apo(a) weighted isoform size (wIS) have lower primary patency rates and/or require re-intervention."

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically foundational large language models (LLMs), into an analysis pipeline may overcome some of the current limitations of modest input sizes, inaccuracies, biases, and incomplete knowledge bases.Objective To explore the effectiveness of using an LLM for generating realistic clinical data and other LLMs for summarizing and synthesizing information in a model system, simulating a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in epilepsy to demonstrate the potential of inductive reasoning via medical chart review.Design An LLM-generated simulated RCT based on a RCT for treatment with an anti-seizure medication, cenobamate, including a placebo arm and a full-strength drug arm, evaluated by an LLM-based pipeline versus a human reader.Setting Simulation based on realistic seizure diaries, treatment effects, reported symptoms and clinical notes generated by LLMs with multiple different neurologist writing styles.Participants Simulated cohort of 240 patients, divided 1:1 into placebo and drug arms.Intervention Utilization of LLMs for the generation of clinical notes and for the synthesis of data from these notes, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cenobamate in seizure control either with a human evaluator or AI-pipeline.Measures The AI and human analysis focused on identifying the number of seizures, symptom reports, and treatment efficacy, with statistical analysis comparing the 50%-responder rate and median percentage change between the placebo and drug arms, as well as side effect rates in each arm.Results AI closely mirrored human analysis, demonstrating the drug’s efficacy with marginal differences (<3%) in identifying both drug efficacy and reported symptoms.Conclusions and Relevance This study showcases the potential of LLMs accurately simulate and analyze clinical trials. Significantly, it highlights the ability of LLMs to reconstruct essential trial elements, identify treatment effects, and recognize reported symptoms, within a realistic clinical framework. The findings underscore the relevance of LLMs in future clinical research, offering a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional data mining methods without the need for specialized medical language training.Question Can large language models (LLMs) effectively simulate and analyze a randomized clinical trial, accurately summarizing and synthesizing clinical data to evaluate drug efficacy and identify relevant reported symptoms?Findings In a simulated study using LLMs to generate and analyze clinical notes for a trial comparing a drug to a placebo in epilepsy treatment, AI-driven analyses were found to closely match human expert evaluations. The process demonstrated the ability of LLMs to accurately capture treatment effects and identify reported symptoms, with minimal differences in outcomes between the human and LLM analyses.Meaning The use of LLMs in simulating and analyzing clinical trials offers a promising approach to developing inductive reasoning systems based on electronic medical records. This could revolutionize the way clinical trials are conducted and analyzed, enabling rapid, accurate assessments of therapeutic efficacy and safety without the need for specialized medical language training."

To support the use and advancement of these resources, a comprehensive overview of the current technological landscape is essential.A multi-stakeholder working group, convened by the Digital Medicine Society (DiMe), conducted a landscape review to identify digital health technologies for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia populations. We searched studies indexed in PubMed, Embase, and APA PsycInfo to identify manuscripts published between May 2003 to May 2023 reporting analytical validation, clinical validation, or usability/feasibility results for relevant digital health technologies. Additional technologies were identified through community outreach. We collated 172 peer-reviewed manuscripts, poster presentations, or regulatory documents for 106 different technologies for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia assessment covering diverse populations such as Lewy Body, vascular dementias, frontotemporal dementias, and all severities of Alzheimer’s disease. Wearable sensors represent 32% of included technologies, non-wearables 61%, and technologies with components of both account for the remaining 7%. Neurocognition is the most prevalent concept of interest, followed by physical activity and sleep. Clinical validation is reported in 69% of evidence, analytical validation in 34%, and usability/feasibility in 20% (not mutually exclusive).These findings provide a landscape overview for clinicians and researchers to appraise the clinical utility and relative maturity of technologies for assessing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias."

This study aimed to investigate the associations between QTM velocity and cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using multiple post-labeling delay arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI.Methods A total of 128 subjects (21 normal controls (NC), 80 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 27 AD) were recruited prospectively. All participants underwent MRI examination and neuropsychological evaluation. QTM velocity and traditional Kety flow maps were computed from multiple delay ASL. Regional quantitative perfusion measurements were performed and compared to study group differences. We tested the hypothesis that cognition declines with reduced cerebral blood flow with consideration of age and gender effects.Results In cortical gray matter (GM) and the hippocampus, QTM velocity and Kety flow showed decreased values in AD group compared to NC and MCI groups; QTM velocity, but not Kety flow, showed a significant difference between MCI and NC groups. QTM velocity and Kety flow showed values decreasing with age; QTM velocity, but not Kety flow, showed a significant gender difference between male and female. QTM velocity and Kety flow in the hippocampus were positively correlated with cognition, including global cognition, memory, executive function, and language function.Conclusion This study demonstrated an increased sensitivity of QTM velocity as compared with the traditional Kety flow. Specifically, we observed only in QTM velocity, reduced perfusion velocity in GM and the hippocampus in MCI compared with NC. Both QTM velocity and Kety flow demonstrated reduction in AD vs controls. Decreased QTM velocity and Kety flow in the hippocampus were correlated with cognitive measures. These findings suggest QTM velocity as an improved biomarker for early AD blood flow alterations."

These same instruments are often used for eligibility into clinical trials making it difficult to recruit minoritized adults into Alzheimer’s disease (AD) studies. Cognivue Clarity® is an FDA-cleared computerized cognitive screening platform using adaptive psychophysics to detect cognitive impairment.Objective Test the ability of Cognivue Clarity to detect cognitive impairment in a diverse community sample compared with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS).Methods This study enrolled 452 participants across 6 US study sites and completed both Cognivue Clarity device and RBANS. Psychometric properties and exploratory factor analysis of Cognivue Clarity were explored and comparisons against RBANS across different age, sex, education, and ethnoracial groups were conducted.Results Participants had a mean age of 47.9±16.1 years (range: 18-85), 63.6% were female, 45.9% had <12 years of education, 31.2% were African American and 9.2% were Hispanic. Cognivue Clarity had strong internal consistency, test-retest and minimal practice effects. A 4-factor structure (Memory, Attention, Visuomotor, and Discrimination) had excellent goodness of fit. Normalizing age effects improved performance. Race and education effects were similar to those seen with RBANS. Cognivue Clarity had strong correlation with RBANS.Conclusions Our study supports the use of Cognivue Clarity as an easy-to-use, brief, and valid cognitive assessment that can be used for identifying individuals with likely cognitive impairment in the clinical setting and those who could be candidates for AD research studies."

We used latent class analysis to analyze preference heterogeneity between different patient groups and to estimate the relative value they assign to different attributes of imaging services.Our analysis showed that the “Experienced Patients” subgroup generally value diagnostic imaging services in both acute and chronic situations and had a strong preference for hospital outpatient radiology departments (HORD) that would provide services at lower costs, where their images would be interpreted by a specialty radiologist, the clinic would be recommended by their PCP, online scheduling would be available, service rating were higher, and travel and wait times would be shorter. New Patients significantly valued the service rating of the hospital outpatient radiology departments (HORD) and online scheduling.HORDs can be more competitive by providing services that live up to expectations better than available retail radiology clinics (RRCs). Most RRCs do not currently offer online scheduling so ease of use may also steer patients towards HORDs. HORDs have the advantage of being linked to the main medical center which has the reputation of having clinical expertise and more sophisticated technology. We conclude that there is room for medical centers to build HORDs that provide an appealing and competitive alternative to current RRC."

However, the performance of these AI algorithms for identifying SHD in a real-world screening setting is unknown. To address this gap, we aim to evaluate the validity of our wearable-adapted AI algorithm, which has been previously developed and validated for detecting SHD from single-lead portable ECGs in patients undergoing routine echocardiograms in the Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH).Research Methods and Analysis This is the protocol for a cross-sectional study in the echocardiographic laboratories of YNHH. The study will enroll 585 patients referred for outpatient transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) as part of their routine clinical care. Patients expressing interest in participating in the study will undergo a screening interview, followed by enrollment upon meeting eligibility criteria and providing informed consent. During their routine visit, patients will undergo a 1-lead ECG with two devices - one with an Apple Watch and the second with another portable 1-lead ECG device. With participant consent, these 1-lead ECG data will be linked to participant demographic and clinical data recorded in the YNHH electronic health records (EHR). The study will assess the performance of the AI-ECG algorithm in identifying SHD, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), valvular disease and severe left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), by comparing the algorithm’s results with data obtained from TTE, which is the established gold standard for diagnosing SHD.Ethics and Dissemination All patient EHR data required for assessing eligibility and conducting the AI-ECG will be accessed through secure servers approved for protected health information. Data will be maintained on secure, encrypted servers for a minimum of five years after the publication of our findings in a peer-reviewed journal, and any unanticipated adverse events or risks will be reported by the principal investigator to the Yale Institutional Review Board, which has reviewed and approved this protocol (Protocol Number: 2000035532)."

Clinical data, disease activity measurements and current treatment regarding IMRD, and COVID-19 outcomes were evaluated in all patients. Disease activity was assessed through validated tools at inclusion and at 3 and 6 months post-COVID-19. The FACIT-F (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy) and DASS 21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale – 21 Items) questionnaires were also applied at 6 months after COVID-19 in both groups before large-scale vaccination. The significance level was set as p<0.05, with a 95% confidence interval.Results A total of 601 patients were evaluated, being 321 cases (IMRD COVID-19+) and 280 controls (IMRD COVID-19 –), predominantly female with similar median age. No significant differences were noted in demographic data between the groups, including comorbidities, disease duration, and IMRD. Disease activity assessment over a 6-month follow-up showed no significant difference between cases and controls. While mean activity scores did not differ significantly, some patients reported worsened disease activity post-COVID-19, particularly in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (32.2%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (23.3%). Post-COVID-19 worsening in RA patients correlated with medical global assessment (MGA) and CDAI scores, with a moderate to large effect size. Diabetes mellitus showed a positive association (OR=7.15), while TNF inhibitors showed a protective effect (OR=0.51). Comparing SLEDAI pre– and post-COVID-19, a minority showed increased scores, with few requiring treatment changes. Fatigue, depression, anxiety, and stress were significantly higher in cases compared to controls. Worsening disease activity post-COVID correlated with worsened FACIT-F and DASS-21 stress scale in RA patients. No significant associations were found between COVID-19 outcomes and post-COVID-19 disease activity or psychological assessments.Conclusions Post-COVID-19 IMRD patients show significant psychological well-being deterioration despite similar disease activity scores. The variability in reports on IMRD flares and the potential trigger of SARS-CoV-2 for autoimmune manifestations underline the need for detailed clinical assessment and a comprehensive approach to managing them."

Early management of RDS is crucial in determining short- and long-term outcomes and studies have established initial respiratory support (IRS) among other factors as an important determinant. Despite preexisting guidelines and advancements in the management of RDS, IRS failure with noninvasive ventilation is common and is associated with unfavorable outcomes.Objective This study evaluated the non-invasive initial respiratory support outcomes and associated factors among preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome admitted in the newborn unit (NBU) at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital Eldoret (MTRH), KenyaMethods Using a prospective observational hospital-based study, preterm neonates ≤ 35weeks admitted at the newborn unit with clinical RDS were followed up for 28 days. The primary outcome was IRS success or failure characterized by not stepping up or stepping up the respiratory support respectively within 72 hours of life and associated maternal and neonatal factors. Descriptive statistics was described using mean ± (SD) for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Simple and multinomial regression analysis was performed to evaluate relationship between different IRS methods with outcome variables and a p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.Results We enrolled 320 neonates, 172(53.8%) were male with a mean (SD) gestation age of 30.9 (2.95) weeks. The mothers mean age was 27 years, ranging (15–43). 70(22.4%) 95%CI:17.95,27.47] had IRS failure and 243(77.6%) had IRS success. On multivariate analysis IRS success was associated with primiparity (AOR=2.81;95%CI: 1.42, 7.99), birthweight > 1300g (AOR= 5.04;95%CI 1.81, 14.6), low modified Downes score (AOR=26.395%CI 3.37, 230) and normal admission temperatures (AOR=0.32;95%CI 0.12, 0.72) (p= <0.001).Conclusion Noninvasive ventilation had a high initial respiratory support success. Primiparity, birthweight >1300g, normal admission temperatures and low Downes score were associated with IRS success."

We aimed to determine whether different blood pressure (BP) thresholds were associated with increasing number of TOI markers in healthy adolescents.Methods 244 participants (mean age 15.5±1.8 years, 60.1% male) were studied. Participants were divided based on both systolic clinic and ambulatory BP (ABP), into low- (<75th percentile), mid- (75th-90th percentile) and high-risk (>90th percentile) groups. TOI assessments included left ventricular mass, systolic and diastolic function, and vascular stiffness. The number of TOI markers for each participant was calculated. A multivariable general linear model was constructed to evaluate the association of different participant characteristics with higher numbers of TOI markers.Results 47.5% of participants had at least one TOI marker: 31.2% had one, 11.9% two, 3.7% three, and 0.8% four. The number of TOI markers increased according to the BP risk groups: the percentage of participants with more than one TOI in the low-, mid-, and high groups based on clinic BP was 6.7%, 19.1%, and 21.8% (p=0.02), and based on ABP was 9.6%, 15.8%, and 32.2% (p<0.001). In a multivariable regression analysis, both clinic BP percentile and ambulatory SBP index were independently associated with the number of TOI markers. When both clinic and ABP were included in the model, only the ambulatory SBP index was significantly associated with the number of markers.Conclusion High SBP, especially when assessed by ABPM, was associated with an increasing number of subclinical cardiovascular injury markers in adolescents."

Data on acceptance physical interventions in PwHNC are rare. The ‘OSHO #94’ trial investigates the short- and medium-term effects of individualized home exercise in PwHNC on QoL, physical activity and functionality. The study includes a feasibility phase in order to evaluate the acceptance (Phase A), followed by a consecutive QoL endpoint Phase B. Here we present the study protocol as well as the feasibility results.Methods and analysis This prospective, multicentre, single-arm intervention study includes PwHNC ≥18 years of age in aftercare or palliative care with stable remission under immunotherapy. The study opened in January 01, 2021, with estimated completion by December 31, 2024. The PwHNC receive an individualized home exercise program consisting of mobilization, coordination, strengthening and stretching exercises. This should be carried out at least three times a week over 12 weeks for 15 to 30 minutes, supplemented by aerobic training two to three times a week for 30 minutes (intervention). Once weekly telephone calls with a physiotherapist are performed. Subsequently, there is a 12-week follow-up (FU) without exercise specifications/contact. Outcomes are measured before and after the intervention and following the FU. Primary outcome of the feasibility phase (Phase A, n = 25) was the determination of the dropout rate during the intervention with a termination cut off if more than 30% PwHNC withdrew premature. The primary outcome of phases A + B (N = 53) are the change in global QoL score from pre- to post-intervention (EORTC QLQ-C30). Secondary outcomes include clinical and patient-reported measures, training details as well as functional diagnostic data (e.g. level of physical activity, training frequency, flexibility, fall risk and aerobic performance).Results 25 PwHNC were enrolled onto the feasibility cohort. Only16% (4/25 patients) did not complete the study. Therefore, individualized home exercise programs in PwHNC seem feasible recruitment of PwHNC for phase B continued. The dropout rate was adjusted from 30% (N = 60) to 20% (N = 53, calculated sample size n = 42 PwHNC and 20% (n = 11) to dropout).Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Rostock, University of Halle-Wittenberg and University of Greifswald. The findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences.Trial registration German Registry of Clinical Trials DRKS00023883."

The rate of sICH is rising among young Americans (18 to 60 years). Trends in AS incidence in this age group is largely unknown. Further, the association of AS with mortality has not been reported among young Americans.DESIGN/METHODS The Merative MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters database, for the years 2005 through 2015, served as the data source for this study. This period was chosen as spontaneous ICH incidence increased among young individuals between 2005 and 2015. Our study population included patients aged 18 to 64 years with ICH identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD-9/10) codes 430, 431, 432.0, 432.1, 432.9, I61, I61.0, I61.1, I61.2, I61.3, I61.4, I61.5, I61.6, I61.8, and I61.9, excluding those with a prior diagnosis of seizures (ICD-9/10 codes 345.x,780.3x, G40, G41, and R56.8). We computed yearly AS incidence, mortality (in patients with and without seizures), and analyzed trends. We applied a logistic regression model to determine the independent association of AS with mortality accounting for demographic and clinical variables.RESULTS Of 81,878 sICH patients, 7,611 (9.3%) developed AS. AS incidence increased linearly between 2005 (incidence rate: 8.1%) and 2015 (incidence rate: 11.0%), which represents a 26% relative increase (P for trends <0.0001. In-hospital mortality rate was 14.3% among those who developed AS and 11.5% among those who did not. Between 2005 and 2015, overall, in-hospital mortality decreased from 13.0% to 9.7% among patients without AS but remained unchanged among those with AS. Patients who developed AS were 10% more likely to die than those who did not (OR: 1.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.18).CONCLUSIONS Between 2005 and 2015, AS incidence increased by nearly 26% among young Americans with sICH. In-patient mortality remained unchanged among those who developed seizures but declined among those who did not. The occurrence of AS was independently associated with a 10% higher risk of in-hospital death. Future studies will test the benefit of treating AS to reduce mortality after sICH."

This study, conducted from February 2022 to February 2024 at Hue Central Hospital, aimed to assess RDW levels in hospitalized Vietnamese HF patients and its predictive value for HF severity, involving a cross-sectional analysis of 351 patients categorized into HF and non-HF groups. HF patients exhibited higher median RDW levels (14.90% [13.70% - 17.00%]) compared to non-HF individuals (13.10% [12.23% - 13.78%]). RDW was higher in HF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% (15.30%) than LVEF ≥ 50% (14.70%). ROC curve analysis for acute heart failure (AHF) prediction yielded an AUC of 0.651 (p < 0.001), with a cutoff point of 13.85%, sensitivity of 86.05%, and specificity of 36.94%. Elevated RDW levels were associated with HF risk (OR: 1.844, p < 0.001) and AHF (OR: 3.612, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified associations between RDW and hemoglobin (Hb) (β = 2.431, p = 0.040) and hematocrit (HCT) (β = −3.355, p = 0.007) in HF. RBC and RDW > 13.85% were independent risk factors for AHF. This suggests that RDW levels can serve as biomarkers for diagnosing HF and predicting its severity. Their accessibility and cost-effectiveness indicate the potential utility of RDW in managing HF, particularly in settings with limited resources."

Having a diverse cadre of physician-scientists is critical to ensuring that the biomedical research enterprise explores the breadth of problems affecting the nation’s health. The National Institutes of Health has identified diversity, including educational background, to be important for the biomedical workforce. In 2020, less than ten percent of MD-PhD program matriculants were the first in their families to pursue higher education (first-generation) despite the majority of the US population having less than a Bachelor’s degree. Little is known about the specific challenges that first-generation students face, which makes it challenging to address this gap in matriculation.Methods This qualitative study used a phenomenological approach to examine the experiences of first-generation individuals, from the applicant stage to the early-career stage. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 41 participants and analyzed responses in accordance with a networked ecological systems theory.Results The interviews revealed that first-generation individuals put together a patchwork of support. Whereas many MD-PhD trainees struggle at some point in their training, first-generation individuals tend to lack a support system that may provide proactive advice and prepare them for milestones. Interviews shared a common sentiment of isolation due to both a lack of social capital within medicine and academia, as well as a growing disconnect from their families and community.Discussion Key interventions that would support first-generation students include greater access to high-quality information about the pathway, tailored mentorship throughout training, and more financial resources at the application stage. Trainees and early career physician-scientists seek more flexibility, opportunities for finding community, financial guidance and options, and mentorship around building their careers."

This study aims to deepen understanding of the diabetes burden in Ga Mashie, an urban-poor area in Accra, Ghana.Methods We conducted a cluster survey of adults over 25 years in 80 enumeration areas within Ga Mashie, targeting 959 eligible households based on the 2021 census. Household-level data included household membership and structure, water and sanitation, cooking infrastructure, and asset ownership. Individual-level data encompassed demographics, lifestyle behaviours, and biometric measurements. Diabetes was identified through random blood glucose levels ≥11.1 mmol/L or a prior diagnosis, with obesity defined as a body mass index >30 kg/m2 and central obesity as a waist circumference-to-height ratio >0.5. We derived weighted prevalence estimates and compared these estimates by age, sex, and wealth, using unadjusted odds-ratios (OR).Results The survey, achieving a 67% response rate, covered 854 individuals from 644 households. It unveiled a notable prevalence of non-communicable disease risk factors: 47.2% for alcohol consumption (95% CI: 43.7-50.8), 73.3% for insufficient physical activity (95% CI: 69.1-77.1), 28.9% for unhealthy snack consumption (95% CI: 24.5-33.7), 35.1% for obesity (95% CI: 31.3-39.1), and 74.5% for central obesity (95% CI: 70.8-77.9). Diabetes affected 8.2% of the population aged ≥25 (95% CI: 6.4-10.5), with disparities evident across age, wealth, and sex (2.66 greater odds in females for diabetes [95% CI: 1.38-5.12]).Conclusion Diabetes and its risk factors are highly prevalent in Ga Mashie, with significant demographic disparities underscoring the need for targeted interventions. The study highlights the critical challenge diabetes poses in urban-poor contexts, emphasizing the necessity for tailored health initiatives to mitigate this burden.KEY QUESTIONS What is already known on this topic?
Diabetes and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) present a significant global health challenge, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where there is a notable lack of data on the prevalence and distribution of these conditions and their associated risk factors. The variation in diabetes epidemiology and its risk factors between urban and rural settings highlights the need for context-specific intervention strategies.What this study adds?
In Ga Mashie, the prevalence of diabetes is approximately 8%, with over 25% of individuals with diabetes being unaware of their condition and more than a third of those diagnosed not achieving control over the disease. There is also a high prevalence of NCD risk factors, such as insufficient physical activity (73%) and central obesity (75%).The distribution of diabetes and NCD risk factors is uneven across different demographic groups, with women and older adults bearing a higher burden of physical inactivity, adiposity, and diagnosed but uncontrolled diabetes, whereas men are more prone to engage in smoking and alcohol consumption.How might this study affect research, practice, or policy?
Given the substantial health threat posed by diabetes and NCDs in Ga Mashie, there is a pressing need for interventions at the individual, community, and health system levels. These interventions should be designed with consideration of the unequal disease and risk factor distribution and should aim to address the specific contextual factors driving these disparities."

This study assesses the publication status of 95 clinical trials of 3 COVID-19 vaccines developed by Chinese companies that received a World Health Organization Emergency Use Listing (EUL) and have been marketed globally. We searched trial registries and the scientific literature to assess current trial status and the public availability of results.After excluding 2 withdrawn trials, we found that at least 62/93 trials (67%) involving 307,933 patients had verifiably been completed or terminated. Only 44 of those 62 trials (71%) had published results in a peer-reviewed journal; none had tabular summary results available on a trial registry. The results of 18/62 (29%) verifiably completed or terminated trials remained unpublished. The trial status information stated in trial registries was often incorrect.Our findings reveal a substantial gap between the disclosure practices of the 3 Chinese companies and global best practice benchmarks. Transparency and global public trust in Chinese biopharmaceutical products could be improved by aligning Chinese legal disclosure requirements with those prevalent in more mature markets, or by the voluntary adoption of stronger transparency practices by Chinese companies."

However, despite the great variety of frameworks and checklists available for assessing PPI, most are limited with respect to important features (e.g. applicable in specific contexts only, fail to clarify what should be assessed and reported, lack the necessary comprehensiveness or are biased in favour of researcher reporting). Thus, the current research aimed to address such limitations through the development of a new checklist, the EPPIIC, through review, thematic analysis and ‘meta-evaluation’ in conjunction with PPI engagement. A further aim was to pilot the EPPIIC through its application to and reporting on the COB-MS trial, which utilised PPI throughout the research’s life-cycle. Upon completion of the EPPIIC, three thematic ‘sub-scales’ emerged: (1) Policy & Practice, (2) Participatory Culture and (3) Influence & Impact. All findings are presented and discussed in light of theory and research. Notably, findings recommend EPPIIC as a useful means of assessing PPI in future trials."

The purpose of this research was to explore the applicability of such frameworks to guide the equitable implementation of population genetic screening programs. We searched PubMed and reference lists for relevant frameworks and examples of their use in health settings. We then assessed if and how selected frameworks provide guidance for different stages of population genetic screening: recruitment, sample collection, result return, follow-up care and prevention, and cascade screening. Findings were synthesized into a list of health equity considerations specific to each stage. We identified 5 implementation frameworks that focus on health equity. Guidance varied by framework type: determinant (explaining what affects implementation outcomes), process (translating research into practice), or evaluation (assessing implementation). Common characteristics included focusing implementation efforts on populations who have historically experienced health inequities and adapting interventions to fit local contexts. Process models also highlighted the importance of community partnerships. Overall, frameworks offered broad recommendations applicable to population genetic screening program implementation. However, gaps still exist in guidance provided for later stages of population genetic screening. To improve the equitable implementation of genetic screening, future programs may benefit from utilizing one or more of these frameworks or by incorporating the health equity considerations and outcomes compiled in this analysis."

Effective as of January 2023, it emphasizes that transparency in data collection and dedicated efforts towards data sharing are prerequisites for translational research, from the lab to the bedside. Given the role of data access in mitigating potential bias in clinical models, we hypothesize that researchers who leverage open-access datasets rather than privately-owned ones are more diverse. In this brief report, we proposed to test this hypothesis in the transdisciplinary and expanding field of artificial intelligence (AI) for critical care.Specifically, we compared the diversity among authors of publications leveraging open datasets, such as the commonly used MIMIC and eICU databases, with that among authors of publications relying exclusively on private datasets, unavailable to other research investigators (e.g., electronic health records from ICU patients accessible only to Mayo Clinic analysts). To measure the extent of author diversity, we characterized gender balance as well as the presence of researchers from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and minority-serving institutions (MSI).Our comparative analysis revealed a greater contribution of authors from LMICs and MSIs among researchers leveraging open critical care datasets than among those relying exclusively on private data resources. The participation of women was similar between the two groups, albeit slightly larger in the former. Notably, although over 70% of all articles included at least one author inferred to be a woman, less than 25% had a woman as a first or last author. Importantly, we found that the proportion of authors from LMICs was substantially higher in the treatment than in the control group (10.1% vs. 6.2%, p<0.001), including as first and last authors. Moreover, we found that the proportion of US-based authors affiliated with a MSI was 1.5 times higher among articles in the treatment than in the control group, suggesting that open data resources attract a larger pool of participants from minority groups (8.6% vs. 5.6%, p<0.001).Thus, our study highlights the valuable contribution of the Open Data strategy to underrepresented groups, while also quantifying persisting gender gaps in academic and clinical research at the intersection of computer science and healthcare. In doing so, we hope our work points to the importance of extending open data practices in deliberate and systematic ways.Author Summary In light of the significance of data access to the mitigation of bias in clinical models, we hypothesize that researchers who leverage existing open-access datasets rather than privately-owned ones are more diverse. In this brief report, we propose to test this hypothesis in the transdisciplinary and expanding field of artificial intelligence for critical care. Specifically, we compare the diversity among authors of publications leveraging open datasets, such as the commonly used MIMIC and eICU databases, with that among authors of publications relying exclusively on private datasets, unavailable to other research investigators. To measure the extent of author diversity, we characterize gender balance, geographic diversity (i.e., the number of countries with which authors are affiliated and the income categories these countries map to), and the presence of researchers from minority-serving institutions located in the United States. Furthermore, we comment on the challenges of increasing the participation of researchers from underrepresented groups and suggest changes that can be made to the current Open Data strategy to enhance representation in authorship in the next decade. By evaluating the association between data accessibility and author diversity, our study pinpoints actionable steps that the broader field of clinical AI can take to foster inclusion in the scientific community and mitigate blind spots in data preparation and/or model development."

Through focus group discussions held at a tertiary academic center, a diverse cadre of HCPs was engaged to ascertain their awareness, utilization patterns, perceived advantages, and apprehensions regarding ChatGPT. The analysis revealed three primary themes: understanding and ease of use of ChatGPT, its practical applications in clinical workflows for critically ill children and information retrieval, and the ethical considerations associated with its deployment. While participants praised ChatGPT for its engaging interface and potential to streamline tasks and provide prompt information, notable reservations surfaced regarding its limitations, particularly in medical accuracy, currency of data, and ethical implications. The findings suggest a cautious optimism towards integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), like ChatGPT, in pediatric critical care, highlighting the need for balanced, informed, and transparent applications, with ongoing evaluation of GAI technologies in pediatric healthcare settings."

Using data from the Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (N = 2,576,174 respondents aged ≥18 years in India; an average weekly sample size of around 25,000), it explores the associations between worry variables (namely financial stress, food insecurity, and COVID-19-related health worries) and self-reported symptoms of depression and nervousness. The statistical analysis was conducted using complete cases only (N = 747,996). Our analysis used survey-weighted models, focusing on the three pandemic-related worries as the exposures, while also adjusting for various other covariates, including demographics and calendar time. The study finds significant associations between these worries and mental health outcomes, with financial stress being the most significant factor affecting both depression (adjusted odds ratio: 2.36, 95% confidence interval: [2.27, 2.46]) and nervousness (adjusted odds ratio: 1.91, 95% confidence interval: [1.81, 2.01]) during the first phase of the study period (June 27, 2020, to May 19, 2021). The fully adjusted models also identify additional factors related to mental health, including age, gender, residential status, geographical region, occupation, and education. Moreover, the research highlights that males and urban residents had higher odds ratios for self-reported mental health problems regarding the worry variables than females and rural residents, respectively. Furthermore, the study reveals a rise in the prevalence of self-reported depression and nervousness and their association with COVID-19-related health worries during the lethal second wave of the pandemic in May 2021 compared to the onset of the pandemic. This study shows that social media platforms like Facebook can deploy surveys to a large number of participants globally and can be useful tools in capturing mental health trends and uncovering associations during a public health crisis."

Fairness metrics are important tools for evaluating potential disparities across sensitive features in the field of prediction modeling. In this paper, we seek to assess the uptake of fairness metrics in clinical risk prediction modeling by conducting a scoping literature review of recent high impact publications in the areas of cardiovascular disease and COVID-19. Our review shows that fairness metrics have rarely been used in clinical risk prediction modeling despite their ability to identify inequality and flag potential discrimination. We also find that the data used in clinical risk prediction models remain largely demographically homogeneous, demonstrating an urgent need for collecting and using data from diverse populations. To address these issues, we suggest specific strategies for increasing the use of fairness metrics while developing clinical risk prediction models."

A detailed clinical characterization of prodromal subgroups may provide useful insights for both clinical and research settings.Objectives To compare clinical assessments in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and those with isolated hyposmia.Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 191 patients with iRBD, 213 patients with isolated hyposmia and 150 healthy controls recruited in the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. The earliest available assessment for each participant was selected. Our analysis investigated and compared the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson’s Disease Autonomic Dysfunction (SCOPA-AUT) and Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts I, II and III scores across the three groups. To assess differences, after adjusting for age and sex, we employed permutations testing. We further investigated the specific question items that contributed most significantly to the observed variations between the groups.Results We found significant differences between the healthy control group and a combined prodromal group across all assessment categories, with prodromal participants displaying poorer scores. For between prodromal groups comparison, significant differences emerged in SCOPA-AUT and MDS-UPDRS Part I scores, with the iRBD group presenting with more severe scores.Conclusion Our study highlights that even in the premotor stage of PD, clinical distinctions exist in terms of autonomic burden between individuals with iRBD and those with isolated hyposmia."

It was a much-anticipated alternative vaccine for people that had either suffered an adverse event to–and/or were hesitant to receive–one of the mRNA or adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccines. Although safety from clinical trials was reassuring, small trial population size, relatively low administration rates worldwide and limited post-licensure intelligence meant potential rare adverse events were underinformed.Methods We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) spontaneously reported to SAFEVAC, the integrated vaccine safety surveillance system used by Victoria and Western Australia, Australia. Reports received from 14 Feb 2022 to 30 June 2023 were analysed by vaccinee demographics, reported reactions and COVID-19 vaccine dose received and compared as reporting rates (RR) per 100,000 doses administered.Results 356 AEFI reports were received, following 102,946 Nuvaxovid doses administered. Rates were higher post dose 1 than dose 2 (rate ratio 1.5, p=0.0008); primary series than booster (rate ratio 2.4, p<0.0001); in females than males (rate ratio 1.4, p<0.01), especially those aged 30-49 years (RR=1.6, p=0.002).Serious AEFI included 76 chest pain (RR=73.8), two myocarditis (RR=1.9) and 20 pericarditis (RR=19.4). No cases of Guillain-Barré or thrombosis with thrombocytopaenia syndromes were reported and no deaths attributable to vaccination.Conclusion The shared SAFEVAC platform enables pooling of clinically reviewed data across jurisdictions, increasing the safety profile evidence-base of novel vaccines like Nuvaxovid and improving the odds for identification and description of rare events across all vaccines.Key public health messageWhat did you want to address in this study and why?What did you want to address in this study and why?Nuvaxovid is a protein-based vaccine for protection against COVID-19. Nuvaxovid received provisional licensure following clinical trials in which 30,058 participants received at least one dose of Nuvaxovid. Introduced following adenoviral vector and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, some people had been waiting for this vaccine as an alternative to other brands that had risk of blood clots or heart inflammation. We wanted to inform on safety of Nuvaxovid following over 100,000 doses administered in real-world population-wide setting in two Australian states.What have we learnt from this study?What have we learnt from this study?Adverse events reported were mostly mild, transient symptoms and no deaths were attributed to Nuvaxovid immunisation. Reporting rate for heart inflammation was similar to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, but more likely to be milder pericarditis than myocarditis. For over 25,000 people Nuvaxovid was their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine received, despite being more than a year since COVID-19 vaccines became available.What are the implications of your findings for public health?What are the implications of your findings for public health?This first real-world population-wide evidence of Nuvaxovid vaccine safety provides reassurance on the risk-benefit of vaccination for protection from severe COVID-19 disease.

This study examined the prevalence and association between undernutrition, overnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs), and the associated demographic and socioeconomic determinants, among Vietnamese children, using the nationally representative General Nutrition Survey 2020.Methods Data on anthropometric parameters, micronutrients biomarkers, demographic and socioeconomic indicators for 7,289 children aged 6 months to 9 years old were analysed. Determinants of malnutrition were assessed using logistic regressions and reported as odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence intervals (CI)].Results Overall, 12.7%, 10.5% and 4.7% of children were stunted, underweight and wasted/thin; while 7.3% and 7.1% were living with overweight and obesity, respectively. Low serum zinc, anaemia and iron deficiency (ID) were the common MNDs observed, affecting 53.1%, 15.2% and 13.9% of the study participants. Older children aged 2-4 years old [OR (95% CI): 1.43 (1.20, 1.72)], ethnic minorities [5.94 (3.78, 9.36)] and living in mountainous areas [5.06 (1.18, 14.42)] had increased odds of stunting, whereas reduced odds were found in children from the richest quintile [0.13 (0.05, 0.32)]. Similar determinants were found to be associated with underweight and MNDs. Males [1.43 (1.16, 1.76)], children aged 5-9 years old [10.02 (6.71, 14.97) and children from the richest quintile [2.91 (1.20, 7.05)] had increased odds of overweight. Children with anaemia, low serum retinol and low serum zinc had increased odds of stunting and underweight than non-micronutrient deficient children (adjusted OR=1.43-1.71). Compared to children without MNDs, those with ≥3 MNDs had almost double the odds of stunting and underweight, whereas those with ≤3 MNDs had reduced odds of overweight (adjusted OR=0.38-0.60).Conclusions Significant demographic variation and socioeconomic inequalities in child malnutrition were identified. National policies and programmes in Vietnam should address age-specific, sex-specific, geographical and socioeconomic disparities to accelerate progress in reducing child malnutrition.What is already known on this topic? summarise the state of scientific knowledge on this subject before you did your study and why this study needed to be done
The triple burden of malnutrition (TBM) refers to the co-existence of undernutrition, overnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs). Although TBM is a major public health issue that affects every country in the world, it is particularly pervasive in low- and middle-income countries.There is no recent data investigating the magnitude of the TBM in Vietnam and how prevalence of TBM differs across different demographic and socioeconomic groups, especially amongst infants and young children.
What this study adds? summarise what we now know as a result of this study that we did not know before
Our analysis of the Vietnamese national representative General Nutrition Survey (GNS) 2020 data demonstrated the extent of the co-existence of each aspect of the TBM among children in Vietnam, and demographic variation and socioeconomic inequalities in child malnutrition were identified.Although child stunting reduction is on track towards the target of 40% reduction by 2025 set by the Global Nutrition Targets, prevalence is still high at10%-15% in 2020. Meanwhile overweight and obesity in school aged children is off track the target with the prevalence in urban areas increasing from 8.5% in 2010 to 31% in 2020.Stunting, underweight and MNDs were more prevalent in infants and young children, particularly in ethnic minorities, living in the rural and mountainous areas and poorer families. Childhood overweight and obesity were evident, especially among school-aged children, males, living in the urban areas and richer families.Low serum zinc (53%), anaemia (15%) and iron deficiency (14%) were the most common MNDs, and prevalence of low serum retinol was relatively low (<7%) in this population.
How this study might affect research, practice or policy? summarise the implications of this study
These findings emphasise the need for double-duty actions to simultaneously address all forms of child malnutrition in Vietnam.National food and nutrition policies and programmes in Vietnam should address age-specific, sex-specific, geographical and socioeconomic disparities to ensure equitable access and opportunities for all, to accelerate progress in reducing child malnutrition."

Research interest is particularly high in chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), especially for predicting acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term validity of a recent non-contact biomotion sensor in the home environment of CRD patients with domiciliary ventilator support, focusing on patient acceptance and usability of this device, as well as RR fluctuations related to AECOPD.Patients and methods In this prospective proof-of-concept study, 19 patients requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and seven patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) were provided with the non-contact device for six and one month, respectively. Main indication for NIV therapy was COPD. Real-world validation of the device was performed by comparing nocturnal RR values between the non-contact system and both types of ventilators. The acceptance and operability of the biomotion sensor were evaluated using a questionnaire. COPD exacerbations that occurred during the study period were assessed for possible RR fluctuations preceding these events.Results Mean absolute error (MAE) of median RR between the NIV device and the non-contact system, based on 2326 nights, was 0.78 (SD: 1.96) breaths per minute (brpm). MAE between the IMV device and the non-contact system was 0.12 brpm (SD: 0.52) for 215 nights. The non-contact device was accepted by the patients and proved to be easy to use. In some of the overall 13 cases of AECOPD, RR time courses showed variations of increased nocturnal respiratory activity a few days before the occurrence of such events.Conclusion The present non-contact system is suitable and well accepted for valid long-term monitoring of nocturnal RR in the patient’s home environment. This finding may serve as a starting point for larger studies, e.g., to develop robust AECOPD prediction rules.What is already known on this topic Technological advances offer new possibilities for remote respiratory rate (RR) monitoring for various use cases. Although novel devices are regularly validated in an experimental environment, the often-recommended verification of this validity in long-term use, including an assessment of patient adherence, is lacking.What this study adds One of the main challenges is the absence of a feasible reference standard for long-term RR measurement. The present work demonstrates a new approach to validate a non-contact device in the home environment by comparing RR measurements with built-in software data in a cohort of ventilator-dependent patients.How this study might affect research, practice or policy Patient compliance, difficulties, as well as their needs and requirements for such long-term monitoring were recorded in order to improve further patient-centered studies. Following this premise, we aim to encourage the development of suitable validation standards, as long-term RR monitoring could finally become viable."

Following this process, called segmentation, three-dimensional (3D) patient-specific models can be exported for visualization, treatment planning, intervention, and follow-up purposes. Although several methods based on deep learning (DL) have been proposed for automating this task, there is no thoroughly evaluated publicly available tool offering segmentation of the anatomical structures needed for digital dentistry workflows. In this work, we propose and evaluate DentalSegmentator, a tool based on the nnU-Net deep learning framework, for fully automatic segmentation of 5 anatomic structures on DMF CT and CBCT scans: maxilla and upper skull, mandible, upper teeth, lower teeth and mandibular canal. A retrospective sample of 470 CT and CBCT scans was used as a training/validation set. The performance and generalizability of the tool was evaluated by comparing segmentations provided by experts and automatic segmentations on 2 hold-out test datasets: an internal dataset of 133 CT and CBCT scans acquired before orthognathic surgery and an external dataset of 123 CBCT scans randomly sampled from routine examinations in 5 institutions. In our internal test dataset (n = 133), the mean overall results were a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 92.2 ± 6.3% and a normalized surface distance (NSD) of 98.2 ± 2.2%. In our external test dataset (n = 123), the mean overall results were a DSC of 94.2 ± 7.4% and a NSD of 98.4 ± 3.6%. The results obtained on this highly diversified dataset demonstrate that our tool can provide fully automatic and robust multiclass segmentation for DMF (CB)CT scans. To encourage the clinical deployment of DentalSegmentator, our pretrained nnU-Net model is made publicly available along with an extension for the 3D Slicer software."

Statistical separation is also common, particularly in the study of rare binary outcomes. Statistical separation for binary outcomes occurs when regions of the covariate space have no variation in the outcome, and separation can negatively impact the validity of logistic regression model parameters. When data are correlated, we generally use multi-level modeling for parameter estimation, and statistical approached have also been developed for handling statistical separation. Approaches for analyzing data with both separation and complex correlation, however, are not well-known. Extending prior work, we demonstrate a two-stage Bayesian modeling approach to account for both separated and highly correlated data through a motivating example examining the effect of social ties on Acute Gastrointestinal Illness (AGI) in rural Ecuador. The two-stage approach involves fitting a Bayesian hierarchical model to account for correlation using priors derived from parameter estimates from a Firth-corrected logistic regression model to account for separation. We compare estimates from the two-stage approach to standard regression methods that only account for either separation or correlation. Our results demonstrate that correctly accounting for separation and correlation when both are present can potentially provide better inference."

Approaches for integrating rSVs to date have focused on targeted approaches in known Mendelian rare disease genes. This approach is intractable for rare diseases with many causal loci or patients with complex, multi-phenotype syndromes. We hypothesized that integrating trait-relevant polygenic scores (PGS) would provide a substantial reduction in the number of candidate disease genes in which to assess rSV effects. We further implemented a method for ranking PGS genes to define a set of core/key genes where a rSV has the potential to exert relatively larger effects on disease risk. Among a subset of patients enrolled in the Genomic Answers for Kids (GA4K) rare disease program (N=497), we used PacBio HiFi long-read whole genome sequencing (lrWGS) to identify rSVs intersecting genes in trait-relevant PGSs. Illustrating our approach in Autism (N=54 cases), we identified 1,827 deletions, 158 duplications, 619 insertions, and 14 inversions overlapping putative core/key PGS genes. Additionally, by integrating genomic constraint annotations from gnomAD, we observed that rare duplications overlapping putative core/key PGS genes were frequently in higher constraint regions compared to controls (P = 2×10-04). This difference was not observed in the lowest-ranked gene set (P = 0.18). Overall, our study provides a framework for the annotation of long-read rSVs from lrWGS data and prioritization of disease-linked genomic regions for downstream functional validation of rSV impacts. To enable reuse by other researchers, we have made SV allele frequencies and gene associations freely available."

While RCT assures strong internal validity, its restricted external validity poses challenges in extending treatment effects to the broader real-world population due to possible heterogeneity in covariates. In this study, we employed the augmented inverse probability of sampling weighted (AIPSW) estimator to generalize findings from an RCT comparing the efficacy of Songling Xuemaikang Capsule (SXC) —— a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Losartan on hypertension reduction to a real-world trial-eligible population. Additionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the AIPSW estimation against unmeasured confounders. The generalization results indicated that although SXC is less effective in lowering blood pressure than Losartan on week 2, week 4, and week 6, there is no statistically significant difference among the trial-eligible population at week 8, and the generalization is robust against potential unmeasured confounders."

This pilot study investigated 92 plasma proteins using proximal extension assay to identify MS subtype-specific biomarkers with a focus on predicting primary progressive MS. We analyzed samples from 66 MS patients (22 relapsing-remitting, 22 secondary progressive, and 22 primary progressive) and 22 controls. ANOVA identified five proteins (ACAN, TMSB10, BST1, CLEC11A, MYOC) with p < 0.05 for differentiating phenotypes of MS, four of which have been previously implicated in MS pathophysiology. However, after correcting for multiple comparisons no individual proteins remained statistically significant. Logistic regression and support vector models using these 5 proteins for predicting primary progressive, in one-vs all-models, against other MS phenotypes and controls were of low accuracy (0.69 and 0.68, respectively). While not immediately translatable, these results lay the groundwork for future studies into MS progression biomarkers."

Until recently, the curriculum did not incorporate sufficient training on research skills. Consequently, extracurricular workshops were initiated or utilized nationwide to acquire research-related expertise, aiming to bolster research output. This study aims to characterize and evaluate these training endeavors concerning research-related knowledge, attitudes, barriers, as well as research productivity.Methods This case-control study encompassed all training initiatives in Syria from 2011 to 2020, both on-site and online. Participants consisted of early career healthcare professionals affiliated with all Syrian universities and were recruited into four equal groups based on the quantity of research projects they undertook and published. Our participants reported and assessed individual extracurricular workshops regarding their gained knowledge, attitudes, and practical skills. These initiatives were compared to curricular training and practical peer-led support regarding these outcomes.Results The study included 53 on-site and 30 online workshops, displaying diverse distributions and features. Attendance of extracurricular workshops correlated with participants’ knowledge, attitudes, and research productivity (p<0.001). The most effective interventions were massive open online courses and workshops lasting over 12 hours. Extracurricular workshops and peer-led support has comparable effectiveness and associated with higher knowledge, attitudes, and practical skills of their beneficiaries in comparison to curricular training (adjusted p<0.05). Lastly, peer trainers in these workshops exhibited more publications and higher levels of knowledge and attitude than the rest of the sample (adjusted p<0.05).Conclusions Overall, extracurricular interventions and peer support demonstrated their superiority over curricular training. Despite the varied nature of these workshops and the absence of institutional organization, these approaches exhibited significant potential in enhancing research-related knowledge, promoting positive attitudes, and augmenting research productivity in resource-constrained settings such as Syria."

Understanding the impact of SDOH on mortality among adults without major chronic diseases may inform public policy in the United States (U.S.).Methods We conducted a prospective observational study using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (1999-2018) among 11,413 adults without hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, severe obesity, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, liver disease, arthritis, hepatitis B or C, human immunodeficiency virus, or pregnancy. We calculated 15-year adjusted cumulative incidences of all-cause mortality by baseline SDOH and described the trends in the prevalence of adverse SDOH.Results The mean ±SD age was 34.9±11.2 years. Over a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 275 participants died. The prevalence of low educational attainment decreased over the study period from 19.8% to 12.1%, while the prevalence of food insecurity increased from 11.5% to 23.1%. The 15-year adjusted cumulative incidences of all-cause mortality were 5.6% (95% CI, 2.8-8.5), 5.2% (95%CI, 3.2-7.3), 4.9% (95%CI, 2.7-7.2), 4.0% (95%CI, 2.8-5.2) for participants who had < 100 % of the federal poverty level, below high school education, food insecurity, and were born in the U.S., respectively. In the final adjusted model, a 1-point increase in cumulative SDOH score was associated with 33% increased risk of all-cause mortality.Conclusions In this study of community-dwelling U.S. adults without major chronic diseases, we demonstrate a pronounced increase in all-cause mortality associated with adverse SDOH."

This study compared the effectiveness of seven different commercially available RNA extraction kits specifically designed for use with FFPE samples in terms of the quantity and quality of RNA recovered.Methods This study used 9 samples of FFPE tissue from three different types of tissue (Tonsil, Appendix and lymph node of B-cell lymphoma) to evaluate RNA extraction methods. Three sections of 20μm of each sample were combined per sample. The slices were distributed in a systematic manner to prevent any biases. Each of the 7 commercially available RNA extraction kits were used according to manufacturer’s instructions, with each sample being tested in triplicate resulting in a total of 189 extractions. The concentration, RNA integrity number (RIN) and DV200 of each extraction was analysed using a LabChip to determine the quantity and quality of the recovered RNA.Results This study found that despite processing the FFPE samples in the same standardized way, there were disparities in the quantity and quality of RNA recovered across the different tissue types. Additionally, the study found notable differences in the quantity of RNA recovered when using different extraction kits. In terms of quality, three of the kits performed better than the other four in terms of RNA integrity number (RIN) and DV200 values.Conclusion Though many laboratories have developed their own protocols for specific tissue types, using commercially available kits is still a popular option. Although these kits use similar processes and extraction procedures, the amount and quality of RNA obtained can vary greatly between kits. In this study, among the kits tested, while the Roche kit, provided a nearly systematic better-quality recovery than other kits, the ReliaPrep FFPE Total RNA miniprep from Promega yielded the best ratio of both quantity and quality on the tested tissue samples."

FTMHs were classified as FTMH with lamellar hole-associated epiretinal proliferation (LHEP), FTMH without LHEP or FTMH without vitreomacular separation. Macular structure parameters, including foveal base width (FBW), central foveolar thickness (CFT), central subfield thickness (CST), central subfield volume (CSV), and retinal artery trajectory (RAT), were measured using optical coherence tomography and fundus photography. These parameters were compared among different FTMH groups.Results A total of 68 patients (39 women) with unilateral FTMH and 68 healthy controls were enrolled. The RAT of the lesioned eyes (0.19±0.06) and the healthy fellow eyes (0.14±0.04) were both smaller than those of the normal controls (0.37±0.14) (P<0.001 for both). The FBW of the healthy fellow eyes (446.8±98.2 µm) were significantly larger than those in the control group (338.4±80.6 µm, P<0.001). No significant differences in any macular parameters were noted among the three different types of FTMH.Conclusions Patients with unilateral FTMH had a wider RAT in both the lesioned and healthy eyes, and a wider foveal base in their healthy fellow eyes than in normal controls. Such macular structure characteristics may be prone to macular hole formation."

However, clinical data complexity and the need for extensive specialized knowledge represent major challenges in the current, human-driven model design. Moreover, as human interpretation of a clinical problem is inherently encoded in the model, the conventional single model paradigm is subjective and cannot fully capture the prediction uncertainty. Here, we present a fast and accurate framework for automated clinical deep learning, TEACUP (training-free assembly as clinical uncertainty predictor). The core of TEACUP is a newly developed metric that faithfully characterizes the quality of deep networks without incurring any cost for training of these networks. When compared to conventional, training-based approaches, TEACUP reduces computation costs by more than 90% while achieving improved performance across distinct clinical tasks. This efficiency allows TEACUP to create ensembles of expert AI models, mimicking the recommended clinical practice of using multiple human experts when interpreting medical data. By combining multiple perspectives, TEACUP provides more robust predictions and uncertainty quantification, paving the way for more reliable clinical AI."

Previous studies have utilized statistical and machine learning techniques to develop hypertension prediction models. Only a few have included genetic liabilities and evaluated their predictive values. This study aimed to develop an effective hypertension prediction model and investigate the potential influence of genetic liability for risk factors linked to CVD on hypertension risk using Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN).Materials and methods The study included 244,718 participants of European ancestry. Genetic liabilities were constructed using previously identified genetic variants associated with various cardiovascular risk factors through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The sample was randomly split into training and testing sets at a 70:30 ratio. We used RF and NN techniques to develop prediction models in the training set with or without feature selection. We evaluated the models’ discrimination performance using the area under the curve (AUC), calibration, and net reclassification improvement in the testing set.Results The models without genetic liabilities achieved AUCs of 0.70 and 0.72 using RF and NN methods, respectively. Adding genetic liabilities resulted in a modest improvement in the AUC for RF but not for NN. The best prediction model was achieved using RF (AUC =0.71, Spiegelhalter z score= 0.10, P-value= 0.92, calibration slope=0.99) constructed in stage two.Conclusion Incorporating genetic factors in the model may provide a modest incremental value for hypertension prediction beyond baseline characteristics. Our study highlighted the importance of genetic liabilities for both total cholesterol and LDL within the same prediction model adds value to the classification of hypertension."

While cranial ultrasound is the golden standard for IVH detection, it may not identify lesions until hours or days after occurring, which limits early intervention. Predicting IVH in premature infants would be highly advantageous. Recent studies have shown that EEG data’s amplitude and frequency modulation features could offer predictive insights for neurological diseases in adults.Methods To investigate the association between IVH and EEG monitoring, a retrospective case-control study was conducted in preterm infants. All infants underwent amplitude integrated EEG monitoring for at least 3 days after birth. The study included 20 cases who had an IVH diagnosed on cranial ultrasound and had a negative ultrasound 24h earlier, and 20 matched controls without IVH. Amplitude and frequency modulation features were extracted from single-channel EEG data, and various machine learning algorithms were evaluated to create a predictive model.Results Cases had an average gestational age and birth weight of 26.4 weeks and 965 grams, respectively. The best-performing algorithm was adaptive boosting. EEG data from 24 hours before IVH detection proved predictive with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 93%, an accuracy of 91%, and a Kappa value of 0.85. The most informative features were the slow varying instantaneous frequency and amplitude in the Delta frequency band.Conclusion Amplitude and frequency modulation features obtained from single-channel EEG signals in extremely preterm infants show promise for predicting IVH occurrence within 24 hours before detection on cranial ultrasound."

Comparative studies of the fitted filtration efficiency of different types of masks of are few.Objective To describe the fitted filtration efficiency against small aerosols (0.02 – 1 µm) of medical and non-medical masks and respirators when worn, and how this is affected by user modifications (hacks) and by overmasking with a cloth mask.Design We tested a 2-layer woven-cotton cloth mask of a consensus design, ASTM-certified level 1 and level 3 masks, a non-certified mask, KF94s, KN95s, an N95 and a CaN99.Setting Closed rooms with ambient particles supplemented by salt particles.Participants 12 total participants; 21 – 55 years, 68% female, 77% white, NIOSH 1 to 10.Main Outcome and Measure Using standard methods and a PortaCount 8038, we counted 0.02–1µm particles inside and outside masks and respirators, expressing results as the percentage filtered by each mask. We also studied level 1 and level 3 masks with earguards, scrub caps, the knot-and-tuck method, and the effects of braces or overmasking with a cloth mask.Results Filtration efficiency for the cloth mask was 47-55%, for level 1 masks 52-60%, for level 3 masks 60-77%. A non-certified KN95 look-alike, two KF94s, and three KN95s filtered 57-77%, and the N95 and CaN99 97-98% without fit testing. External braces and overmasking with a well-fitting cloth mask increased filtration, but earguards, scrub caps, and the knot-and-tuck method did not.Limitations Limited number of masks of each type sampled; no adjustment for multiple comparisons.Conclusions and Relevance Well-fitting 2-layer cotton masks filter in the same range as level 1 masks when worn: around 50%. Level 3 masks and KN95s/KF94s filter around 70%. External braces or overmasking with a cloth-mask-on-ties produced filtration around 90%. Only N95s and CaN99s, both of which have overhead elastic, performed close to the occupational health and safety standards for fit tested PPE (>99%), filtering at 97-99%, without fit testing. These findings inform public health messaging about relative protection from aerosols from different mask types and increase understanding of findings of studies of implementation of masks and respirators.Key Points Question: How well do medical and non-medical masks filter aerosols when worn?Findings: Well-fitting 2-layer cotton masks, and level 1 medical masks were similar, both filtering around 50% of aerosols. Level 3 masks and KN95/KF94s were similar, filtering around 70%. N95s and CaN99s, without formal fit testing, filtered 97-98%.Meaning: Level 1 medical masks were not better than the well-fitting 2-layer cotton masks we tested. KN95/KF94s are not as efficient, when worn, as N95s and CaN99s. Overmasking and the use of external braces improve filtration: these are potentially useful strategies when N95s are not available.Download figureOpen in new tab"

Top-performing models included neural networks (ANN, MLP, DNN), distance-based methods (kNN), ensemble methods (XGB), and regression models (PLS-DA), all exhibiting high AUC values.Conclusion Machine learning models have shown considerable promise in improving COVID-19 diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, and outcome prediction. Advancements in ML techniques and their integration with complementary technologies will be essential for expediting decision-making and informing clinical decisions, with long-lasting implications for healthcare systems globally."

We find that very few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are common among three asthma cases, but the common ones are functionally related to the S100A gene family. Furthermore, GO analyses show that the heterogeneous DEGs in HSPCs in three asthma cases can be categorized into the biological processes of immunity and immune responses, which indicates that different DEGs converge on a common pathological base. The overall cellular expression profiles demonstrate that pro-inflammatory mediators and immunoglobulin receptors have a high expression level and interferon alpha induced protein has a low expression level in mononuclear macrophages of acute asthma. The cell developmental trajectories in three asthma cases exhibit an abnormal immune cell development pattern compared to the developmental trajectory in health control. T-cell development in acute asthma is especially dysregulated for three cases with three different T-cell branching patterns. We also find that the innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in three asthma cases have a low expression level in housekeeping genes. Our scRNA-seq analyses for three asthma patients reveal a complex cellular etiology for childhood asthma and provide a new research direction for the comprehensive and systematic study of effector cells and key molecular mechanisms of childhood asthma."

Multiplex lateral flow tests manufactured by SureScreen, Microprofit and Goldsite were performed by trained research staff using the nasal swabs from each test kit, and separate swabs were collected for RT-PCR testing.Results Between 4 April and 20 October 2023, 1646 patients were enrolled and tested by at least one lateral flow test. The point estimates for all three multiplex tests had high sensitivity above 80% for influenza A and SARS-CoV-2, and the tests manufactured by Microprofit and Goldsite had sensitivity exceeding 84% to detect RSV. Test sensitivity increased with viral load. Specificity was higher than 97% for all three tests except for the SureScreen test which had specificity 86.2% (95% CI: 83.9% to 88.3%) for influenza A.Conclusions The multiplex lateral flow tests provided timely diagnosis of influenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be used to inform clinical management and infection control such as isolation behaviours."

This study aimed to identify the prevalence of HPV infection in the United States based on a large nationwide inpatient sample database. We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2008 to 2020 and identified HPV cases using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. Pearson’s chi-square and independent-sample t-test were used for the analysis. The prevalence ratio was calculated using logistic regression models and the Cochran Armitage trend test to examine trends. A total of 47,506 HPV infections were identified from 2008 to 2020 among adults aged >18 years. Most patients were female (99.72%), with a higher prevalence among the 26-40 age group and white individuals. HPV infections were more prominent among low-income individuals and in the southern region of the United States. From 2008 to 2020, HPV increased from 6.76% to 10.91%. This study provides insights into the epidemiology of HPV infection in the United States. Understanding the trends and characteristics of HPV infection can contribute to public health interventions aimed at prevention and early detection."

Here, we have developed an alternative way to make more homogeneous epithelial-like structures called “tubuloid” based on primary human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (hRPTECs) cultured from human resected kidneys and tested their efficacy by administering cisplatin at three concentrations of 0.2, 2.0, and 20.0 µg/mL. Tubuloids showed highly differentiated structures composed of proximal tubular epithelial cells with expression of LTL and LRP2/Megalin. Treatment of tubuloids with cisplatin increased γH2AX, a marker for DNA damage, in a dose-dependent manner. Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1), a marker of kidney injury, and cleaved caspase-3, a marker for apoptotic signals were expressed due to cisplatin treatment. Repeated administration of cisplatin resulted in upregulation of the cellular senescence marker p16 and enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6, indicating an induced senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Myofibroblast activation was also induced by the supernatant collected from cisplatin-treated tubuloids, which could reflect renal fibrosis. Thus, we succeeded in establishing a model of cisplatin-induced kidney injury based on tubuloids using hRPTECs. Tubuloids have the potential to serve as a novel pathological model and can be utilized to simulate the response of renal epithelial cells to toxins and therapeutic agents. Given its capability to replicate cellular senescence, SASP and the fibrosis, tubuloids could potentially serve as a pathophysiological model for chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is known for fibrosis as a final common pathological pathway."

Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) is characterized by the loss of enteric neuron cells (ENCs) in the distal colon. Embryonic enteric neural crest cell (ENCC) migration defects contribute to HSCR development in some infants, but postnatal factors that regulate ENC fate are undetermined. We sought to establish how postnatal changes contribute to HSCR by profiling the colonic microenvironment of HSCR infants.Design In this study, we recruited infants with HSCR, infants with anorectal malformations but normal ENC development (CT), and a group of age-matched healthy control subjects. Laboratory findings and clinical manifestations were recorded. Single-cell and spatial transcriptome sequencing were applied to colonic tissues from a sub-cohort of CT and HSCR infants. Patient specimens, a mouse model of neonatal ischemic enterocolitis, and Sox10 knockdown mouse (Sox10WT/MUT) were used to reveal the factors that lead to ENC loss in HSCR infants.Results We discover that intestinal ischemia promotes CLDN1+ hypertrophic nerve trunk formation and ENC death. Mechanistically, ischemia leads to defective nitric oxide (NO) signaling in ENCs, which aggravates mitochondria damage and caspase-mediated apoptosis that can be ameliorated by a NO donor drug.Conclusion We show that ischemia contributes to postnatal ENC loss in HSCR infants and suggest that NO donor drugs may alleviate ischemia-related ENC death."

Nevertheless, numerous medically important genes are inaccurately represented in short-read sequencing data analysis due to their complexity and repetitiveness or the so-called ‘dark regions’ of the human genome. The advent of PacBio as a long-read platform has provided new insights, yet HiFi whole-genome sequencing (WGS) cost remains frequently prohibitive. We introduce a targeted sequencing and analysis framework, Twist Alliance Dark Genes Panel (TADGP), designed to offer phased variants across 389 medically important yet complex autosomal genes. We highlight TADGP accuracy across eleven control samples and compare it to WGS. This demonstrates that TADGP achieves variant calling accuracy comparable to HiFi-WGS data, but at a fraction of the cost. Thus, enabling scalability and broad applicability for studying rare diseases or complementing previously sequenced samples to gain insights into these complex genes.TADGP revealed several candidate variants across all cases and provided insight into LPA diversity when tested on samples from rare disease and cardiovascular disease cohorts. In both cohorts, we identified novel variants affecting individual disease-associated genes (e.g., IKZF1, KCNE1). Nevertheless, the annotation of the variants across these 389 medically important genes remains challenging due to their underrepresentation in ClinVar and gnomAD. Consequently, we also offer an annotation resource to enhance the evaluation and prioritization of these variants.Overall, we can demonstrate that TADGP offers a cost-efficient and scalable approach to routinely assess the dark regions of the human genome with clinical relevance."
